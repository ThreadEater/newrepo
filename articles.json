        "content": "What do you want? an exasperated petty criminal asks Ruth Kimke (Melanie Lynskey), whos in the middle of the strange vigilante rampage at the heart of the new film I Dont Feel at Home in This World Anymore. Ruth thinks for a second. For people to not be assholes! she replies, which feels as good a battle cry as any in these angry, polarized times. Ruth is a fitting anti-hero for 2017: Shes depressed, shes being taken for granted in her job, and she has no idea where to direct her resentment.\n\nSo when it does come spilling out, it has all kinds of unintended consequences, some comical and others decidedly not. The debut film from Macon Blair, I Dont Feel at Home in This World Anymore is a shambling piece of neo-noir that swerves between gentle indie comedy and horrifying violence with easea combination that helped it win this years Sundance Film Festival Jury Prize. The movie, released Friday on Netflix, is grounded by Blairs eye for the gruesome, which he surely picked up working as an actor on projects like Jeremy Saulniers gory Green Room. At its best, Blairs film is like Blood Simple crossed with The Three Stoogesa clever, gritty tale of revenge at its most inept, anchored by performances that brim with goofy fury.\n\nThe protagonist, Ruth, is a nurse living a fairly dull life in an unnamed town. Blair takes special care to focus on the tiny, insignificant details that clearly weigh on her, whether its someone cutting in front of her at the supermarket, or a local dog constantly using her front yard as a bathroom. When Ruths home is burglarized, the loss of her possessions seems to matter less than the sheer indignity of the matter. The local cops do little more than take a report, leading her to decide to take the matter in her own hands.\n\nBut I Dont Feel at Home in This World Anymore is less like Joel Schumachers Falling Down than it sounds, at least for most of its running time. Ruths confused mission is largely focused on finding her stuff at local pawn shops and taking it back; shes more interested in reclaiming a little pride than in finding her laptop. She enlists her weirdo neighbor Tony (played by Elijah Wood) as backup, drawn to (if disgusted by) his shamelessness in letting his dog defecate on her property.\n\nTony is the kind of neighbor youd probably try to avoid interacting with too much if he lived near you; he has a collection of nunchucks and ninja stars but little social aptitude. But he proves a perfect companion for Ruth, and is eager to use her quest for some ineffable sort of justice as an outlet for his own boundless rage. Theyre an odd pair of heroes to root for, and there is something darkly alluring about watching them run amok. Ruth finally secures some small moments of petty triumphthat is, until she meets the shady perpetrators of her burglary and things really descend into chaos.\n\nBlair started out as an actor working with his childhood friend Saulnier, the American indie-horror director who expertly deploys very realistic, very shocking scenes of violence in films like Green Room and Blue Ruin. So I Dont Feel at Home in This World Anymores eventual nightmarish turn makes sense, and theres certainly something to be said for the bloody creativity on display. But as the film goes on, it gets hard to figure out just what kind of a larger point Blair is looking to make. Is Ruth a modern-day Travis Bickle, similarly angry at society but far less adept at resorting to violence? If so, her heart doesnt really seem to be in it by the time the stakes get truly deadly.\n\nI Dont Feel at Home in This World Anymore is most effective as a grumpy, shambolic comedy, a weird buddy picture for Lynskey and Wood that sees the formers character dabbling in brutish selfishness and the latters enjoying a rare chance at a normal human friendship. Its less interesting as a gory slapstick thriller, but the ending is memorable and Blairs skill at directing action is undeniable. Still, the film perhaps works best of all as an unexpected treatise on the state of American manners in 2017and as a story in which the real villain is humans collective lack of empathy."

        "content": "Pete Hegseth restoring names of Army bases first named after Confederate generals\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has stripped the name of a U.S. Navy veteran and gay rights activist from a ship and moved to return the last names of Confederate generals to U.S. Army bases.\n\nA MARTNEZ, HOST:\n\nWhat's in a name? Ask Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. He stripped the name of a veteran and gay activist from a Navy ship and returned the last names of Confederate generals to Army bases. Here's Jay Price of member station WUNC.\n\nJAY PRICE, BYLINE: He had already restored the names of Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Benning in Georgia. Now Hegseth has done the same for all the other bases originally named for Confederates. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee that bringing back the old names was about tradition.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPETE HEGSETH: This is something we've been proud to do, something that's important for the morale of the Army.\n\nPRICE: A 2021 law barred the use of Confederate names for bases. He got around that by finding soldiers with the same last names as the Confederates and saying the bases are now named for them. This bureaucratic sleight of hand required the names of three soldiers to restore the name A.P. Hill to a Virginia base. Bryan Stevenson, the civil rights activist and attorney, says there's no explaining away the fact that these bases are really once again named for Confederate officers.\n\nBRYAN STEVENSON: I think it's a very serious threat to the American identity to embrace names of people who were traitors, who fought against this country, who were committed to preserving slavery, who believed in racial hierarchy and white supremacy.\n\nPRICE: Soldiers enlisting in, say, 1980, he said, could shrug off a Confederate base name as a decision made in a different era. But it's something else entirely to have those names brought back and celebrated by current leaders.\n\nSTEVENSON: If Germany opened a base and called it Adolf Hitler base but said, oh, it's not - it's named after somebody else named Adolf Hitler, there is no defense, no justification that we would accept that would make that appropriate.\n\nPRICE: All the renaming, he said, is part of Hegseth's war on diversity, equity and inclusion. And he says it's especially misguided given that the military is one of the nation's most diverse institutions, and more than 20% of the Army's soldiers are Black. Connor Williams, who teaches at Middlebury College, was lead historian for the federal Naming Commission that developed recommendations for the non-Confederate names Hegseth has now removed. He says, unlike Hegseth's unilateral decision, the process was bipartisan and thorough.\n\nCONNOR WILLIAMS: For 20 months, we traveled throughout the South. We met, listened to American soldiers, officers, political figures, community leaders, advocacy groups. And that's how we ended up with these 10 names, which presented clarion, unsurpassable examples of service and sacrifice that make our military great.\n\nPRICE: Hegseth and President Trump have both criticized the removal of the original Confederate names as an attempt to erase history. Now, though, Hegseth has himself removed the name of Harvey Milk, the gay rights icon and Navy veteran, from a ship and replaced it with that of another sailor who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II. The change, Hegseth says, takes the politics out of ship names. Naval historian and author Brian Lavery says it's unusual for a navy to rename a ship.\n\nBRIAN LAVERY: If it was me, whatever my political ideology, I would keep hands off because whatever happens is going to divide the Navy. And the last thing you want is a divided Navy.\n\nPRICE: And, he says, there's another reason not to make changes this way. It could actually make ship and base naming perpetually political, changing with every swing of an election.\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Jay Price in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CALEB ARREDONDO'S \"ECHO SAX END\")\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR.

        "content": "There is no excuse for the Democratic National Committees efforts to undermine Sen. Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign. This doesnt mean, however, that the DNC was wrong for distrusting Sanders sincerity when he claimed to be a Democrat.\n\nThe fact that Sanders has just announced he will run for reelection in 2018 as an independent underscores that point.\n\nI am an independent and I have always run in Vermont as an independent, while I caucus with the Democrats in the United States Senate. Thats what Ive been doing for a long time and thats what Ill continue to do, Sanders told a Fox News reporter on Sunday, during a trip to New Hampshire.\n\nBy contrast, Sanders confirmed to a reporter in November 2015 that he would run as a Democrat in future elections, after the subject was broached.\n\nIn future elections, potential future elections, will you also run as a Democrat? the reporter asked Sanders as he campaigned in New Hampshire.\n\nYes, Sanders replied.\n\nBear in mind: One of the controversial DNC emails that was published by Wikileaks showed former chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz complaining that Sanders has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do.\n\nI wish to repeat: There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that justifies the DNC giving any candidate an advantage over another one. There is, on the other hand, ample justification for members of the Democratic Party establishment to regard Sanders with contempt for not being one of their own while trying to lead their party.\n\nThe reality is that Sanders had not been a registered Democrat until he decided to run for president. Although he had caucused with the party as a member of the United States Senate, he had long prided himself on being an independent.\n\nThat is not only well and good but necessary. As Ive written before, America needs to create viable alternatives to the two major parties. The problem is, when Sanders claimed that he had switched to being a Democrat before seeking the partys presidential nomination, people became concerned that he was only doing so to improve his chances of winning the presidency. While only Sanders knows for sure if thats the case, it seems much more likely now that he has revealed through his subsequent actions that his assurances of sticking to the Democratic Party were ultimately not true.\n\nThere are millions of Americans who, unlike Sanders, actually do identify as Democrats. They do not consider the label to be a badge of shame but a genuine reflection of their political values. When Sanders enters and leaves the Democratic Party at his own convenience, it implicitly insults all of those Democratic voters  and raises questions about what other expediencies Sanders would be willing to resort to in order to achieve his political goals.\n\nJust because the DNC was wrong for rigging the primaries against Sanders doesnt mean Sanders is right today for not acting in good faith toward the Democratic Party."

        "content": "Ceasefires are often frustrating, touch-and-go affairs, so when President Trump delivered an expletive-laced dressing-down to Israel and Iran on Tuesday, accusing both sides of violating the truce, many wondered whether the agreement would succeed.\n\nInitial signs seemed discouraging. The ceasefire ended the bloodiest bout of violence in the decades-long grudge match between Iran and Israel, but the hours after its immediate announcement saw some of the fiercest fighting in the 12-day war. Israel then accused Iran of firing missiles after the deadline and scrambled planes to pound Tehran before an infuriated Trump called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who ordered them to turn back.\n\nAfter that shaky start, the truce remained in place Wednesday, even as both sides warily eyed each other and threatened to restart military action if needed.\n\nBut with questions mounting over the impact of the combined U.S. and Israeli onslaught on Irans nuclear facilities and military infrastructure  the very reason Israel launched its campaign in the first place  a return to hostilities could be a matter of when, not if. Another pressing question: Was Irans nuclear program severely damaged  as Trump maintains  or just hobbled?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit is prepared for operations this month at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. (U.S. Air Force)\n\nOn Tuesday, a classified report by the Pentagons intelligence branch, the Defense Intelligence Agency, assessed that U.S. strikes, which dropped 14 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs and fired Tomahawk missiles over the weekend on Iranian nuclear installations in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, failed to destroy core components of Irans nuclear program and that any setback would be a matter of a few months.\n\nThe assessment, first reported by CNN, spurred infuriated retorts from Trump administration officials and Trump himself, who during a NATO summit in Europe on Wednesday lashed out at media reporting on the assessment, calling them scum and saying Irans nuclear ambitions have been set back decades.\n\nThat hit ended the war. Can you imagine after all that they say, Oh, lets go and do a bomb, Trump said in a news conference. Theyre not going to have a bomb and theyre not going to enrich.\n\nIran, which portrays the ceasefire as a victory, has taken the opposite tack, with officials saying the program will continue.\n\nMohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said Tuesday that damage assessments to the targeted sites were ongoing, but the government planned ahead of time to prevent any interruption to its nuclear program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIran had long insisted it is developing its nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes. Israel and Trump say it plans to build nuclear weapons.\n\nA man sweeps where a car is covered by rubble in a residential area of Tehrans Marzdaran district, where Iranian nuclear scientists were hit in recent drone strikes. (Majid Saeedi / Getty Images)\n\nAnother Iranian official said that despite Israels assassination of many nuclear scientists, the countrys nuclear know-how remains intact. Satellite imagery from the days ahead of the attack showed truck activity near Fordo, Irans main uranium enrichment site, suggesting that Irans uranium stockpile and its centrifuge capabilities were moved ahead of the strikes and remain unaccounted for, experts say.\n\nDuring his news conference in The Hague, Trump dismissed the notion that Iran had enough time to move its stockpiles.\n\nIts very hard to remove that kind of material, very hard and very dangerous for them to remove it, Trump said. Plus they knew we were coming, and if they know were coming, theyre not going to be down there.\n\nTrump said the U.S. attacks all but eliminated Irans enrichment program. A high-ranking Israeli official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, told The Times that Israels preliminary assessment indicates Irans nuclear infrastructure suffered widespread destruction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of the strikes effectiveness, Iran appears set to further push its nuclear program underground.\n\nOn Wednesday, the countrys parliament voted to suspend cooperation with the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency, according to the state media outlet. The vote is largely symbolic, because a decision of this nature would be up to the Supreme National Security Council, the governing body overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nLast week, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said Iran has enough material for several warheads but that was not the same as having a nuclear weapon.\n\nWe do not have at this point  if you ask me, at this time  any tangible proof that there is a program, or a plan, to fabricate, to manufacture a nuclear weapon, he said.\n\nHezbollah supporters wave Iranian and Hezbollah flags and chant slogans during a gathering outside the Iranian Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday, to honor the Islamic Republic of Iran for what organizers described as breaking American and Israeli aggression.

(Ohad Zwigenberg / Associated Press)\n\nOn June 12, the IAEAs Board of Governors declared Iran had breached its nonproliferation obligations for the first time in almost 20 years. Israel began its attacks a day later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Iranian officials have suggested it could withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty, the landmark 1970 agreement that legitimized nuclear arms for the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council but proscribed their development for other nations. Signatories can access non-military atomic technology so long as they do not pursue weaponization and submit to IAEA monitoring to ensure no diversion of nuclear fuel.\n\nWe have worked for many years to demonstrate to the world that we are committed to the NPT and are willing to work within its framework, but unfortunately, this treaty has not been able to protect us or our nuclear program, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in an interview with Qatari news outlet Al Araby Al Jadeed this week.\n\nI think that our view on our nuclear program and the nonproliferation regime will witness changes, but it is not possible to say in what direction.\n\nIf Iran were to withdraw, it would be following North Koreas playbook. Pyongyang pulled out of the treaty in 2003, justifying its move with fears that the U.S. was planning a preemptive attack; it conducted its first nuclear weapons test three years later. India, Pakistan and Israel never signed the agreement. Israel is the only country in the Middle East with nuclear warheads.\n\nIn the meantime, the extent of Israels intelligence penetration of Iran  aptly demonstrated on June 13 when Israeli forces disabled Iranian air defenses while tracking and killing top military commanders and veteran nuclear scientists  has pushed the Iranian governments paranoia to extreme levels.\n\nIranian state-affiliated media said intelligence and security forces in the country arrested more than 700 suspects in an Israeli spy network during the 12-day war. On Wednesday, the government executed three people over allegations they spied for Israel, adding to a spate of hangings for espionage that have taken place in recent days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the spring, Iranian and U.S. officials met to discuss Irans nuclear program and during Trumps visit to the Middle East in May, he said the United States and Iran may be getting close to a deal on what Tehran could, or could not do, with nuclear technology. Administration officials say the U.S. and Iran are already in preliminary discussions about resuming negotiations.\n\nBut commentators say a major factor determining Tehrans return to the table is whether Trump can ensure no more Israeli attacks, or his willingness to countenance Israeli military action, as he does in Lebanon, whose government accuses Israel of near-daily violations of a November ceasefire that ended the war with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Israel says it is acting to prevent Hezbollah from reconstituting itself.\n\nPresident Trump stands between Secretary of State Marco Rubio, right, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a news conference Wednesday at the NATO summit in The Hague. (Markus Schreiber / Associated Press)\n\nDoes Trump have the ability to restrict Netanyahus freedom of action inside Iran? said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIf hes able to really set fire under Netanyahus feet and say, No more, then the Iranians will open up to direct engagement with the Americans.\n\nBut Trump suggested Wednesday that while talks might resume, they may not be necessary.\n\nIll tell you what, were going to talk with them next week, with Iran. We may sign an agreement, I dont know, Trump said. But he added that there wasnt need for an agreement because the U.S. destroyed Irans nuclear program. The way I look at it, they fought, the war is done, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTimes staff writer Michael Wilner in The Hague contributed to this report."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Just hours after the U.S. bombed three nuclear sites in Iran on Sunday, President Masoud Pezeshkian joined thousands of anti-American protesters in Tehrans Enghelab Square. Enghelab means revolution in Farsi. The angry crowd waved placards vowing that they were ready for the big battle and calling for revenge, revenge. One poster depicted President Donald Trump as a snarling vampire. The Iranian regime has long been able to mobilize its base for propaganda purposes and social-media imagery. But, after ten days of barrages by the American and Israeli militaries, the more telling banners made plaintive and prideful statements. Iran is our homeland, one declared. Its soil is our honor. And its flag is our shroud.\n\nLate on Monday, President Trump said on Truth Social that Iran and Israel had fully agreed to a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE. But the outcome of this war may be shaped more by Irans culture and politics than by the military prowess of its opponents. Irans controversial nuclear program is only part of a larger conundrum. Can the U.S. and Israel coexist with the Islamic Republic at all after forty-six years of fraught enmity? And will the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the Islamic theocracy survive politically after the military onslaughts?\n\nTrump had already called for an end to hostilities, and renewed negotiations with Tehran, following the unprecedented deployment of U.S. stealth aircraft and bunker-busting bombs over the weekend. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace, he said, in a televised address. In a subsequent briefing at the Pentagon, his Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, told reporters that Operation Midnight Hammer, which lasted a mere twenty-five minutes, has not been about regime change. But, by Sunday afternoon, Trump posted, on Truth Social, Its not politically correct to use the term, Regime Change, but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldnt there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!\n\nIsrael has been even more explicit. Its Defense Minister, Israel Katz, said that Khamenei is a modern Hitler and cannot continue to exist. On Monday, Israel struck two of the biggest symbols of Iranian repression: the entryway of the infamous Evin Prison, where thousands of dissidents have been held, and the headquarters of the Basij, the paramilitary wing of the Revolutionary Guard, which is used to crack down on opposition. It also hit other internal security sites. In a statement, the Israeli Defense Forces said that the facilities have been responsible for homeland defense, suppressing threats, and maintaining regime stability.\n\nTrumps ceasefire announcement followed Irans anticipated response to the U.S. strikes: short- and medium-range missile barrages on Al Udeid Air Base, in Qatar, the largest American military installation in the region. The Supreme National Security Council, the chief decision-making body in Tehran, which includes political and military leaders, said in a statement that it had fired the same number of missiles that the U.S. used over the weekend. The response mirrored Irans retaliation, in 2020, after the U.S. killed General Qassem Suleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force. It fired missiles on U.S. forces at the Ain al-Asad base in Iraq. Hostilities de-escalated after that. This time, Tehran reportedly sent warning of its strike in advance. Several American warplanes and ships had already been moved last week.\n\nI suspect that millions of Iranians would not miss Khamenei, an accidental leader who stepped into top jobs only after others died unexpectedly. He was a mid-level cleric when he became President, in 1981; a terror attack had killed his predecessor. Six years later, I had breakfast with him, in an ornate room at the Waldorf-Astoria, in New York. It was during his only trip to the West, when he spoke at the opening session of the U.N. General Assembly. In our meeting, he lacked charisma, worldliness, and intellectual depth. He mumbled his way through inflammatory rhetoric as a member of his Revolutionary Guard team bent over to cut up his breakfast meat. (He lost the use of his right arm in 1981, after a bomb hidden in a tape recorder went off as he spoke at a mosque in Tehran. His hand dangles at his side.) In 1989, he stepped in after the revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, died suddenly, with no heir apparent. Khamenei had a limited independent political base, so he tapped into the Iranian military. They have empowered each other ever since.\n\nThe fate of the Islamic Republic is not necessarily dependent on the fate of its ruling Ayatollah. Khamenei as a leader may not survive this wareither because he is literally taken out of the scene through an assassination or because the war ends with such a disastrous outcome for the country that he will be forced to step down, Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me. Khamenei now faces only bad options. He will, however, avoid unconditional surrender at all costs. He would likely prefer being taken down as a martyr rather than going down in history as the Iranian leader who capitulated with a gun to his head, Geranmayeh said.\n\nThe majority of Iranians are Shiite. The sect emerged in the seventh century, after the Prophet Muhammad died, during a political dispute over leadership with mainstream Sunnis. Shiism preaches that it is better to die fighting for justice than to live with injustice. Imam Hussein, an early Shiite leader, fought Sunnis in the Umayyad dynasty, even though he had only a few dozen fighters and knew they were grossly outnumbered and bound to die. Martyrdom remains central to devout Shia. Ive travelled in Iran for decades, and I think it is among the most secular countries in the Middle East. Yet the history of the faith and its traditions still define the culture and the mind-sets of many. Iranians are also religious and ethnic minorities in the wider world, and that has bred existential fears of foreign conquest.\n\nShiism is a culture of resistance, Fatemeh Haghighatjoo, a former member of Irans parliament, told me. Elected in 2000 at the age of thirty-two, she was the youngest female lawmaker in the revolutions history. She was barred from running a second time, in 2004, after accusing the regime of torturing political prisoners and manipulating elections. She left Tehran a year later and now lives in Massachusetts. Iranians are basically against authoritarianism, and they dont like whats going on in the country, she told me. But Haghighatjoo doesnt see the regime abruptly collapsing. Khamenei could easily be replaced, she said. Article 111 of Irans constitution, which is modelled on French and Belgian law, calls for a troikamade up of the President, the judiciary chief, and a cleric from the Guardian Councilto assume the duties of the leader if he is incapacitated or dismissed. An eighty-eight-man Assembly of Experts, which is democratically elected every eight years, would then select a new one.\n\nAfter almost half a century, the Islamic Republic has deeply entrenched institutionsand intense rivalries among its executive, legislative, judicial, military, and intelligence branches. But they all crave survival despite their bickering, John Limbert, one of fifty-two diplomats held hostage after the U.S. Embassy was seized, in 1979, told me. They love power. Theyve kept it. Theyve kept other people out of it, he said. For better or worse, theyve built a system that is resilient. Theres a cadre, a mens club that includes the first generation of revolutionaries or their acolytes. For most of the past twenty-five hundred years, Limbert noted, Iran has been led by dictatorssome bad, some terrible. Some with crowns, some with turbans, some with military uniforms. And, if regime change does happen, he cautioned, Why should we assume its for the better? People assumed that in 1979. Lets get rid of the shah and everything will be better. "

        "content": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials discuss the deportations to South Sudan at a May 21 news conference.\n\nThe Supreme Court said Monday the Trump administration may deport migrants with criminal records to South Sudan or Libya even if those countries are deemed too dangerous for visitors.\n\nBy a 6-3 vote, the conservative majority set aside the rulings of a Boston-based judge who said the detained men deserved a meaningful opportunity to object to being sent to a strange country where they may be tortured or abused.\n\nThe court issued an unsigned emergency order with no explanation, overturning a lower courts preliminary injunction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a 19-page dissent and was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nIn matters of life and death, it is best to proceed with caution. In this case, the Government took the opposite approach, she said. I cannot join so gross an abuse of the Courts equitable discretion.\n\nAssistant Homeland Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, called the ruling a victory for the safety and security of the American people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them, McLaughlin said. Fire up the deportation planes.\n\nLast month, the government put eight criminal migrants on a military plane bound for South Sudan.\n\nCalifornia Judge orders Trump administration to retain custody of Asian immigrants removed to South Sudan A Vietnamese and a Burmese man, and up to nine others, appear to have been abruptly removed from immigration detention in Texas to South Sudan, in defiance of a federal court order, attorneys said.\n\nAll of these aliens had committed heinous crimes in the United States, including murder, arson, armed robbery, kidnapping, sexual assault of a mentally handicapped woman, child rape, and more, Trumps Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer told the court. They also had a final order of removal from an immigration judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston said the flight may have defied an earlier order because the men were not given a reasonable chance to object. He said the Convention Against Torture gives people protection against being sent to a country where they may be tortured or killed.\n\nHe noted the U.S. State Department had warned Americans: Do not travel to South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.\n\nSauer said this case was different from others involving deportations because it dealt with the worst of the worst among immigrants in the country without authorization. He said these immigrants were given due process of law because they were convicted of crimes and were given a final order of removal.\n\nHowever, their native country was unwilling to take them.\n\nMany aliens most deserving of removal are often the hardest to remove, he told the court. As a result, criminal aliens are often allowed to stay in the United States for years on end, victimizing law-abiding Americans in the meantime.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement said the plane landed at a military base in Djibouti.\n\nIn April, Murphy said this presents a simple question: before the United States forcibly sends someone to a country other than their country of origin, must that person be told where they are going and be given a chance to tell the United States that they might be killed if sent there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the plaintiffs were seeking a limited and measured remedy ... the minimum that comports with due process.\n\nIn her dissent, Sotomayor faulted the court for turning a blind eye to injustice.\n\nThe lead plaintiff spent months in hiding in Guatemala; others face release in South Sudan, which the State Department says is in the midst of armed conflict between ethnic groups, Sotomayor wrote. Only the District Courts careful attention to this case prevented worse outcomes. Yet today the Court obstructs those proceedings, exposing thousands to the risk of torture or death."

The ground stop was soon lifted, and in a tweet at 11:35 a.m. ET Southwest said it had resumed operations.\n\nEarly this morning, a vendor-supplied firewall went down and connection to some operational data was unexpectedly lost, spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest had delayed 1,820 flights or 43% of its schedule as of just after noon Tuesday, according to FlightAware.

The airline attributed the meltdown in part to changes to its staff scheduling computer systems. Southwest last month unveiled an action plan to prevent another operational meltdown.\n\nSouthwest called the latest problem intermittent technology issues in a social media post to customers. Several took to social media to complain about delayed flights.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but were hoping to get everyone going ASAP, the airline wrote in another social media post.\n\nA massive winter storm started the service problems during the holiday season, but Southwest had a much tougher time recovering because of an antiquated crew scheduling system that was quickly overwhelmed, leaving the airline unable to get the staffing it needed to locations to operate flights. Nearly half of its schedule was canceled during from December 20 to December 29. Some days, as many as 75% of its scheduled flights were grounded.\n\nPart of what created worse problems at Southwest than at other airlines is that crew members had to call in to the airline, rather than notify it electronically, to let them it of their availability."

        "content": "Javier Villalobos, the mayor of McAllen, a city in the Rio Grande Valley, has noticed a change in his community in the past few weeks, after a series of ICE raids across the region, which is situated in the southern tip of Texas. You go to some subdivisions that are being constructed, and its empty. You go to Home Depot, and theres nobody around there, Villalobos told me. Its weird. It feels like The Walking Dead. \n\nThe Valley, a longtime Democratic stronghold, has in recent years been used as evidence of Donald Trump and his MAGA movements appeal to nonwhite voters. In 2021, when Villalobos was elected, Republicans celebrated the win as a sign of good things to come. Amazing news! McAllen, Texas is a major border town of 140,000 people. 85% Hispanicand just elected a Republican mayor, Steve Cortes, a former Trump adviser, posted on Twitter. The macro realignment accelerates in South Texas, and elsewhere, as Hispanics rally to America First. In last years Presidential election, Trump won every county in the Valley, including one where Hillary Clinton had beat him by forty points, in 2016. McAllen had the second-biggest shift in party share of any large city in the nation, trailing only Laredo, another Texas border community. In the Rio Grande Valley, the Red Wave Makes Landfall, the Texas Observer declared, calling the 2024 election a bloodbath and wondering whether Texas Democrats were doomed.\n\nBut Trumps tariff policies have put economic strain on a region thats heavily dependent on trade with Mexico. Then, in mid-June, Trump posted on Truth Social that, by notice of this TRUTH, ICE officers were ordered to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History. In attempting to meet a quota of thousands of deportations a day, the Trump Administration has targeted cities run by Democrats, most notably Los Angeles. But Texas has not been spared, despite Governor Greg Abbotts crucial role in helping to get Trump elected. McAllen is a city with roughly the same percentage of noncitizens as Los Angeles. Raids have been reported at night clubs, restaurants, and immigration hearings in the area. When I visited a popular flea-market complex, it was unusually subdued; it had been raided recently, a plant vender told me. Since then, he estimated, traffic had decreased by ninety per cent. The wide-reaching impact of the raids is making some Republicans concerned that, as Villalobos told me, were shooting ourselves in the foot.\n\nLast month, at an event in San Antonio hosted by the South Texas Business Partnership, Villalobos vowed to ruffle feathers about the raids. Supposedly, they were going to be deporting murderers, rapists, criminals. Thats not whats going on, he said. Instead, its like a dragnetits going to affect us all.\n\nOne day in June, the heat was already punitive by mid-morning, but the McAllen Convention Center had a refrigerated chill. Villalobos, dressed in a snappy cobalt-blue suit, walked in a half hour before the fifty-second annual Mayors Prayer Luncheon, an event that aims to promote greater understanding in our community and to ask for Gods divine guidance in conducting the affairs of our City.\n\nA crowd of people in church dresses and felt cowboy hats milled around tables with decorations featuring an image of a dove with an olive branch in its beak. The day before, Villalobos noted on Facebook that he had been discussing the hot topic of immigration enforcement and how it is negatively affecting all sectors of our economy with Congress members from Texas, including the Democrats Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez. Together, Republicans and Democrats thinking logically and with common sense, can solve this, he wrote. God bless and save the USA! Online, the reaction had been mixed (I wish more Republicans shared your viewpoints on the matter; Americans first period), but at the convention center people were uniformly supportive. A woman in a patterned dress pressed Villaloboss hand and thanked him for his efforts. Its not about being Republican or Democrat. Its about doing the right thing for our economy and our civilization here, she told me.\n\nRoel Moreno, Jr., wore a black dress shirt with a gold saints medal pinned to the lapel. Moreno owns a company that does commercial and residential construction in the Valley. In the wake of the raids, he said, many of his employees were afraid to show up to work. Most of the time, you have four to ten people at a home thats being worked on, but right now were anywhere from zero to two. Yesterday, I only had two people working, and thats because they were my friends, and they came down from Corpus to help me hang Sheetrock, he told me. Moreno said that he called a worker and asked,  Hey, can you come to start a house? Hes, like, Roel, Im scared to go. I came over at the age of threeyou know, DACA, but now DACAs not even good. Hes, like, My wife, my kids are here, my parents are here, my grandparents are here. If I get sent to Mexico, I have nowhere to go. This is home.  Moreno added that, like many people in the Valley, he had conservative values: We believe in family, God, preserving our property values, and protecting our people. He declined to say whether the raids would have an impact on his politics. I mean, I keep the faith strong. I believe that God created us all equally, and that things are going to get better, he said. Were going to need to continue to extend our hands out to our friends and neighbors.\n\nVillalobos, who is fifty-nine, has a story thats broadly common to many of his generation in the Valley. The son of migrant workers, he started picking onions and cucumbers alongside his parents when he was in first grade. His older brother, the first person in the family to graduate high school, opened the door, Villalobos said; both brothers eventually earned law degrees. Villalobos typically voted for Democrats until around 2007, when he switched parties, a move largely motivated by economic concerns, he said. At the time, politics in the Valley were dominated by a powerful Democratic Party machine. When Villalobos served as the chair of the local chapter of the Republican Party, he said, we would get clobbered no matter what; in 2012, Barack Obama won more than seventy per cent of the vote in Hidalgo County.\n\nRepublican gains in the Valley are the result of overlapping forces. The Valleys population tends to be patriotic and religious, with relatively lower rates of educational attainment. Republicans touted their support for law enforcement and oil and gassignificant sources of employment in the areawhile local Democrats were increasingly seen as complacent, and in some cases corrupt. In 2022, McAllens congressional district, which had been held by Democrats for more than a century, elected its first Republican. (The district had been redrawn after the 2020 census to make it more favorable to Republicans.)"

I dont think that anything good will come out of this. If, for any reason, the regime is going to be changed, either were facing another Iraq or Afghanistan, or were going to see the Balkans situation. Iran is going to be split in pieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarahanipour, 53, whod been a political activist before fleeing Iran, rattled off a series of questions as a gray-colored shark made lazy loops in the tank behind him. What might happen to civilians in Iran if the U.S. attack triggers a more widespread war? What about the potential loss of Israeli lives? And Americans too? After wrestling with those weighty questions, he posed a more workaday one: Whats gonna be the gas price tomorrow?\n\nSuch is life for Iranian Americans in Los Angeles, a diaspora that makes up the largest Iranian community outside Iran. Farahanipour, like other Iranian Americans interviewed by The Times, described very mixed and complicated feelings over the crisis in Iran, which escalated early Sunday when the U.S. struck three nuclear sites there, joining an Israeli effort to disrupt the countrys quest for an atomic weapon.\n\nPeople shop at Stater Abbass Bakery and Market in Westwood as the local Iranian community comes to terms with the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities on Sunday. (Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 141,000 Iranian Americans live in L.A. County, according to the Iranian Data Dashboard, which is hosted by the UCLA Center for Near Eastern Studies. The epicenter of the community is Westwood, where the namesake boulevard is speckled with storefronts covered in Persian script.\n\nOn Sunday morning, reaction to news of the conflict was muted in an area nicknamed Tehrangeles  a reference to Irans capital  after it welcomed Iranians who immigrated to L.A. during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. In some stores and restaurants, journalists from CNN, Spectrum News and other outlets outnumbered Iranian patrons. At Attari Sandwich Shop, known for its beef tongue sandwich, the pre-revolution Iranian flag hung near the cash register  but none of the diners wanted to give an interview.\n\nNo thank you; [Im] not really political, one middle-aged guest said with a wry smile.\n\nKevan Harris, an associate professor of sociology at UCLA, said that any U.S. involvement in a military conflict with Iran is freighted with meaning, and has long been the subject of hand-wringing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis scenario  which seems almost fantastical in a way  is something that has been in the imagination: The United States is going to bomb Iran, said Harris, an Iranian American who wrote the book A Social Revolution: Politics and the Welfare State in Iran. For 20 years, this is something that has been regularly discussed.\n\nMany emigres find themselves grappling with deep dislike and resentment of the authoritarian government they fled, and concern about the family members left behind. Some in Westwood were willing to chat.\n\nPeople eat at Atari Sandwich Shop, a well-known Persian diner in Westwood, on Sunday. (Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times)\n\nA woman who asked to be identified only as Mary, out of safety concerns for her family in Iran, said she had emigrated five years ago and was visiting L.A. with her husband. The Chicago resident said that the last week and a half have been very difficult, partly because many in her immediate family, including her parents, still live in Tehran. They recently left the city for another location in Iran due to the ongoing attacks by Israeli forces.\n\nI am talking to them every day, said Mary, 35.\n\nStanding outside Shater Abbass Bakery & Market  whose owner also has hung the pre-1979 Iranian flag  Mary said she was hopeful and worried.\n\nIts a very confusing feeling, she said. Some people, they are happy because they dont like the government  they hate the government. Others, she said, are upset over the destruction of property and deaths of civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary had been planning to visit her family in Iran in August, but thats been scrambled. Now, I dont know what I should do, she said.\n\nNot far from Westwood, Beverly Hills prominent Iranian Jewish community was making its presence felt. On Sunday morning, Shahram Javidnia, 62, walked near a group of pro-Israel supporters who were staging a procession headed toward the citys large Beverly Hills sign. One of them waved an Israeli flag.\n\nJavidnia, an Iranian Jew who lives in Beverly Hills and opposes the government in Iran, said he monitors social media, TV and radio for news of the situation there.\n\nNow that theyre in a weak point, he said of Irans authoritarian leadership, thats the time maybe for the Iranians to rise up and try to do what is right.\n\nJavidnia came to the U.S. in 1978 as a teenager, a year before revolution would lead to the overthrow of the shah and establishment of the Islamic Republic. He settled in the L.A. area, and hasnt been back since. He said returning is not something he even thinks about.\n\nThe place that I spent my childhood is not there anymore, he said.

We remember some of those lost in the floods.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nOne hundred and four - that's the number of confirmed deaths as of this hour in central Texas, lives swept away in flash floods, many of them children. There are dozens more unaccounted for. And for the next couple minutes, we want to tell you about the lives lost and the ongoing search for the missing, starting with Bill Govani Venus. He's a veteran who served in the military for 33 years, and he's missing. His son, William Venus Jr., flew to Texas to search for him when his aunt called to say she couldn't find him.\n\nWILLIAM VENUS JR: He doesn't think twice about helping people. I'm hoping that's the situation that happened. If there's a line of people that are in need of services, he's going to put himself last. That's what he's always done.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nWilliam told us he'd located his dad's car on a bridge, and he planned to head there after he finished speaking with us. He said he's praying that Bill is out there doing what he does, using his skills as a mechanic to help people in this moment of crisis.\n\nVENUS: He used that skill set to help people all throughout his life. So if he saw you pulled over on the side of the road by him, it doesn't matter what time of day or night.\n\nFADEL: Ty Badon of Beaumont, Texas, went on CNN to tell the country about his missing 21-year-old daughter, Joyce Catherine Badon. She'd been staying at a house in Hunt, Texas, along the Guadalupe River with three friends - a house that's no longer standing.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTY BADON: We waited around at a center, the place where all the survivors are brought. And we were hoping that we would hear our daughter and friends' names called, but they never did call.\n\nFADEL: So they stopped waiting and they started searching.\n\nMARTIN: They found Joyce, but she did not survive. On Monday, her mother, Kellye Badon, shared these words on Facebook. (Reading) We found our lovely daughter, who blessed us for 21 years. We pray to be able to find her three friends soon.\n\nThere are pictures of a smiling, beautiful Joyce.\n\nFADEL: Also lost in the floods was 68-year-old Cynthie Ragsdale, who went by Jane. She was camp director and co-owner of Heart O' the Hills Camp near Hunt. This is how Ragsdale's pastor, Jasiel Hernandez Garcia of First Presbyterian Church in Kerrville, remembers her.\n\nJASIEL HERNANDEZ GARCIA: A light who shone really brightly, who provided spaces for young kids, for young women to be in God's nature - as someone who was committed to mission work, especially at our church.\n\nMARTIN: Those are just a few of the names and the stories of the loved ones lost and missing in central Texas. We remember them this morning.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE SIX PARTS SEVEN'S \"WHAT YOU LOVE YOU MUST LOVE NOW\")\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "content": "Students and others gather to support undocumented students in the University of California system, rallying outside a meeting of the UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA in 2023.\n\nFor 24 years, immigrants lacking documentation who graduated from high school in California have received in-state tuition benefits at public colleges and universities under a law that has given tens of thousands access to higher education that many couldnt otherwise afford.\n\nWhen the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill 540 in 2001, it was the second state in the nation  after Texas  to embrace such tuition policies. Bipartisan efforts quickly grew across the country, with more than 20 states adopting similar policies.\n\nBut recent court actions by the Trump administration are causing alarm among immigrant students and casting a shadow over the tuition benefit in California, the state with the largest population of people living in the U.S. without legal authorization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 4, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Texas over its tuition statute for immigrants without authorization, alleging it violated a federal law that prevents people who do not have legal status from receiving public benefits. Texas did not defend its law and instead put its support behind the Trump administration, leaving 57,000 undocumented college students in the state in educational limbo after a federal judge blocked the statute.\n\nLast week, the Justice Department launched a similar suit in Kentucky, asking a federal judge to strike down a state practice that it says unlawfully gives undocumented immigrants access to in-state college tuition while American citizens from other states pay higher tuition to attend the same schools.\n\nUnder federal law, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens, Atty. Gen. Bondi said of the Texas lawsuit in a statement that signaled a broader fight. The Justice Department will relentlessly fight to vindicate federal law and ensure that U.S. citizens are not treated like second-class citizens anywhere in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs California next?\n\nLegal experts say that its not a matter of if but when and how the Trump administration will come for Californias law. The White House is already battling the state over liberal policies, including support of transgender students in school sports; sanctuary cities opposing ongoing federal immigration raids; and diversity, equity and inclusion programs in education.\n\nWe are just waiting to see when its Californias turn, said Kevin R. Johnson, the dean of the UC Davis law school, who specializes in immigration. Johnson predicted the White House was going after lower-hanging fruit in more conservative states before California, where Trump will face firm resistance.\n\nThe potential threat has shaken Californias undocumented students.\n\nIf I no longer qualify for lower tuition, I really dont know what I would do, said Osmar Enrquez, who graduated last month with an associates degree from Santa Rosa Junior College and will enroll at UC Berkeley in August to embark on an undergraduate degree in media studies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition for people like Enrquez can be thousands of dollars at a community college and tens of thousands at CSU and UC campuses. International students pay out-of-state rates. At Santa Rosa Junior College, the average tuition for two semesters for an in-state student is $621. For an out-of-state student, its $5,427.\n\nWhat I see the Trump administration doing is trying to exclude us, said Enrquez, who aspires to one day operate a public relations company. They dont want us to get educated or to reach positions of power. And with everything going on now, they are just trying to dehumanize us any way they can.\n\nMore than 80,000 undocumented college students in California\n\nCampus and university-level data on undocumented student populations can be difficult to estimate.\n\nAlthough universities and colleges keep track of how many students without documentation receive tuition exemptions under AB 540, the data also include citizens who qualify for in-state tuition. These students grew up in the state and graduated from a California high school before their families moved elsewhere.\n\nNumbers are also complicated by changes in the California Dream Act Application, which was established for students lacking documentation to apply for state aid but has expanded to allow students who are citizens and have an undocumented parent.\n\nOut of the University of California systems nearly 296,000 students, it estimates that between 2,000 and 4,000 are undocumented. Across California State University campuses, there are about 9,500 immigrants without documentation enrolled out of 461,000 total students. The states biggest undocumented group, estimated to be 70,000, comprises community college students and recent graduates such as Enrquez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn in Mexico and brought by his family to the U.S. when he was a 1-year-old, Enrquez said in-state tuition has made his education monumentally more affordable. At his next stop, UC Berkeley, in-state tuition and fees last year amounted to $16,980. Out-of-state and international students had to pay a total of $54,582.\n\nWhat students say\n\nSeveral undocumented students from UCLA, Cal State Los Angeles and other schools declined interviews with The Times or requested to be cited without their names, saying they were fearful of identifying themselves publicly as the federal government undertakes a third week of immigration raids across Southern California.\n\nI just want to go to school. What is wrong with that? said an undocumented graduate student at Cal State Los Angeles who received his undergraduate degree at a UC campus. The Latin American studies student asked for his name to be withheld because of concern over immigration enforcement agents targeting him.\n\nI dont only want to go a school, I want to go to a public university. I want to contribute to my university. I want to become a professor and teach others and support the state of California, he said. Why are we so bent on keeping students from getting an education and giving back?\n\nSandra, a Cal State Northridge student who asked to be only identified by her first name, had a similar view. An undocumented immigrant whose parents brought her from Mexico to Los Angeles at age two, she said she would not be in college without the in-state tuition law.\n\nI was not eligible for DACA, so money is thin, Sandra said, referencing the Obama-era program that gave work authorization to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children but hasnt taken new applications since 2021. We save and we squeeze all we can out of fellowships and scholarships to pay in hopes that we use our education to make a difference and make an income later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegal questions\n\nThe Trump administrations challenge to the tuition rules rest on a 1996 federal law that says people in the U.S. without legal permission should not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state ... for any post-secondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit ... without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.\n\nThere are questions about exactly what that means, said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA Law School. Does that apply to universities that do not use residency as a requirement for the tuition rate but instead use high school graduation in the state? he said, explaining that state practices differ.\n\nIn California, an undocumented immigrant who did not graduate from a high school in the state would typically not qualify for reduced tuition.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued in court that giving in-state tuition to immigrants without proper authorization violates the federal law. Some Trump opponents point out that the law does not speak specifically to tuition rates, although courts have interpreted the word benefit to include cheaper tuition.\n\nIn the recent Texas case, undocumented students, represented by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, have filed a motion in court, asking the judge to allow them to argue in support of upholding reduced tuition rates.\n\nThe tuition policies have survived other legal challenges.\n\nBefore Trump administration intervened, the Texas law appeared to be legally sound after a federal appeals court ruled in 2023 that the University of North Texas could charge out-of-state students more than it charges in-state undocumented immigrants. In that case, the court said the plaintiffs did not make good case that out-of state students were illegally treated differently than noncitizens. But the court suggested there could be other legal challenges to tuition rates for immigrants lacking documentation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe California law has also withstood challenges. The state Supreme Court upheld its legality in 2010 after out-of-state students sued. The next year, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case.\n\nThe California court concluded that undocumented immigrants were not receiving preferential treatment because of their immigration status but because they attended and graduated from California schools. Justices said U.S. citizens who attended and graduated from the states schools had the same opportunity.\n\nStill, momentum has built to abolish in-state tuition rates for immigrants without legal documentation.\n\nThis year, lawmakers in Florida  which had a rule on the books for more than a decade allowing tuition waivers for undocumented students  eliminated the option. Prior to the federal action against Texas, legislators in the state tried and failed to follow Floridas lead. During this years legislative sessions, bills were also introduced in Kansas and Minnesota, although they have not passed."

A judge continued his bond on Monday, and Nassar remains in custody at the Wayne County Jail.\n\nAn attorney listed for Nassar did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nNassar's 3,200-square-foot home was listed for sale in 2018, drawing attention to his eye-catching interior design. NBC's \"TODAY\" wrote about the house, known as \"Lion Gate Estate,\" at the time.\n\nAccording to Today.com, the home had been in Nassar's family since the 1950s, and he inherited it after his father's death. He said at the time that he chose to decorate following his own style, which leaned toward Art Deco design and cabaret influences.\n\nMarc Gregor\n\n\"I find it an entertaining place to live,\" Nassar said. \"You know, you walk by something, and after a while, you dont pay attention. This house, you pay attention!\"\n\nNassar said he chose to list his beloved home because he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers disease.\n\n\"Its been such a happy house  always filled with good times,\" said Nassar. \"I would hope that others would find the happiness and joy Ive found through the years with my family.\"\n\nAlthough the home drew attention, it appeared that Nassar was unable to sell it, and the listing was removed in 2019. Zillow records show it was re-listed in 2021 but did not sell until last year.\n\nMarc Gregor\n\nNassar took out a nearly $300,000 reverse mortgage loan in 2015, according to the Detroit Free Press. Court records show a complaint was filed against Nassar in June this year by Mortgage Assets Management, a financial services company.\n\nHe had a court date in the case on June 16, the day the home was on fire, and he failed to appear. Nassar also failed to appear on June 30, presumably because he was in jail.\n\nA default judgment was entered on that day, and the case was closed, according to the case docket."

        "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  Israel's military launched airstrikes early Monday targeting ports and facilities held by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who responded with missile fire targeting Israel.\n\nThe strikes came after the Houthis attacked a Liberian-flagged ship in the Red Sea that caught fire and took on water, later forcing its crew to abandon the vessel. On Monday afternoon, the claimed the attack, which saw missiles and explosive-carrying drone boats set the vessel ablaze in the Red Sea.\n\nThe Magic Seas attack raised fears of a renewed Houthi campaign against shipping that could again draw in U.S. and Western forces to the area, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.\n\nThe ship attack comes at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance, and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most sensitive atomic sites during an Israeli war against the Islamic Republic.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also was traveling to Washington to meet with Trump.\n\nIsraeli strikes target Houthi-held ports\n\nThe Israeli military said that it struck Houthi-held ports at Hodeida, Ras Isa and Salif, as well as the Ras Kanatib power plant. It released footage showing an F-16 launching from Israel for the strike, which came after the Israeli military issued a warning for the area.\n\n\"These ports are used by the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons from the Iranian regime, which are employed to carry out terrorist operations against the state of Israel and its allies,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nA sunken vessel at a site hit by Israeli forces in the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeida on the Red Sea in December. AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Israeli military also said it struck the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle-carrying vessel that the Houthis seized back in November 2023 when they began their attacks in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Houthi forces installed a radar system on the ship and have been using it to track vessels in the international maritime arena to facilitate further terrorist activities,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nThe Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader was affiliated with an Israeli billionaire. It said that no Israelis were on board. The ship had been operated by a Japanese firm, NYK Line.\n\nGalaxy Leader in May 2024. AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Houthis acknowledged the strikes, but offered no damage assessment from the attack. Their military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, claimed its air defense forces \"effectively confronted\" the Israelis without offering evidence.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly attacked Houthi areas in Yemen, including a naval strike in June. Both Israel and the United States have struck ports in the area in the past  including an American attack that killed 74 people in April  but Israel is now acting alone in attacking the rebels as they continue to fire missiles at Israel.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened to launch further strikes.\n\n\"What's true for Iran is true for Yemen,\" Katz said in a statement. \"Anyone who raises a hand against Israel will have it cut off. The Houthis will continue to pay a heavy price for their actions.\"\n\nThe Houthis then responded with an apparent missile attack on Israel. The Israeli military said that it attempted to intercept the two missiles launched by the Houthis, but they appeared to make impact, though no injuries have been reported. Sirens sounded in the West Bank and along the Dead Sea.\n\nSaree on Monday claimed to launch missiles and drones targeting Israel in its attack.\n\n\"We are fully prepared for a sustained and prolonged confrontation, to confront hostile warplanes and to counter attempts to break the naval blockade imposed by our armed forces on the enemy,\" Saree said.\n\nShip attack forces crew to abandon vessel\n\nThe attack on the Magic Seas, a bulk carrier heading north to Egypt's Suez Canal, happened about 60 miles southwest of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the Houthis.\n\nThe British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, or UKMTO, center first said that an armed security team on the vessel had returned fire against an initial attack of gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades, though the vessel later was struck by projectiles.\n\nAmbrey, a private maritime security firm, said that the Magic Seas also had been attacked by bomb-carrying drone boats, which could be a major escalation. It said that two drone boats struck the ship, while another two had been destroyed by the armed guards on board.\n\nUKMTO said the ship was taking on water and its crew had abandoned the vessel. They were rescued by a passing ship, it added.\n\nA European Union anti-piracy patrol in the region, called Operation Atalanta, said that 22 mariners had been on board the Magic Seas.\n\nSaree, the Houthi spokesman, claimed the attack and said the rebels used missiles and bomb-carrying drone boats to attack the ship.\n\n\"Our operations continue in targeting the depths of the Israeli entity in occupied Palestine, as well as preventing Israeli maritime navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas ... until the aggression on Gaza stops and the siege on it is lifted,\" Saree said.\n\nThe Magic Seas' owners didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nHouthi attacks came over the Israel-Hamas war\n\nThe Houthi rebels have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBetween November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. Their campaign has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.\n\nThe Houthis paused attacks until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis haven't attacked a vessel, though they have continued occasional missile attacks targeting Israel."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "In the year since the U.S. Supreme Court made it easier for cities to remove homeless encampments, California cities have redoubled enforcement efforts.\n\nThe court ruled last June in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson that it was not cruel and unusual punishment to outlaw camping in public spaces. Over the past year, cities have removed makeshift shelters from sidewalks and city parks, regardless of whether they have shelter beds available. Complicating matters, the state of California is facing a $12 billion deficit. Last year it allocated $1 billion toward helping cities house homeless residents. This year, lawmakers have zeroed out the main source of funding in the budget.\n\nFor people caught up in sweeps in cities like Berkeley, Oakland, and Vallejo, the same question echoes again and again: Where do I go now?\n\nWhy We Wrote This The Supreme Court ruled on June 28, 2024, that banning camping for homeless people did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In the year since, Californias cities and its homeless population have navigated a new legal landscape.\n\nFor now, Evelyn Davis Alfred doesnt have to go anywhere.\n\nOn a patch of vacant city-owned land in Vallejo, Ms. Alfred waters the succulents outside her tent shelter as neighbors come to greet her with groceries and more plants.\n\nOver the course of two years, Ms. Alfred built a shelter she calls her bungalow, complete with a shower, raised bed, and front yard. Shes beloved by her neighbors and says her bungalow offers a sense of security while she waits for permanent housing. She has applied to 19 places and has been waiting almost two years for an opening.\n\nShe had a mailbox, too, until the city came to evict her last October. Like many cities, Vallejo has a long-standing ban on camping on public land.\n\nI got a notice that I had 72 hours, but they came before then, says Ms. Alfred through tears, outside her bungalow. They wanted me to pack up everything and move, and I couldnt do that. Theres no way, not in my condition.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Evelyn Davis Alfred has lived in this tent in Vallejo, California, for two years. She has sued the city to remain under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the 14th Amendment.\n\nHer eviction came months after the June 28, 2024, Supreme Court ruling. Ms. Alfred, an older woman who is disabled, couldnt leave.\n\nTheres been more enforcement than ever since they made this rule that we cant camp anywhere, Ms. Alfred says. Where do they want us to go? Theres nowhere to go.\n\nSo she sued. And in February, a district court judge blocked the city from dismantling her bungalow until her case is resolved, citing concerns about her safety.\n\nMs. Alfreds lawyers claim the city of Vallejo violated her rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the 14th Amendments state-created danger doctrine. Ms. Alfred is represented by Where Do We Go Berkeley, a nonprofit that offers free legal defense and legal aid all over California. The judge sided with Ms. Alfred, writing that if the city knowingly put her in danger, that could violate her right to due process protections.\n\nThe 14th Amendment prohibits states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The state-created danger doctrine is a legal principle under that amendment, arguing that the states actions, in creating or increasing a danger, violate this right.\n\nMs. Alfreds advocates say her case represents a new legal foothold for homeless people and their advocates after the Supreme Courts 6-3 decision last summer.\n\nThere have been more lawsuits challenging sweeps under the Americans with Disabilities Act and both the Fifth and 14th Amendments, says Laura Riley, a University of California, Berkeley law professor.\n\nTheres a tendency to forget that these laws and these legal protections apply to everyone, including people who are unhoused, says Professor Riley. Almost 50% of people experiencing homelessness live with some type of disability, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A sign is shown outside Evelyn Davis Alfred's tent home.\n\nAs Ms. Alfreds case awaits a hearing, Ms. Riley says a verdict would give the legal community some insight into whether courts are receptive to other approaches outside of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nPreviously, advocates used the Eighth Amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Since the Grants Pass decision, 42 California cities and two counties have passed some version of a public camping ban, according to the National Homelessness Law Center. Most prohibit sleeping or storing property on public land, and carry fines or jail time.\n\nVallejo City Manager Andrew Murray says the citys approach to encampment sweeps is evolving.\n\nWere kind of driving the car while fixing it, too. We have no other choice, he says, adding that in addition to pausing sweeps, the city hired a consultant to help develop a long-term strategy.\n\nProviding housing to the unhoused is not a traditional municipal function, Mr. Murray says. Cities in particular are in a challenging position because theyre not traditionally responsible for these types of social and health issues.\n\nThe citys two main housing projects for homeless people  a new 125-bed shelter and a 47-unit permanent housing complex Mr. Murray says is due to open later this summer  met with delays and increased expenditures. The new Navigation Center, a one-stop shop for services and case management that opened this month, took nearly a decade to complete.\n\nWere in the same position as many other communities, Mr. Murray says. We all have a role to play. But there certainly needs to be a multilevel commitment and effort because cities alone dont have the resources.\n\nNo more excuses\n\nHomelessness in the Golden State reached a record high of 187,000 people in 2024, driven by rising rents, stagnant wages, and a severe housing shortage.\n\nIn May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom urged cities to ban camping without delay. No more excuses, he said at a news conference that also announced $3.3 billion in funds to help house people. It is time to take back the streets. Its time to take back the sidewalks.\n\nHis proposed model ordinance bans staying in one spot for more than three nights, building makeshift shelters, and obstructing sidewalks.\n\nDr. Margot Kushel, director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco, appreciates the boost in state funds for housing but remains skeptical of the governors model ordinance.\n\nThe biggest problem with criminalization is not a moral problem. ... Its just purely that criminalization worsens homelessness, says Dr. Kushel.\n\nEncampment sweeps often harm residents health, disrupt access to services, and derail progress toward stable housing, according to the National Health Care for the Homeless Council.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2024, the state spent $24 billion to reduce homelessness. During that time, the number of people without housing grew by 30,000. A 2024 state audit found that Californias efforts were undercut by poor coordination. The California Interagency Council on Homelessness failed to track costs and outcomes after 2021, and progress remains difficult to measure.\n\nThe public should hold those policymakers accountable and say, Why are you taking expensive efforts to worsen a problem? says Dr. Kushel. This problem is 40 years in the making.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Kimberly Griffith was evicted from her tent home on East 12th Street, where she was living for about seven months, in Oakland, California. When the city came to sweep the area, she thought she was getting housed, as she had signed up to get housed. But her name wasn't on the list.\n\nWhat happens after a sweep\n\nIn Oakland, where homelessness remains a highly visible crisis, state-funded efforts to move people from large encampments into hotel shelters show some progress. The citys most recent homeless census counted 5,485 homeless residents in 2024  about 67% of them unsheltered.\n\nAt a recently cleared encampment on East 12th Street, Trey Torres and Kimberly Griffith pack their belongings into a collapsible camping wagon, not knowing where they would sleep that night. They had lived there for months and thought help had arrived when outreach teams showed up.\n\nThe day they came, I thought we were getting housed, says Mr. Torres. Instead, he was given less than 30 minutes to leave.\n\nMost at the site, which housed 70, were relocated to a hotel shelter. Mr. Torres and Ms. Griffith say they werent accepted and dont know why.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Huy Pham, who has been homeless since 1995, sits on the land where he used to live on East 12th Street before it was cleared by the city in Oakland, California. Mr. Pham signed up for the citys hotel shelter, but when he arrived, his name wasnt on the list.\n\nImagine having to move 200 feet every three days, 100 times a year, because youre poor, says Professor Riley, assistant dean of clinical education at Berkeley Law, referring to the states model ordinance. Constant displacement is no recipe for compassion.\n\nShe says theres little to suggest that punitive measures reduce homelessness  they merely push it out of public view. As California ramps up enforcement, she worries that it may redirect funding from permanent housing toward more temporary shelters or even the criminal justice system.\n\nWith growing pressure to clean up encampments, cities risk swapping long-term solutions for short-term optics, she says.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Activist Yesica Prado checks in with homeless people living in Ohlone Park in Berkeley, California. Ms. Prado is homeless herself. She is also the founder of the Berkeley Homeless Union and brought a lawsuit against the city.\n\nTorn between safety and compassion\n\nIn Berkeley, the balancing act between safety and compassion plays out daily at Ohlone Park.\n\nNicholas Alexander walks his dog through the park most mornings. Lately, it has felt less like a neighborhood refuge and more like a public health concern.\n\nOnce called Everybodys Park, the five-block greenway was renamed in the 1970s to honor the Indigenous Ohlone people. Today, it has become a flash point in the debate over homelessness.\n\nOver the past six months, at least 40 people have set up tents, angering neighbors who are fed up with daily disruptions such as shouting matches, open drug use, and off-leash dogs. They say their repeated calls to the city have gone unanswered.\n\nThis camp needs to be swept because the entire Ohlone Park has changed for the worse, says Mr. Alexander, standing beside the chain-link fence dividing the encampment from the dog park. Were not anti-homeless  were anti this behavior, pointing to three unleashed dogs that had just chased a runner and two Monitor journalists.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Nicholas Alexander, with his dog, Hera, is part of the Save Ohlone Park group, in Berkeley, California. He was formerly homeless himself.\n\nMr. Alexander, who himself was formerly homeless and lived at an encampment, says Ohlone Park is getting worse by the day.\n\nThe difference is, we had a stronger sense of community and roles, he says of his time being homeless more than 10 years ago, when he helped feed dozens of residents. This camp has none of that.\n\nHes part of Save Ohlone Park, a group pushing for more shelter options and safety measures. But some neighbors say they have grown too exhausted for long-term fixes, willing to accept short-term solutions if it means the park feels safe again.\n\nI get that there arent any good solutions, says Mr. Alexander. But at what point do behaviors get so bad that we can sweep without offering resources?\n\nRoderick Simpson lives in a tent nearby and knows neighbors want the encampment gone. He thinks its ironic how quickly people forget that homelessness is rarely a choice.\n\nThat guy was homeless, too. Now he yells at us from the dog park, Mr. Simpson says of Mr. Alexander.\n\nMr. Simpson shares the neighbors concerns about the disorder, but says Berkeleys sweeps have forced too many people with different needs to Ohlone.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Local residents attend a town meeting about the homeless encampment in Ohlone Park in Berkeley, California.\n\nIt just makes everybody else look bad, he says. Theres a lot of us here that actually work or are trying to figure it out.\n\nAt a crowded community meeting in May, City Manager Paul Buddenhagen called homelessness the single hardest issue the city faces. Its a humanitarian crisis, but its also impacting everyone.\n\nThe city posted eviction notices at Ohlone Park. But another lawsuit  this one from the Berkeley Homeless Union  threatens to stall the sweep. It would be the seventh time Berkeley has been sued over an encampment closure.\n\nBerkeley officials say lawsuits have become expected in encampment clearings. Still, they say theyre not just shifting tents.\n\nWere not interested in kicking encampments from one street corner to the next, said Peter Radu, manager of the citys Neighborhood Services Division. That doesnt solve the problem. It just recycles it.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff An eviction notice is posted on a tent at a homeless encampment in Ohlone Park in Berkeley, California. The city planned on sweeping the area at the end of May.\n\nSince 2021, Berkeley has reduced unsheltered homelessness by 45%, one of the steepest declines in the Bay Area. The city spent over $80 million in local and state funds to add 164 units of permanent and interim housing. Nearly two-thirds of those contacted by the citys Homeless Response Team have moved into housing. But local funding approved by voters is drying up.\n\nWe just dont have the funds to keep the lights on, let alone expand, said Mr. Radu, who is also pushing for more local control over who gets housed. At the Step Up Housing site  82% funded by Berkeley  the county decides who gets in. We have no say, he says.\n\nHe also noted the city of 118,000 is carrying a regional weight. Only 57% of those surveyed in Berkeleys homeless census were last housed in Alameda County. Were shouldering more than our share, says Mr. Radu.\n\nHe believes the citys model is effective, if it can survive the budget cliff.\n\nWhat were doing works, says Mr. Radu. We just need a way to keep doing more of it."

        "content": "CNN \n\nTwo Russian men who claim to be former Wagner Group commanders have told a human rights activist that they killed children and civilians during their time in Ukraine.\n\nThe claims were made in video interviews with Gulagu.net, a human rights organization targeting corruption and torture in Russia.\n\nIn the video interviews posted online, former Russian convicts Azamat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev  who were both pardoned by Russian presidential decrees last year, according to Gulagu.net  described their actions in Ukraine, during Russias invasion.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify their claims or identities in the videos but has obtained Russian penal documents showing they were released on presidential pardon in September and August of 2022.\n\nUldarov, who appears to have been drinking, details how he shot and killed a five- or six-year-old girl.\n\n(It was) a management decision. I wasnt allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way, he said.\n\nAccording to Gulagu.net, the testimonies were given to founder and Russian dissident Vladimir Osechkin over the span of a week. It said Uldarov and Savichev were in Russia when they spoke.\n\nI want Russia and other nations to know the truth. I dont want war and bloodshed. You see Im holding a cigarette in this hand. I followed orders with this hand and killed children, Uldarov said, describing his motivation for the interview.\n\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private mercenary organization fighting in Ukraine, headed by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nIt has recruited tens of thousands of fighters from Russian jails, offering freedom and cash after a six-month tour. Its estimated by Western intelligence officials and prison advocacy groups that between 40,000 and 50,000 men were recruited.\n\nUldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Soledar and Bakhmut  which have seen some of the fiercest fighting  Wagner mercenaries were given the command to annihilate everyone.\n\nThere is a superior over all the commanders  its Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone, he added. CNN has previously reported on former Wagner fighters making similar claims.\n\nUldarov has since appeared to recant his account in a video call with Prigozhin-linked Russian news agency RIA-FAN.\n\nAt one point in the interview, Savichev described how they got the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.\n\nHe also talked about getting orders to sweep a house. It doesnt matter whether there is a civilian there or not. The house needs to be swept. I didnt give a f**k who was inside, he said.\n\nWhether a hut or a house, the point was to make sure that there wasnt a single living person left inside, he said. You can condemn me for this. I will not object. Its your right. But I wanted to live, too.\n\nSavichev said Wagner fighters who did not follow orders were killed.\n\nWagner Group chief Prigozhin confirmed on his Telegram channel that he had watched parts of the video, and threatened retribution against the two former Wagner fighters. As for what (Osechkin) filmed, I looked at the pieces of video I managed to see, he said. I can say the following: if at least one of these accusations against me is confirmed, I am ready to be held accountable according to any laws.\n\nBut Prigozhin said that if none is confirmed, I will send a list of 30-40 people who are spitting at me like Osechkin (there is a whole list of them, including the scum that fled Russia) that the Prosecutor Generals Office of Ukraine is obligated to hand over to me for a fair trial, so to speak.\n\nThey will not be civilians for us, and especially not children, whom we have never touched and do not touch. This is a flagrant lie. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.\n\nEarlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: Regarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.\n\nAndriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidents office, said in a tweet Monday that the group must be held accountable.\n\nRussian terrorists confessed to numerous murders of Ukrainian children in Bakhmut and Soledar. Confession is not enough. There must be a punishment. Tough and fair. And it will definitely be. How many more crimes like these have been committed? he said.\n\nIn February, CNN spoke to two former Wagner fighters who described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges. Deserters, or those who refuse orders are killed and there was no evacuation of the wounded, they said.\n\nIn January, US Treasury Department designated Wagner Group as a significant transnational criminal organization, and imposed a slew of fresh sanctions on a transnational network that supports it.\n\nThe US Department of State concurrently announced a number of sanctions meant to target a range of Wagners key infrastructure  including an aviation firm used by Wagner, a Wagner propaganda organization, and Wagner front companies, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken."

        "content": "The sleepaway camp where my ten-year-old daughter will live for a month this summer forbids phone calls for the first six days, except for emergencies. Then the kids get one brief call at an appointed time, once a week. Thats also about how often the camp sends photos, in which your child may or may not appear. (I comb through these like theyre a lost roll from Dealey Plaza: theres Badge Man, theres Babushka Lady, theres my kid.) No personal devicescellphones, iPads, G.P.S. trackersare allowed. Instead, my daughter and I exchange handwritten letters. Last year, I had started to think she was having too much fun to write home, but, in fact, shed written five letters in seven days, and they all arrived at once.\n\nIm grateful for our camps restrictive communication policies, and I know that many other sleepaway camps take a similar approach. Kids should be free to throw themselves into the stuff of campswimming, hiking, crafts, singalongs, stage performances, playing froccerwithout getting tangled up in the tethers of home. Sleepaway camp ideally feels like a world unto itself, a secret witchy ritual in the woods, at once wild and self-contained. By the time kids are old enough to take part, parents have had years of practice entrusting them to sitters, teachers, and other caregivers for many of their waking hours; entrusting those kids to what amounts to a temporary society unto itself is a big but logical next step. And although a parent may feel guilty or uncomfortable admitting it, its nice to cede all control of the child-rearing job for a few weeks, to have the chance to miss your kid. Its nice, once in a while, not to have to think about her at all."

Larson in a statement. \"This was an ambush on federal and local law enforcement officers.\"\n\n\"Those who use violence against law enforcement officers will be found and prosecuted using the toughest criminal statutes and penalties available,\" Larson said.\n\nShortly after, an Alvarado police officer arrived at the detention center in response to a 911 call and was shot in the neck by one of the individuals. Another assailant shot approximately 20 to 30 rounds at the unarmed correctional officers who were also present, according to the complaint.\n\nThe individuals fled the scene but were later apprehended, including Bradford Morris, who was taken into custody during a traffic stop. When Morris was detained, an officer discovered multiple firearms, including two AR-15-style rifles, ballistic vests, and a helmet in Morris's car, the complaint states.\n\n\"Morris admitted that he had been at the Prairieland Detention Center and claimed that he met some people online and transported some of them down from Dallas to the Prairieland Detention Center to make some noise,\" court records showed.\n\nAuthorities later detained the other defendants, who were dressed in black, military-style clothing, on foot, the complaint states. Additional firearms, magazines containing ammunition, radios, and 12 sets of body armor were allegedly found during a search of vehicles and the assailants.\n\nOne of the individuals had a backpack containing spray paint and flyers that said \"Fight ICE terror with class war\" and \"Free all political prisoners,\" the complaint states.\n\nViolence, threats of violence, and attempts of vandalism at our ICE Facilities will not deter our officers at ICE from fulfilling their duties, said Josh Johnson, acting ERO Dallas field office director.\n\nJohnson added, \"This type of vigilante lawlessness is emblematic of the dangers federal, state, and local law enforcement officials face every day.\"\n\nNo employees at the Prairieland Detention Center were harmed during the incident. The officer who was shot in the neck has been treated and has since been released from the hospital, the U.S. Attorney's Office confirmed to NBC News.\n\nNBC News was unable to reach the defendants for comment, and they have yet to be assigned attorneys."

        "content": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday there would be no extensions granted to the new Aug. 1 deadline he set Monday for U.S. trading partners to negotiate new deals or face significantly higher tariffs on goods imported from their countries.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump wrote:\n\nAs per letters sent to various countries yesterday, in addition to letters that will be sent today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time, TARIFFS WILL START BEING PAID ON AUGUST 1, 2025. There has been no change to this date, and there will be no change. In other words, all money will be due and payable starting AUGUST 1, 2025  No extensions will be granted. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\n\nStocks, already on edge after Trump began sending out warning letters Monday, fell meaningfully into the red after the post went live, though returned to nearly flat on the day shortly after noon Tuesday.\n\nIn remarks to reporters around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, Trump clarified, We can do things over the years, too.  Were not hard-line.\n\nHe also appeared to backpedal on announcing deals that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday would materialize in 48 hours.\n\nThe deals are mostly my deal to them, Trump said. Were picking a number thats low.\n\nIn a note to clients published shortly before Trumps midday remarks, titled Markets are (probably) right to ignore Trumps latest tariff flip-flop, Capital Economics Deputy Chief Markets Economist Jonas Goltermann wrote that his group ultimately expects U.S effective tariff rates to remain around their current levels.\n\nWhile continued noise around tariffs could well generate some volatility in the near term, we think the bar for another major sell-off remains quite high, he said.\n\nTrump announced the new deadline while publishing more than a dozen letters warning countries their goods would be subject to tariff levels close to the eye-watering ones he laid out in his shock Liberation Day speech in April.\n\nThe tariff rollercoaster ride continues, ING analysts wrote in a note Monday. While the letters leave some more room for continued frontloading  although shipping times need to be considered  and negotiations, they also mean that the tariff saga continues.\n\nThe ongoing uncertainty could do almost as much economic harm as actual tariffs, they added.\n\nOther Wall Street analysts estimated that the tariff rates contained in the 14 letters sent out so far could add slightly to consumer inflation, even though many of the recipients are small trading partners.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab noted that the letters sent Monday would hike the effective tariff rate on U.S. consumers to the highest since 1934.\n\nBank of America analysts said in a note that they dont think the tariffs announced on Monday are a done deal, adding that  despite Trumps assertions  they view the deadline extension to Aug. 1 as a suggestion that there is still room for negotiation.\n\nWith passage of his controversial tax cut and spending bill now behind him, Trump is once again stoking the fires of his trade war. He remains fixated on closing the U.S.s trade gap  or the difference in how much America imports versus how much it exports  with other nations.\n\nIts a preoccupation many economists dismiss as simplistic, since it merely reflects the fact that the U.S. is a large, advanced economy that no longer needs to produce goods, from clothing to school supplies, that can be made more cost-effectively elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, the economies of the smaller nations that the U.S. relies on to supply it with those lower-cost goods stand to be devastated by any changes to trade flows.\n\nNations around the world have responded by signaling resistance to the latest round of Trumps threats. Chinese state media warned the Trump administration Tuesday against striking deals that sideline China, especially tariffs on transshipments aimed at circumventing Chinas duties. Meanwhile, Germanys finance minister warned that the European Union would impose retaliatory measures on U.S. goods if a fair deal does not materialize.\n\nWe want an agreement with the Americans, but I also say very clearly that this deal must be fair, Lars Klingbeil told German parliament members Tuesday. And if we do not succeed in reaching a fair deal with the United States, then the European Union will have to take countermeasures to protect our economy."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "American sports come with implied narratives. The story of baseball is fundamentally nostalgic, connecting us to childhood and to the countrys pastoral beginnings. Football tells a story of manly grit, with echoes of the battlefield. Basketball is the city game, as the sportswriter Pete Axthelm called it half a century ago, and its chief narrative, for decades, was about escaping the ghetto. Religious metaphors run hotter in basketball than in other sports: when Spike Lee set out to make an ode to New York City hoops, he named his protagonist Jesus Shuttlesworth, for the N.B.A. Hall of Famer Earl (Jesus) Monroe; LeBron James appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated at the age of seventeen as The Chosen One. Every tall and prodigiously skilled teen-ager feels like an act of God. And no sport, perhaps other than soccer, with its pibes and craquesthe impoverished dribbling and juggling machines who hope to become the next Maradona or Pelso deeply mythologizes the search for talent. The savior of your N.B.A. franchise might be getting left off his high-school team in Wilmington, North Carolina, or he might be selling sunglasses on the streets of Athens, Greece, to help his Nigerian immigrant parents make ends meet, or he might be living with his mother in a one-bedroom apartment in Akron, Ohio. You just have to find him.\n\nAt least, that was the story. On a recent episode of Mind the Game, the podcast that LeBron James hosts with the coach and former point guard Steve Nash, James spoke with the young N.B.A. superstar Luka Doni about how different Jamess hoops upbringing had been from that of kids today. On the playgrounds of Akron, James said, he would play 21, in which the person with the ball tries to score against everyone else. Such games taught him how to improvise, how to get around multiple defenders and create scoring opportunities out of nothing. James is a father of two sons, who mostly learned how to play basketball indoors, in a programmed environment, he said. They were taught the game by a fleet of coaches and other professionals. I didnt have a basketball trainer until second, third, maybe fourth year in the N.B.A., James went on. My basketball training was just being on the court. Last year, Doni founded a nonprofit that focusses on youth basketball; in December, the organization published a report arguing that, as youth sports have professionalized, they have become more exclusive, sucking the joy out of the game.\n\nA video clip of the podcast was posted on TikTok, and the top comment beneath it reads, Lebron will be one of the last superstars thats from the ghetto, basketballs like golf now its a tutelage sport. That might not be entirely true; if a seven-foot-two teen-age Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were walking around any neighborhood in New York today, he wouldnt get far without a wannabe agent stopping him in the street. But, putting aside such once-in-a-generation talents, the landscape of the league has subtly changed. James and his older son, LeBron (Bronny) James, Jr., made N.B.A. history last year by suiting up as teammates, for the Los Angeles Lakers. And, while that was a first, being a second-generation N.B.A. player is becoming almost unremarkable. In 2009, ten players in the league had fathers whod played for N.B.A. teams; this past season, there were thirty-five. The future promises even more hoop legacies. The likely No. 2 pick in the upcoming draft is Dylan Harper, whose father, Ron, played with Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls. Lists of top high-school recruits include the names Anthony, as in Carmelo, and Arenas, as in Gilbert. Jamess younger son, Bryce, has committed to play for the University of Arizona and could also reach the N.B.A. soon.\n\nGenetics is the most obvious explanation: if your dad is six feet eight and your mom is six feet two, you stand a better chance of guarding Kevin Durantor Durants kidsthan my children will ever have. But the N.B.A. has been around for almost eighty years, and the number of roster spots in the league has barely changed since the mid-nineties. If all that mattered were good genes, the influx of second-generation players would have shown up thirty years ago. Why the spike now?\n\nTo answer that question, one N.B.A. executive told me, you probably have to look at the economy of basketball development. The children of pros are generally wealthy and well connected; they have access to better training, coaching, and the right people who can put them on the right lists, the executive said. Those early edges accumulate. Increasingly, players are made as much as they are born, and making those players costs money. A star prospect requires a set of physical gifts that might as well be divine in origin. But, to compete now, he will also likely need the kinds of resources that you have to buy, and a small industry has arisen to sell them.\n\nIts getting too expensive for some kids to even play, and the pressure to be perfect takes away the love for the game, Doni told me. I think about my daughter and wonder what sports will feel like for her one day. Jay Williams, a basketball analyst at ESPN who was the second pick in the 2002 N.B.A. draft, said to me, When I came into the league in the early two-thousands, player development was mostly raw talent, repetition, and survival. Now, he said, development starts younger, its more specialized, and its driven by business. Jermaine ONeal, a six-time N.B.A. All-Star who recently founded a basketball-centered prep school, told me, The cost of everything has changed. ONeal, like James, grew up with a single mother in a working-class area of a small city. Sports in general, ONeal said, are pricing out a percentage of athletes raised in communities like mine.\n\nThe professionalization of youth sports has changed not only who reaches the N.B.A. but how the game is played when they get there. Watching the post-season this year, I found the level of play to be possibly higher than ever. But I felt little emotional connection to the game. Like many fans, I complain about the number of three-point shots that teams are taking, which turns so many games into an almost cynical exercise in playing the odds. Todays style is also more rehearsed, more optimized. This, I believe, can be traced to the way that the players are learning the game from an early ageto the difference between a childhood spent outdoors with your friends, competing against grown men, and one spent as a customer, with a cadre of coaches who push you only in the ways that you or, in most cases, your parents approve of.\n\nWhat used to be driven by someones hunger to improve, to figure it out and work to get better, becomes a job for a lot of these kids so early, Steve Nash told me. This, he added, meant essentially trading their enjoyment and motivation for a calculated approach that may be more suitable to young adults than young kids.\n\nYou know that stupid thing that you said at a party when you were in your twenties that you thought made everybody hate you and it kept you up at night for years after? You were right to be concerned. Cartoon by Ivan Ehlers Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nDoes this shift also help explain why the N.B.A. has struggled to find its next superstars, successors to James, Steph Curry, and others of their generation? Perhaps. Its true that a number of todays best playersDoni, Nikola Joki, Giannis Antetokounmpoare from other countries, and many Americans crave homegrown heroes. But the leading players in this years finals, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, of the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Tyrese Haliburton, of the Indiana Pacers, are North American. (Gilgeous-Alexander is from Canada.) The former plays a throwback game that involves a lot of slithering through tight spaces; the latter makes surprising, lightning-quick passes and fires his jump shots with an awkward motion that resembles an old man pushing his grandchild on a swing. Yet neither player has caught the public imagination in the manner of a James or a Curry or a Durant. When fans argue about the next face of the league, they usually bring up Anthony Edwards, the charismatic guard on the Minnesota Timberwolves, or Ja Morant, of the Memphis Grizzlies, who floats through the air like his bones are hollow before exploding into some of the most violent dunks the league has ever seen. They are the basketball equivalents of James Brown: undeniably virtuosic, always on point, but with so much confidence and brio that they feel unpredictable and capable of anything. The new N.B.A. archetype, in contrast, feels more like an American Idol singing machinetechnically flawless and with unlimited range, but ultimately forgettable for everyone except the vocal coaches on YouTube.\n\nWhat happened? Once, a serious basketball prospect might simply play on his local high-school team and then head off to college. Nowadays, he will likely attend multiple schools, seeking exposure, playing time, and competition. The trend began slowly, in the nineteen-eighties, when secondary schools with big-time basketball programsnotably, Oak Hill Academy, in rural Virginia, the alma mater of Rod Strickland, Anthony, and Durantbegan recruiting the countrys best players. Soon, explicitly sports-centered schools emerged. The talent agency IMG purchased the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, in Florida, and expanded it to include other sports, adding basketball in 2001. Five years later, Cliff Findlay, a Las Vegas businessman who had made his money in car dealerships, opened Findlay Prep, which was, arguably, just a basketball teama dozen or so boys from all over the world who played games around the country and took classes at a private school a few minutes away from the gym where they practiced. Findlay Prep won three national high-school titles in four years and produced eighteen N.B.A. players. It closed down, in 2019, when the nearby private school ended the partnership. Suddenly, Findlays students had nowhere to go to class.\n\nThis spring, I flew to Dallas to visit Dynamic Prep, the school that Jermaine ONeal founded in 2022. It has eleven students, all of them Division I basketball prospects. Monday through Friday, the students gather at a twenty-four-thousand-square-foot training facility just north of the city. In the morning, they sit in a classroom and take an N.C.A.A.-approved curriculum of online courses. Then they head to the gym for strength training and conditioning, before basketball practice in the afternoon.\n\nWhen I arrived, Dynamics student body was on the court. The team had recently been ranked tenth in the country by ESPN, helping it qualify as a late addition to the Chipotle Nationals, an annual tournament that unofficially crowns the countrys high-school champions. But Dynamic would face long odds against more established programs, including IMG Academy and Montverde Academy, another Florida school that consistently produces N.B.A. draft picks. And practice wasnt going well. ONeal, who is the head coach of the team in addition to being the schools founder, stood on the sidelines, his arms crossed. He is nearly seven feet tall, with a high forehead and a dimpled chin; he still appears to be more or less in playing shape. The team had been running half-court sets for nearly thirty minutes, but nobody was where he was supposed to benot even Jermaine ONeal, Jr., the teams small forward. ONeal, Sr., had spent the first half of practice quietly simmering; then one player missed a defensive rotation and asked his flummoxed coach what was wrong. Your demeanor! ONeal yelled, before ordering the player off the court. Another kid replaced him, and the ball was passed back to the top of the key. The drill began again.\n\nONeal grew up in Columbia, South Carolina, and counts thirty-two siblings among his relatives. His mother taught him almost everything; he didnt meet his father until he was thirty years old. At seventeen, just a few years after growing about nine inches in three months, he became one of the youngest players ever to reach the N.B.A. when he was drafted in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers. He was part of a generation who skipped college entirely; the sports media was largely skeptical of kids who turned down college scholarships in favor of N.B.A. dollars, and these teen-agers often found themselves competing for playing time against men more than a decade older. ONeal rode the bench for four years. But veterans on the team made sure that he understood his place on the roster and how to act like a professional. When he was traded to the Indiana Pacers, after his fourth season, he flourished.\n\nONeal credits the playgrounds of his childhood with giving him instincts on the court and helping instill the resilience to endure what felt like an ignoble start to his career. He knows that the kids he coaches arent getting that kind of real-world instruction, and so he looks for ways to simulate it. Im taking a little bit of the hardship mind-set of how I grew up, and Im bringing it to this new-school mind-set and mixing it, he told me. The teams intense practices and his focus on defense are partly meant to create an experience of adversity. He believes that his job is not only to prepare his players for what comes after Dynamic in college or in the pros but also to protect them from it. Your coaches wont love youyoure just getting them closer to another win, he yelled at one point during practice. Once you get on campus, your parents will never be able to help you."

        "content": "Citizens clash with Border Patrol agents after a traffic collision with one of their vehicles in Bell on June 20.\n\nFrom June 6 to Sunday, immigration enforcement teams arrested 1,618 immigrants for deportation in Los Angeles and surrounding regions of Southern California, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHomeland Security did not respond to requests for information on how many of those arrested had criminal histories and for a breakdown of those convictions.\n\nAs immigration arrests have occurred across Southern California, demonstrators have protested the federal governments actions and bystanders have sometimes confronted immigration officers or recorded their actions. From June 6 to Sunday, 787 people have been arrested for assault, obstruction and unlawful assembly, a Homeland Security spokesperson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFigures about the Los Angeles operation released by the White House on June 11 indicated that about one-third of those arrested up until that point had prior criminal convictions.\n\nThe area of responsibility for the Los Angeles field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement includes the L.A. metropolitan area and the Central Coast, as well as Orange County to the south, Riverside County to the east and up the coast to San Luis Obispo County.\n\nData from the first days of the Los Angeles enforcement operation show that a majority of those arrested had never been charged with or convicted of a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said Monday that 75% of nationwide arrests under the Trump administration have been of immigrants with criminal convictions or pending charges. But data published by ICE show that figure has been lower in recent weeks.\n\nNationally, the number of people arrested without criminal convictions has soared and many of those are nonviolent offenders, according to nonpublic data obtained by the Cato Institute that covers the period from Oct. 1, the start of the federal fiscal year, to June 15. The most frequent crimes are immigration and traffic offenses.\n\nSerious violent offenders account for just 7% of those in custody, according to the institute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmigration enforcement officers have recently intensified efforts to deliver on President Trumps promise of mass deportations. In California, that has meant arrests of people in courthouses, on farms and in Home Depot parking lots.\n\nBut, with a daily goal of 3,000 arrests nationwide, administration officials still complain that agents are failing to arrest enough immigrants.\n\nDemocrats and immigrant community leaders argue that agents are targeting people indiscriminately. Despite the chaotic nature of the raids and protests in Los Angeles, 1,618 arrests by Homeland Security in Southern California over more than two weeks is about 101 arrests per day  a relatively small contribution to the daily nationwide goal.\n\nPerhaps the bigger achievement than the arrests, advocates say, is the fear that those actions have stoked.\n\nTimes staff writer Rachel Uranga contributed to this report."

        "content": "Pope Leo XIV is a huge Chicago White Sox fan.\n\nIts a good thing too  otherwise the event being thrown in his honor at the teams home stadium this weekend might be a little awkward.\n\nWhile the White Sox play the Rangers in Texas on Saturday afternoon, the Archdiocese of Chicago will be at Rate Field celebrating the new leader of the Catholic Church  who was born and raised on the citys South Side  with a Mass by Chicago Archbishop Blase J. Cupich and other festivities.\n\nWhile the man once known as Robert Prevost wont be there in person, he will appear in what event organizers describe as a video message from Pope Leo XIV to the young people of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeo will also be represented in mural form. The White Sox unveiled a graphic installation featuring his likeness on a concourse wall before a May 19 game against the Seattle Mariners, less than two weeks after Leo was selected as the first U.S.-born pope. He replaced Pope Francis, who died on April 21 at age 88.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox have commemorated the fandom of Pope Leo XIV with a graphic installation at Rate Field. (Nam Y. Huh / Associated Press)\n\nThe graphic was installed next to Section 140, where Leo sat in Row 19, Seat 2 for Game 1 of the 2005 World Series between the White Sox and Houston Astros. As remarkable as it might sound, there is footage from Foxs national broadcast of that Oct. 22, that shows the man then-known as Father Bob in the stands at the stadium then-known as U.S. Cellular Field.\n\nHosting a World Series game for the first time since 1959, the White Sox led by two runs with one out in the top of the ninth inning. Chicago closer Bobby Jenks had just thrown a 95-mph fastball past Houstons Adam Everett for an 0-1 count and was preparing for his next pitch.\n\nThats when the camera panned to a nervous-looking Father Bob, who appears to be wearing a team jacket over a team jersey.\n\nBefore he became the Pope, he was cheering on the White Sox at Game 1 of the 2005 World Series on FOX  pic.twitter.com/7I3GROAXYR  FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) May 10, 2025\n\nViewers never got to see the future popes reaction to what happens next, but he must have been ecstatic as Jenks strikes out Everett in two more pitches for a 5-3 Chicago win. The White Sox would go on to sweep the Astros for their first World Series win since 1917.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was his thing. He liked to get out and go to a game once in a while, Louis Prevost told the Chicago Tribune of his brother, the future pope. Eat a hot dog. Have some pizza. Like any other guy in Chicago on the South Side.\n\nHis favorite team may have fallen on harder times since then  the White Sox are an American League-worst 23-45 and 20.5 games behind the first-place Detroit Tigers in the Central Division  but Leo is still willing to put his fandom on display for the world to see.\n\nOn Wednesday, he wore a White Sox hat along with his traditional papal cassock while blessing newly married couples in St. Peters Square outside the Vatican.\n\nKelly and Gary DeStefano, who live in Haverhill, Mass., and are Boston Red Sox fans, gave him the hat. Kelly DeStefano told Boston.com they were just trying to get the new popes attention.\n\nI just wanted to make sure everyone at home knew that we did not turn on our team, she told Boston.com. It was all in joke and good fun.\n\nChicago White Sox fans dress up like fellow White Sox fan Pope Leo XIV to watch a game against the Cubs on May 17 at Wrigley Field. (Paul Beaty / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt worked, with Boston.com reporting that Leo gave the couple a good-natured ribbing once he found out where they are from.\n\nYoure going to get in trouble for this, he told them, in a video of the meeting.\n\nDont tell anyone in Massachusetts, Kelly DeStefano replied.\n\nWhile Leo might be a little too busy to attend a game anytime soon, White Sox executive vice president, chief revenue and marketing officer Brooks Boyer said last month that the pope is welcome to return to Rate Field whenever he wants.\n\nHe has an open invite to throw out a first pitch, Boyer said. Heck, maybe well let him get an at-bat."

        "content": "The Supreme Court justices, in the just-completed term, released decisions that resulted in big wins for conservative states, religious parents and President Trump.\n\nThe Supreme Court term that ended Friday will not be remembered for blockbuster rulings like those recent years that struck down the right to abortion and college affirmative action.\n\nThe justices scaled back their docket this year and spent much of their energy focused on deciding fast-track appeals from President Trump. His administrations lawyers complained too many judges were standing in the way of Trumps agenda.\n\nOn Friday, the courts conservatives agreed to rein in district judges, a procedural victory for Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhats been missing so far, however, is a clear ruling on whether the president has abided by the law or overstepped his authority under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOn the final two days of the term, the courts conservative majority provided big wins for Republican-leaning states, religious parents and Trump.\n\nThe justices gave states more authority to prohibit medical treatments for transgender teens, to deny Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood clinics and to enforce age-verification laws for online porn sites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach came with the familiar 6-3 split, with the Republican appointees siding with the GOP-led states, while the Democratic appointees dissented.\n\nThese rulings, while significant, were something short of nationwide landmark decisions  celebrated victories for the Republican half of the nation but having no direct or immediate effect on Democratic-led states.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers are not likely to pass measures to restrict gender-affirming care or to prohibit women on Medicaid from obtaining birth control, pregnancy testing or medical screenings at a Planned Parenthood clinic.\n\nThe new decisions echoed the Dobbs ruling three years ago that struck down Roe vs. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the conservative justices noted, the decision in Dobbs vs. Jackson Womens Health did not outlaw abortion nationwide. However, it did allow conservative states to do so. Since then, 17 Republican-led states in the South and Midwest have adopted new laws to prohibit most or all abortions.\n\nOn this front, the courts decisions reflect a federalism, or states-rights style of conservatism, that was dominant in decades past under President Reagan and two of the courts conservative leaders, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day OConnor.\n\nBoth were Arizona Republicans (and in OConnors case, a former state legislator) who came to the court with that view that Washington holds too much power and wields too much control over states and local governments.\n\nWith the nation sharply divided along partisan lines, todays conservative court could be praised or defended for freeing states to make different choices on the culture wars.\n\nThe other big winner so far this year has been Trump and his broad claims of executive power.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has asserted he has total authority to run federal agencies, cut their spending and fire most of their employees, all without the approval of Congress, which created and funded the agencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has also claimed the authority to impose tariffs of any amount on any country and also change his mind a few days later.\n\nHe has dispatched National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles against the wishes of the governor and the mayor.\n\nHe has asserted he can punish universities and law firms.\n\nHe has claimed he can revise by executive order the 14th Amendment and its birthright citizenship clause.\n\nSo far, the Supreme Court has not ruled squarely on Trumps broad assertions of power. But the justices have granted a series of emergency appeals from Trumps lawyers and set aside lower court orders that blocked his initiatives from taking effect.\n\nThe theme has been that judges are out of line, not the president.\n\nFridays ruling limiting nationwide injunctions set out that view in a 26-page opinion. The conservatives agreed that some judges have overstepped their authority by ruling broadly based on a single lawsuit.\n\nThe justices have yet to rule on whether the president has overstepped his power.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett summed up the dispute in a revealing comment responding to a dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary, she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMissing from all this is the earlier strain of conservatism that opposed concentrated power in Washington  and in this instance, in one person.\n\nLast year offered a hint of what was to come. A year ago, the court ended its term by declaring the president is immune from being prosecuted for his official acts while in the White House.\n\nThat decision, in Trump vs. United States, shielded the former and soon-to-be president from the criminal law.\n\nThe Constitution does not mention any such immunity for ex-presidents charged with crimes, but Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said a shield of immunity was necessary to enable the the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution.\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has not been accused of exercising undue caution.\n\nInstead, he appears to have viewed the courts opinion as confirming his unchecked power as the nations chief executive. Trump advisors say that because the president was elected, he has a mandate and the authority to put his priorities and policies into effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Supreme Courts conservatives did not take that view when President Biden took office promising to take action on climate change and to reduce the burden of student loan debt.\n\nIn both areas, the Roberts court ruled that the Biden administration had exceeded its authority under the laws passed by Congress.\n\nAway from Washington, the most significant decision from this term may be Fridays ruling empowering parents.\n\nThe six justices on the right ruled parents have a right to remove their children from certain public school classes that offend their religious beliefs. They objected to new storybooks and lessons for young children with LGBTQ+ themes.\n\nIn recent years, the court, led by Roberts, has championed the free exercise of religion that is protected by the 1st Amendment. In a series of decisions, the court has exempted Catholic schools and charities from laws or regulations on, for example, providing contraceptives to employees.\n\nFridays ruling in a Maryland case extended that religious liberty right into the schools and ruled for Muslim and Catholic parents who objected to new LGBTQ+-themed storybooks.\n\nAt first, the school board said parents could have their young children opt out of those classes. But when too many parents took the offer, the school board rescinded it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitics Supreme Court splits 4-4, blocking first religious charter school in Oklahoma The justices announced they were split 4-4 in a test case heard last month from Oklahoma, which blocks the new Catholic charter school in the state.\n\nThe clash between progressive educators and conservative parents reached the court when the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty appealed on behalf of the parents.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the parents believed the books and stories offended their religious beliefs, and he ordered school authorities to to notify them in advance whenever one of the books in question is to be used ... and allow them to have their children excused from that instruction.\n\nThis decision may have a broader impact than any from this term because it empowers parents nationwide. But it too has limits. It does not require the schools to change their curriculum and their lessons or remove any books from the shelves.\n\nThe conservatives fell one vote short in a case that could have brought about a far-reaching change in American schools. Split 4 to 4, the justices could not rule to uphold the nations first publicly funded, church-run charter school.\n\nIn the past, Roberts had voted to allow students to use state tuition grants in religious schools, but he appeared uncertain about using tax money to operate a church-run school.\n\nBut that question is almost certain to return to the court. Barrett stepped aside from the Oklahoma case heard in April because friends and former colleagues at the Notre Dame Law School had filed the appeal. But in a future case, she could participate and cast a deciding vote."

Mark Rutte during a group photo Wednesday at the NATO summit in The Hague.\n\nPresident Trump offered robust support for Europe and a rebuke of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the NATO summit in The Hague on Wednesday, capping a visit that came as a relief to anxious allies across the continent.\n\nThe gathering was designed by NATO leadership to appease the president, and it delivered, with nearly all members of the transatlantic alliance agreeing to spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense  a historic increase that had been a priority to Trump for several years.\n\nWere with them all the way, Trump said of NATO, sitting alongside its secretary general, Mark Rutte. He later added to reporters, if I didnt stand with it, why would I be here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRutte was obsequious throughout the visit, at one point referring to Trump as a daddy disciplining childlike nations at war with one another. But addressing reporters, he defended his praise of the president as well-earned.\n\nWhen it comes to making more investments, I mean, would you ever think this would be the result of this summit, if he would not have been reelected president? Rutte said. Do you really think that seven or eight countries who said, Somewhere in the 2030s, we might make the 2%, would have all decided in the last four or five months to get to 2%? So doesnt he deserve some praise?\n\nAt the summit, the president faced repeated questioning over the success of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, which were designed to supplement an Israeli campaign to effectively end Irans uranium enrichment program. But Trump expressed confidence in the mission, stating that intelligence continues to come in supporting the conclusion that its facilities were obliterated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts been obliterated, totally obliterated, he said. Weve collected additional intelligence. Weve also spoken to people that have seen the site, and the site is obliterated.\n\nAn initial Defense Intelligence Agency report, first reported by CNN, cast doubt on that conclusion. But an Israeli official told The Times that preliminary findings from an on-the-ground assessment gives Israel confidence that the program has been set back by several years.\n\nYou can see that the intelligence was very high quality in the execution of this operation  that gives us confidence in the information we have on the different facilities, the official said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a news conference, Trump seemed to commit to enforce Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization charter, a key provision stating an attack on one member is an attack on all. In the past, Trump has cast doubt on his commitment to the pledge.\n\nAs far as Article 5, look  when I came here, I came here because it was something Im supposed to be doing, Trump said. I watched the heads of these countries get up, and the love and the passion that they showed for their country was unbelievable. Ive never seen quite anything like it. They want to protect their country, and they need the United States, and without the United States, its not going to be the same.\n\nVoices Chabria: How conflict with Iran could supercharge Trumps domestic agenda With a shaky ceasefire betwen Iran and Israel, many Americans are approaching the Fourth of July with a sense of trepidation, if not outright fear.\n\nThe visual was moving, the president said.\n\nI left here saying that these people really love their countries, he added. Its not a rip-off. And were here to help them protect their countries.\n\nTrump also gave himself praise for helping to broker ceasefires around the world  most recently between Israel and Iran, but also between Pakistan and India, as well as Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  while expressing frustration with Russias president for what he described as misguided views that have perpetuated Moscows war against Ukraine.\n\nHe described a bilateral meeting with Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, as very nice  he couldnt have been nicer, Trump said  while offering choice words for Putin, an uncharacteristic position for a president who has repeatedly referred to the Russian leader as a potential friend and partner.\n\nVladimir Putin has been more difficult, Trump said, telling one Ukrainian reporter that he is looking to provide Kyiv with Patriot missile defense batteries  long a request of the Ukrainian government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also said he was open to sending additional defense funds to Kyiv if Putin fails to make progress toward a ceasefire. As far as money going, well see what happens  theres a lot of spirit, he said.\n\nLook, Vladimir Putin really has to end that war, he added."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Measles cases in the United States are the highest theyve been since the country eliminated the disease in 2000. The U.S. has reported 1,277 cases since the start of the year, according to NBC News tally of state health department data.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. also recorded its first measles deaths in a decade: two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico. All were unvaccinated.\n\nFor the past 25 years, measles has been considered eliminated in the U.S. because it has not continuously spread over a yearlong period.\n\nThere are still periodic outbreaks, however, including one that took off in in a Mennonite community in West Texas earlier this year. Vaccination rates in Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, are particularly low: As of the 2023-24 school year, 82% of kindergarteners in the county had received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) vaccine, far below the 95% rate needed to curb spread.\n\nDr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a meeting of the CDCs vaccine advisory committee in April that measles would have to keep spreading through January 20 of next year for the U.S. to lose its elimination status.\n\nMost of the cases so far this year are linked to the Southwest outbreak  there have been more than 700 cases in Texas alone  though a number of smaller outbreaks, resulting from international travel, have been detected across the U.S.\n\nThe resurgence of measles can be attributed, in part, to declining vaccination rates both globally and nationally. During the 2023-24 school year, less than 93% of kindergartners in the U.S. received the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine, down from 95% during the 2019-20 school year.\n\nThe West Texas outbreak parallels one in 2019 among Orthodox Jewish communities in New York with low vaccination rates. The U.S. recorded 1,274 cases that year. A vaccination campaign, which included a vaccine mandate in New York City and officials administering 60,000 doses in affected communities, helped contain the spread.\n\nNew Yorks response was an incredible feat and something were obviously trying to emulate, Sugerman said. But he noted that the loss of Covid grant money has created funding limitations in Texas. The CDC slashed $11.4 billion in Covid funding last month, some of which helped state health departments respond to disease outbreaks. Each measles case may cost $30,000 to $50,000 to address, which adds up quite quickly, Sugerman said.\n\nMany disease experts have also expressed concern that the federal messaging around vaccines could make the outbreak harder to contain. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for people to get the measles vaccine, he has also framed vaccination as a personal choice, emphasized unproven treatments such as steroids or antibiotics and falsely claimed that immunity from measles vaccines wanes quickly.\n\nDr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician who treats patients in Lubbock and Gaines County, said at a press conference in April that misinformation was the biggest nemesis for health care providers. She was aware of some patients taking vitamin A instead of getting vaccinated, she said. Kennedy has played up the role of vitamin A in helping measles patients, though its unclear how beneficial it is. The CDC says vitamin A can be administered under the supervision of a health care provider, but its not a treatment for the disease.\n\nCountering the misinformation put out there about using vitamin A for treatment of measles has been a struggle, an upward struggle, Montanez said.\n\nBy contrast, two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and offer lifelong protection. The virus is particularly dangerous for babies and young children, whose immune systems arent always developed enough to fight an infection. In Texas, officials recommended an early dose for babies ages 6 to 11 months. Unvaccinated children older than 12 months old should get one dose, according to the state, then a second dose 28 days later.\n\nMeasles often starts with a high fever, cough, runny nose and pink or watery eyes. From there, patients may develop white spots on the insides of the cheeks near the molars and a blotchy rash of flat, red spots. Severe cases can progress to pneumonia or swelling of the brain.\n\nRoughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC."

        "content": "Yes, Jodie Whittaker is the perfect choice as the 13th incarnation of The Doctor, the Time Lord at the center for the long-running BBC series Doctor Who.\n\nYes, it is long past time that the series selected an actor to play The Doctor who isnt a male. Most importantly yes, she has been selected for the right reasons.\n\nThere is hard resistance and soft resistance to change. Together, they form a wall; one is simply more penetrable than the other. The nerd bros flooding the BBC with enraged sexist tweets and emails are hard resistance personified. They also show up right on cue anytime an established arena opens to players who arent white and male.\n\nSadly this is typical of sci-fi fandom especially, a space filled with people frequently marginalized for their love of genre, even now that it has been thoroughly mainstreamed; a space where stories of existences positing that literally anything is possible thrive and inspire; a space filled with stories of female characters who lead rebellions, govern interplanetary alliances and helm starships. Even now the multiple ironies of nerd misogyny are lost on its perpetuators.\n\nBut soft resistance, manifesting in the form of well-meaning fans wondering whether the BBC is shoving an actress into the role to placate a fan base that has been clamoring for a female Doctor for the better part of a decade, can be damaging in its own right. Soft resistance casts aspersions upon progress in realms real and virtual; it serves as another barrier to progress.\n\nDoctor Who is a fiction, and its hero is an extraterrestrial being with two hearts who travels through space and time in a police box (aka a phone booth), but such a reaction matters. Questioning whether this forward step is happening for the right reasons is the mealy-mouthed cousin of Its not the right time. It may be the less sinister of the two, though, because instead of leaving people with the frustrating retort of if not now, when? we get to reply, the decision has been made, so deal with it or get off the TARDIS.\n\nWhittakers assumption of the role is historic, and it also breaks a sci-fi boundary in the larger sense that the Doctor is a creature of intelligence first and above all. In science fiction and fantasy, women can have brains or brawn, but rarely both in the same package. Female logicians and scientists are usually protected by male characters. When women are endowed with physical power, its either explained as being part of a supernatural force or technological upgrade. Think River Tam of Firefly or Wonder Woman (though, for a time, Diana of Themyscira served as the Justice Leagues secretary.)\n\nWhen female characters are the muscle, their gender tends to be neutered. Vasquez or Ellen Ripley of Aliens are examples of this. The beauty of the Doctor, and Whittaker as the Doctor, is that she gets to embody supreme intelligence, gutsiness and brawn all at once and still (presumably) be female.\n\nThe Doctor is a sleuth, a bold, brave, powerful being who can only be shaken by the Universes greatest evils, and she  she!  does battle with little more than her wits and a sonic screwdriver. The Doctor fights for balance in the universe because she has offended the concept of cosmic equilibrium many, many times. She has a lot to clean up.\n\nPeople are free to wonder aloud whether awarding the role to a woman is reactive as opposed to creative. But in doing so they should also realize that they are questioning Whittakers skill and ability. In positing that her gender matters more than her appropriateness for a role, they are playing into the idea that a part that has been played by different actors since 1963, each bringing unique personality traits to the role, can only be played by a man.\n\nHeres the thing, ladies and lads  social progress is almost always reactive. This is true in political systems, its true in popular culture and its certainly true of geek culture. Star Trek zealots flipped out 22 years ago when Kate Mulgrew was cast as Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway, captain of the starship USS Voyager. Neither the world nor the Trek universe imploded, and this fall Trekkers will welcome another female Starship captain in Michelle Yeohs Philippa Georgiou, who will helm the USS Starship Shenzhou in Star Trek: Discovery on CBS and its streaming service CBS All Access.\n\nAnd the successful normalization of social progress in pop culture often forwards the cause of social change in the real world. Case in point: the rise of Rosie ODonnell and Ellen DeGeneres, then Will & Grace, all of whom brought portrayals of LGBTQ life into American homes via popular talk shows and prime time programs. Their success helped eased the path to marriage equality.\n\nWe vote our identity more than our self-interest, and when see ourselves in widely beloved film and television characters, we in turn see greater possibility for the world in general.\n\nWhovians have grown more insistent that the BBC select an actress to take control of the TARDIS since fan favorite 10th doctor David Tennant left the role behind. Tennant was capably replaced by newcomer Matt Smith  the youngest actor to assume the roleand once Smith was finished, veteran Scottish actor Peter Capaldi.\n\nWomen have always played an important role of the Doctor Who universe, but across the decades the theyve served as The Doctors platonic companions.\n\nCurrent Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat, who took over for previous executive producer Russell T. Davies in 2009, was never going to make the Doctor female. Indeed, when a campaign to cast a female Time Lord hit a fever pitch after Smith abandoned the franchise, Moffat replied by casting Capaldi  a tremendous actor, yes, but also an indulgent fantasy stand-in for a showrunner who declared himself to be a super-Whovian since he was a child.\n\nGiven Moffats dubious track record with developing female characters in general, it may be a good thing he will not be developing the franchises first female Time Lord. Moffat did, however, conceive fan favorite River Song (Alex Kingston), a human with Time Lord DNA who appears throughout the series to wreak havoc and to save the day.\n\nDuring his tenure Moffat also introduced female Time Lord characters to acknowledge the possibility of a Gallifreyan being a woman, a notion that should not be as controversial as it is. So in a sense, although he couldnt bring himself to usher a female Time Lord into the Doctor Who ecosystem while he was at the helm, Moffat deserves credit for putting the paving stones in place for the next showrunner, Chris Chibnall, to blaze that path.\n\nAnd unlike Moffat, Chibnall is the right person to shepherd a female Time Lord into existence. He worked with Whittaker on the crime drama Broadchurch, which he created; Whittaker plays Beth Latimer, mother of the first seasons young murder victim Danny. Because of her past work with Chibnall, Whittaker became an odds-on favorite to assume the mantle of the Doctor. Another was Whittakers Broadchurch co-star, Olivia Colman.\n\nBoth women are incredibly talented. Whittaker, though, traverses a wider and more extreme variety of psychological tones as Beth. Chibnall wrote this versatility into her role, and playing the Doctor, a being who vacillates between puckish playfulness, soft empathy and stern intimidation  often in the same episode  requires that level of facility with regard to emotional dexterity.\n\nLike I said before, Whittakers perfect. And yes, her arrival is overdue. Because there are so many reasons Whittakers casting as the new Doctor was the right choice for the BBC to make, but in the end, this is really why it matters.\n\nIf we want social change to be proactive, we need to seed that idea early and in the imaginations of our youngest. On TV we accept the idea that women can ride dragons, lead crews of starships to the furthest reaches of the universe and now defend time and space itself. Thats today. What else is possible for our collective tomorrow?"

Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss the presidents speech as well as what to expect from Donald Trumps inauguration.\n\nAlthough Bidens administration can claim various key moments of success over the past four years, his presidency was consciously framed around defending and protecting democratic norms, McKay Coppins said last night. But after he lost his party and the White House in a pretty dramatic fashion to usher in the return of Donald Trump, McKay continued, its going to be hard to make the case that he did what he set out to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has vowed to take dramatic steps in the earliest days of his presidency, including mass deportations. Youre going to see a flurry of executive orders, Zolan Kanno-Youngs said.

        "bias": "",
        "content": "A provision tucked inside a sweeping bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last week will make it harder for thousands of aspiring doctors to finance their education as the country faces a growing shortage in that profession.\n\nThe move will cap the amount of federal loans students can borrow for graduate school to $20,500 a year  with a total limit of $100,000  and cap loans for professional programs, such as medical, dental or law school, at $50,000 a year, with a total limit of $200,000.\n\nWhile those limits may sound like large amounts, medical school students graduate with an average of more than $264,000 in educational debt and the cost of medical school programs can exceed $300,000 at private universities, according to the Education Data Initiative. Without the ability to take out more federal loans, prospective students say they will have to turn to private loans, which can have stricter borrowing or repayment options, or potentially put off their medical school plans.\n\nI have watched a lot of students get into debt, and it is scary, but part of the medical training and the medical education system, its an expensive journey. I think that its something that the government needs to understand, said Zoe Lewczak, a 26-year-old bioethics masters student at Harvard Medical School, who is in the process of applying to 30 schools for MD-Ph.D. programs. What is currently happening, I think this is going to create a major gap in who is able to access medical education and pursue it.\n\nThe legislation, which Republicans have dubbed the one big, beautiful bill, largely focuses on providing trillions of dollars in tax cuts for businesses, increased spending for immigration enforcement and cuts to health insurance programs. But within the nearly 900-page law are several changes to student loan programs, including the elimination of a loan program put in place in 2006 called Grad PLUS, which allows students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance.\n\nThe Grad PLUS loans were initially intended to help more people attend graduate and professional programs. But opponents of the loan program have argued that it has allowed colleges and universities to increase tuition unchecked because students have been able to borrow essentially unlimited amounts of money, leaving borrowers with financially crippling levels of debt.\n\nMedical schools have warned the loan cap could discourage students from going into medicine at a time when the country is already on track to have a shortage of as many as 86,000 physicians by 2036, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The group said that medical school tuition increases have slowed since the introduction of the loan program.\n\nThis will intensify challenges for medical students to finance their education due to some of the complexities of private loans, and we believe it will result in an additional financial barrier to attending medical school, said Kristen Earle, AAMC program leader for student financial aid services. This added barrier could deter qualified candidates from pursuing a medical degree altogether, ultimately worsening the existing and expected physician shortage.\n\nThe student loan cap comes as universities are already struggling with wider funding cuts. Trump has sought to cut off various forms of federal funding for institutions that have policies with which he disagrees, and the Department of Government Efficiency has cut or frozen medical and scientific funding schools rely on.\n\nFor Lewczak, the loan cap will likely force her to find financial assistance beyond the government. At her top-choice medical school, the average student leaves with $400,000 in debt  double the loan limit that will be imposed by the bill. With the new loan cap, shes considering taking out private loans, something she thinks should be an option since she has built up good credit.\n\nThere seems to be this misconception that federal student loans are just like free handouts, and that is very much false, she said. You are signing an agreement, you are paying it back with the interest rate.\n\nWhile private loans will still be an option for some students, those loans arent eligible for public service loan forgiveness programs, like those for doctors who work in underserved communities. Private loans can also come with less flexible repayment options or require the borrower to have a co-signer, Earle said.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Lewczak created a TikTok account to help students figure out how to fund graduate school in higher education. She predicts the new law will create a gap in students who want to pursue medicine and students who can actually access that education.\n\nOther current and prospective medical school students have also taken to social media to share their concerns over the loan limit.\n\nShae-Marie Stafford-Trujillo, 23, who is completing a one-year post-bachelor certificate program at Baylor School of Medicine in Houston, said the bill is already dashing her hopes of studying at some of her top-choice medical schools, like Stanford University, where one year of attendance costs more than $150,000.\n\nYou can imagine how almost surreal it feels to not even be able to go to an institution and study that, said Stafford-Trujillo, who hopes to specialize in research around narcolepsy, a condition she has personally struggled with. Its not even across the world, its potentially only a couple of 100 miles away, but now I dont even have the opportunity to go and study at some of these institutions.\n\nUnless she gets into an MD-Ph.D. program, which could be fully paid for, Stafford-Trujillo likely will only be able to afford an in-state medical school in Texas.\n\nYou could imagine and empathize with now students are no longer able to apply broadly or to apply to programs, potentially their dream school, she said.\n\nLauren Garkow, 25, is halfway through a four-year medical school based in the Caribbean and is interested in pursuing a career in pathology when she graduates. She said her classmates have already struggled to afford even the basic necessities  a struggle she expects to get even worse if loans are limited.\n\nI really fear for all the medical students who have to deal with that new bill, she said.\n\nHealth care as a whole will be affected, she said. This is going to have a ripple effect on all of us."

        "content": "How the Irish band Kneecap went from rising hip-hop group to global lightning rod\n\ntoggle caption Leon Neal/Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n\nLONDON - When Kneecap performed at Glastonbury music festival this year  a performance that the British Prime Minister opposed before the band even took the stage  bandmember Mo Chara told the crowd, \"us three have no right to be on this stage in front of this many people, rapping predominantly in a language that even people at home don't even speak.\"\n\nKneecap, three young men from Northern Ireland who rap in Irish, has risen to prominence in recent years, with controversy surrounding its shows and political statements.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe hip-hop trio was formed in 2017, composed of bandmembers Mo Chara, Mgla Bap and DJ Prva, who come from Belfast. The band is part of the generation known as the \"ceasefire babies,\" who grew up in the aftermath of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that formally ended the decades of violence in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles. The group's lyrics span everything from working class youth culture in Belfast, to Irish language rights, to a desire for Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland.\n\nWhy the trio raps in Irish\n\nKneecap says that rapping in Irish, long marginalized under British rule in Northern Ireland, is a political choice. When NPR met the band at an Irish-language cultural center in west Belfast in 2023, bandmember Mo Chara explained, \"It's impossible not to be political here [in Northern Ireland] if you're going to speak Irish. It's very hard not to be political growing up in Belfast.\"\n\nThe Irish language  which the British banned from Northern Irish government and courts under a recently repealed 18th century law  is now seeing a revival, especially among young people. Northern Ireland has seen a steady rise in Irish speakers in recent years, and Irish was made an official language of the region in 2022, where about 12% of the population now speak it.\n\nKneecap has been credited for leading what some have called an \"Irish language revolution.\"\n\nAs well as being a political choice, the band says rapping in Irish is also a creative one. Kneecap has pushed the boundaries of the language in rap, with Mo Chara telling NPR that Irish isn't \"just about fiddles and shamrocks.\"\n\n\"Our youth culture now involves a lot more paraphernalia and drugs,\" says Mgla Bap. \"We had to create new words so that we could talk about these things. That was part of the band, creating this new vocabulary that didn't really exist.\"\n\nThe band's debut song, \"C.E.A.R.T.A,\" means \"rights\" in Irish. Kneecap says it was born out of a night when Mgla Bap and his friends were out spray-painting around Belfast during a protest in support of the Irish language. It's about the right to speak Irish, Mgla Bap says, but it's also about \"the right for us to get off our heads, to get high.\"\n\nThe band's influences are wide-ranging, from U.S. hip-hop to Irish rebel music. The members grew up listening to Irish rebel songs, says Mo Chara. \"These were songs that were about the unification of Ireland,\" he says. \"They were very anti-British involvement in Ireland.\"\n\nMo Chara cites songs like \"Come Out Ye Black and Tans\", a 1920s Irish rebel song about standing up to a notoriously brutal British police force named for the color of their uniforms, who were infamous for killing Irish civilians during the Irish War of Independence in the early 1920s. Mgla Bap says the song, \"talks about this army that came from England that went out murdering people,\" and says that \"it would be seen today to have a hip-hop theme to it.\"\n\nKneecap's own music talks about a desire for Northern Ireland to be freed from British rule, too. One of the group's biggest hits is titled \"Get Your Brits Out.\"\n\nA semi-fictionalised film about the band's origins  in which the members star as themselves  won critical acclaim and a string of awards, including a BAFTA earlier this year.\n\nYouTube\n\nHow the band has attracted controversy\n\nThe band is also vocal in its criticism of Israel, and call Israel's war in Gaza a genocide  statements that have drawn the ire of politicians and public figures in the UK and beyond.\n\nAt Coachella this year, Kneecap led the crowd in chants of \"Free Palestine\" and ended the set projecting pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel messages on the screen, including one that said \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" and, \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes.\" The set attracted criticism, with some, including Sharon Osbourne, calling for the band's U.S. visas to be revoked.\n\nSoon after the Coachella set, two older videos surfaced online from past concerts, which appeared to show band members shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\" and saying \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory,\" referring to lawmakers from Britain's center-right Conservative party. British counter-terrorism police said they were investigating the band and Mo Chara was later charged with a terrorism offence, for allegedly holding up a flag in support of Hezbollah, which is a proscribed terrorist organization in the U.K.\n\nIn a statement on X, Kneecap said: \"we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah. We condemn all attacks on civilians,\" and \"we reject any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual.\" The group said the videos had been \"taken out of all context\" and that there had been a \"smear campaign\" against the band following its Coachella performance.\n\nThe band saw some of its shows cancelled following the terror charge. Some politicians said Kneecap shouldn't be allowed to perform at Glastonbury, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer who said it would not be \"appropriate.\"\n\nIn the end, Glastonbury organizers said the Kneecap performance would go ahead. The BBC, which broadcasts the festival live every year, said it would not broadcast the Kneecap show live but later made it available to watch online. In a statement, the BBC said \"whilst the BBC doesn't ban artists, our plans ensure that our programming meets our editorial guidelines.\"\n\nThe band drew a crowd of hundreds of thousands, and it used the set to reiterate its support for Palestinians in Gaza and to hit back at the band's critics, beginning with a montage of the various condemnations Kneecap received from both sides of the Atlantic. At one point the band led the crowd in chants of \"F*** Keir Starmer\" and described the charge against Mo Chara as a \"trumped up terrorism charge.\"\n\nMo Chara drew parallels between the Irish struggle and the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, telling the crowd that, \"the Irish suffered 800 years of colonialism under the British state,\" adding, \"we understand colonialism and we understand how important it is for solidarity internationally.\"\n\nBritish police have now opened a criminal investigation into Kneecap's Glastonbury set \"relating to hate crimes,\" alongside another set by British punk band Bob Vylan, in which the lead singer, Bobby Vylan, led the crowds in chants of \"death, death to the IDF,\" referring to the Israeli military. The police have not said which part of either set would be subject to criminal investigation."

Trump and Netanyahu dined together on Monday at the White House during the Israeli leaders third US visit since the president began his second term on 20 January. Netanyahu spent much of Tuesday at the Capitol, telling reporters after a meeting with House speaker Mike Johnson that while he did not think Israels campaign in the Palestinian enclave was done, negotiators are certainly working on a ceasefire. We have still to finish the job in Gaza, release all our hostages, eliminate and destroy Hamas military and government capabilities, Netanyahu said. Netanyahus plan to return to the White House at 4:30pm ET pushed back his meeting with Senate leaders to Wednesday. Shortly after Netanyahu spoke, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff said he hoped to reach a temporary ceasefire agreement this week. We are hopeful that by the end of this week, well have an agreement that will bring us into a 60-day ceasefire. Ten live hostages will be released. Nine deceased will be released, Witkoff told reporters at a meeting of Trumps cabinet earlier.

Share Updated at 15.33 EDT\n\n42m ago 14.51 EDT Pentagon provided $2.4tn to private arms firms to fund war and weapons, report finds Andrew Roth A new study of defense department spending previewed exclusively to the Guardian shows that most of the Pentagons discretionary spending from 2020 to 2024 has gone to outside military contractors, providing a $2.4tn boon in public funds to private firms in what was described as a continuing and massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to fund war and weapons manufacturing. The report from the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and Costs of War program at Brown University said that the Trump administrations new Pentagon budget will push annual US military spending past the $1tn mark. That will deliver a projected windfall of more than half a trillion dollars that will be shared among top arms firms such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as well as a growing military tech sector with close allies in the administration such as JD Vance, the report said. The report is compiled of statistics of Pentagon spending and contracts from 2020 to 2024, during which time the top five Pentagon contractors (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman) received $771bn in contract awards. Overall, private firms received approximately 54% of the departments discretionary spending of $4.4tn over that period. Taking into account supplemental funding for the Pentagon passed by Congress under Trumps flagship sweeping tax and spending bill, the report said, the US military budget will have nearly doubled this century, increasing 99% since 2000. The US withdrawal from Afghanistan in September 2021 did not result in a peace dividend, the authors of the report wrote. Instead, President Biden requested, and Congress authorized, even higher annual budgets for the Pentagon, and President Trump is continuing that same trajectory of escalating military budgets. That contradicts early indications from Trump in February that he could cut military spending in half, adding that he would tell China and Russia that theres no reason for us to be spending almost $1tn on the military  and Im going to say we can spend this on other things. Instead, the spending bill pushed by Trump through Congress included a $157bn spending boost for the Pentagon.

The revelation was contained in court filings on Monday by lawyers for more than 100 migrants who are seeking to challenge their deportations to El Salvadors mega-prison known as Cecot. In this context, the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities, Salvadorian officials wrote in response to queries from the unit of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The UN group has been looking into the fate of the men who were sent to El Salvador from the US in mid-March, even after a federal judge had ordered the planes that were carrying them to be turned around. The Trump administration has argued that it is powerless to return the men, as they are beyond the reach of US courts and no longer have access to due process rights or other US constitutional guarantees. But lawyers for the migrants said the UN report shows otherwise. American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email: El Salvador has confirmed what we and everyone else understood: it is the United States that controls what happens to the Venezuelans languishing at Cecot. Remarkably the US government didnt provide this information to us or the court. Skye Perryman, CEO and president of Democracy Forward, said the documents show that the administration has not been honest with the court or the American people. The ACLU and Democracy Forward are both representing the migrants. A justice department spokesperson declined to comment. White House and homeland security department officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Associated Press. Share Updated at 14.40 EDT\n\n2h ago 14.00 EDT The US education secretary, Linda McMahon, yesterday threatened the state of California with legal action after the state refused to ban transgender girls from participating in girls sports as demanded by the Trump administration. @CAgovernor, youll be hearing from @AGPamBondi, McMahon wrote on X, using the handles for Californias governor, Gavin Newsom, and the US attorney general, Pam Bondi. McMahons statement was the latest salvo in the culture wars over transgender youth and ratchets up the personal rivalry between Trump and Newsom. Trump has made reversing advances in transgender rights a priority since returning to office on 20 January, while California law has allowed student athletes to participate in sports in alignment with their gender identity since 2013. The justice department declined to comment and the education department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for clarification on the meaning of McMahons comment. Californias state education department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Newsoms office and the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), the governing body for high school sports, declined to comment. The US education department issued a statement in June declaring California in violation of the Trump administrations interpretation of Title IV, the education law banning sex-based discrimination, and demanding the state alter its policy. The state rejected the federal governments directive, and in June filed a pre-enforcement lawsuit against the US justice department in anticipation of legal action. With controversy brewing ahead of the state high school track and field championship in June, the CIF allowed girls displaced from the finals by a transgender athlete to also be granted space to compete. The CIF also allowed girls to appear on the winners podium if they would have won a medal without a transgender athlete competing. As a result, the CIF crowned two champions in the girls high jump and triple jump after transgender girl AB Hernandez won both events.

Trump said his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, was in close touch with the citys mayor, Muriel Bowser, a Democrat. It is not the first time the president floated a federal takeover of the city, home to the White House, Congress and the supreme court. Trump told reporters in February: I think we should take over Washington DC  make it safe. I think that we should govern District of Columbia. Under home rule, Congress already vets all laws in the city and federal lawmakers can overturn some of them. However, it would take an act of Congress to make federal rule a reality. Both houses would have to vote to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act. It would be a controversial move and unlikely to make it through.

Trump signed an order directing the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, to start a new national security investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the same law that Trump used in his first term to impose 25% global tariffs on steel and aluminum.

        "content": "The juxtaposition at the weekend was apt: one big, ugly bill in Washington and one big, garish wedding in Venice.\n\nThis is what days of Senate debate over President Trump and Republicans nearly 1,000-page legislation had in common with the days of revelry at the $50-million nuptials of the worlds-third-richest-man, Jeff Bezos, and ever-couture-corseted Lauren Snchez: an exhibit of excess for a new Gilded Age, encapsulating the gulf between the have-nots and the have-yachts . (Venices yacht ports were reportedly all booked for the wedding, though not by Bezos own 417-foot-long Koru.)\n\nThe president was invited, natch, but he was a no-show. Consider his legislation his gift to the happy couple. Snchez and Bezos have much to love in Trumps absurdly titled One Big Beautiful Bill Act making its way through the Republican-run Congress. But Bezos Amazon employees and many of his cut-rate-shopping customers? Not so much.\n\nThis may be the most inequitable and overtly reverse-Robin Hood budget behemoth ever. It would make permanent and expand upon the deep Trump tax cuts of 2017 that disproportionately benefited the rich. The multitrillion-dollar cost would be offset by about $1 trillion in healthcare cuts, mostly to the Medicaid program that serves more than 70 million people. Other cuts would end clean-energy projects (costing jobs and ceding the alternative-energy future to China) and slash nutrition programs for the needy. Meanwhile, spending would increase roughly 15-fold for immigration enforcement, paying for purposely cruel detention centers such as Trumps new Alligator Alcatraz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBottom line: about $3.5 trillion in additional debt over just the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThis monstrosity would exacerbate what is already record income inequality in the United States. It would reverse the past decades decline, under Obamacare, in the number of Americans without health insurance, causing about 17 million people to lose coverage, according to the health-policy nonprofit KFF. More rural hospitals, reliant on Medicaid, would close. Forget the minutiae of Medicaid policy, tweeted Vice President JD Vance, supposed elegist of hillbillies and other downtrodden Americans  its the extra immigration crackdown cash that counts.\n\nVoices Contributor: Legislators should be ashamed of themselves I want tax cuts. I want spending cuts. This One Big Beautiful Bill Act has managed to mess up both and would create a more bloated government.\n\nHealthcare threats loom even as two research papers recently reported that Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion have saved the lives of many low-income adults. One study last month found that the proposed cuts could increase preventable deaths by nearly 17,000 annually. The other , in May, concluded that as much as 20% of the well-documented disparity in the lifespans of low- and high-income Americans, with the latter living longer, is attributable to the lack of health insurance among those with lower incomes.\n\nIn other words, the supposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would be a killer.\n\nThat, of course, would be the worst of it. But other descriptors are so damning that only Trumps death grip on fellow Republicans can explain why theyd vote for this politically suicidal package. With polls this bad , the 2026 midterm elections cant come soon enough to eject Republicans rubberstamping majority in Congress and check Trumps madness.\n\nThe largest upward transfer of wealth in American history, said the Atlantic of the bills particulars. The biggest cut to programs for low-income Americans ever, according to budget guru Bobby Kogan at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The most expensive piece of legislation probably since the 1960s, said analyst Jessica Riedl of the conservative Manhattan Institute,  piling trillions of new borrowing on top of deficits that are already leaping.\n\nThat pile-up couldnt happen at a worse time.\n\nFor decades, budget experts have warned of a coming fiscal tsunami by the 2020s that would swamp the economy as retiring boomers drew from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid while federal revenues were drained by tax cuts. Yet Republican presidents and Congresses kept cutting taxes and, in league with Democrats, failed to make necessary and relatively painless adjustments to the so-called entitlement benefit programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now here we are, knifing Medicaid not to make it and the overall budget more fiscally sound, but to offset the cost of more tax cuts favoring the wealthy, driving up debt.\n\nTrump, plainly peeved at talk that hell break his first-term record of the most debt in a presidential term ( $8.4 trillion ), on Wednesday whined in a post , Nobody wants to talk about GROWTH.\n\nVoices Calmes: The One Big Beautiful Bill is a big, ugly mess The Republicans tax cuts combined with their spending plans will help the rich and cost the poor, spiraling the debt and tattering the safety net for everyone.\n\nAmericans are on to this fiction that tax cuts pay for themselves. Presidents Reagan, George W. Bush and Trump 1.0 all slashed tax rates disproportionately for the rich and corporations, claiming that economic growth would help reduce deficits. They were wrong. For Trump to do it again and expect a different result, is, as the saying goes, the definition of insanity . The only recent Republican president who helped reduce deficits was George H.W. Bush because he raised taxes as part of a balanced, bipartisan package of spending cuts and tax increases  shared sacrifice, something Trump knows nothing about.\n\nJust as the Senate was ending its vote to pass Trumps bill on Tuesday, sending it back to the House, Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, was heard shouting to Republican senators as he exited, Shame on you guys.\n\nDoesnt he know by now that Trump and his party minions have no shame?\n\nIn Venice, Bezos the billionaire groom came in for some razzing too. A huge banner carpeted the famed Piazza San Marco before his three-day bacchanalia: If you can rent Venice for your wedding you can pay more tax.\n\nBezos could, but he wont. Weve gone beyond trickle-down tax politics. Its bottoms up for Bezos, other billionaires and all the mere millionaires. Well all suffer the hangover, however, and none more than the most needy among us.\n\n@Jackiekcalmes @jackiecalmes.bsky.social @jkcalmes"

TSA appears to be giving the pesky rule the boot\n\ntoggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration appears to be kicking one of the most despised rules at U.S. airport security checkpoints: removing your shoes.\n\nThe federal government began requiring airline passengers to slip off their footwear during security checks in 2006, roughly five years after British-born terrorist Richard Reid tried to detonate a bomb hidden in his shoes on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami.\n\nOn Tuesday, the rule already seemed to have ended at some airports.\n\nAn NPR reporter at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) early Tuesday observed fliers passing through multiple security checkpoints without removing their shoes. A spokesperson for the Philadelphia International Airport confirmed Tuesday morning that the TSA was permitting standard passengers to keep their footwear on during the screening process there.\n\nSome travelers also posted on social media this week that they've been able to keep their shoes on in U.S. airport security lines. \"Just went through at Buffalo, didn't take shoes off,\" one X user wrote Monday night. \"Shoes on at SeaTac (Seattle) just now,\" said another .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe TSA did not directly confirm the policy shift in a statement to NPR Tuesday morning.\n\n\"TSA and [the Department of Homeland Security] are always exploring new and innovative ways to enhance the passenger experience and our strong security posture,\" the spokesperson said. \"Any potential updates to our security process will be issued through official channels.\"\n\nThe lack of clarity about whether the policy had actually been withdrawn led to at least one confusing exchange at a New York City airport. \"I flew through LaGuardia this morning and when I went to take my shoes off the TSA agent yelled at me like I was a crazy person doing something completely unexpected,\" another X user said early Tuesday.\n\nLaverne McCartney Knighton, a Minneapolis resident whose flight landed in Washington, D.C., Tuesday morning, said she welcomed the new approach.\n\n\"As a woman, who wants to pull her shoes off? And I don't like pulling my shoes off in public places. I don't like my feet on floors that I don't know about,\" McCartney Knighton said. \"But it's faster, you know, so it's been wonderful for me.\"\n\nBianca DuBose, who was also traveling from Minneapolis, applauded the rule change but also said she remembers the airport security changes implemented after the September 11th terrorist attacks and recognizes the need for added safety measures while traveling.\n\n\"I like it, but I grew up military, so if we have to go back to it I understand why,\" DuBose said of the shoe removal rule change. \"To me, if that's the bigger issue, I'll take my shoes off any day.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer who now writes the travel newsletter Gate Access, said fliers shouldn't be concerned about the security implications of the rule reversal. He first reported the rule change Friday in his newsletter.\n\n\"Travelers should know that TSA has the technology to appropriately screen passengers with their shoes on,\" Harmon-Marshall said. \"That means they can detect anything that's harmful while you're wearing shoes.\"\n\nHe also predicted that potentially scrapping the shoe removal policy would make TSA security lines move more quickly. \"It is a hassle at times, especially with families with large groups or children that are over the age of 12,\" said Harmon-Marshall. \"Shoes can cause delays because they get stuck in the X-ray machine.\"\n\nIt's unclear how allowing travelers to keep their shoes on would affect TSA PreCheck, the program that lets fliers pay for expedited airport screening, including the perk of keeping their footwear on through security checkpoints."

        "content": "The courts cannot protect us from President Donald Trumps unconstitutional overreach. That is the terrifying lesson of Fridays 63 Supreme Court ruling limiting the power of federal judges to issue broad orders blocking Trumps policies from taking effect while the lawsuits challenging them make their way through the courts. The case, Trump v. CASA, involved one of the most blatantly unconstitutional of Trumps orders: his bid to revoke, by executive fiat, the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship. But the implications of the ruling extend far beyond that single issue. Fridays decision means that courts are now hobbled from stopping any of the Administrations actions, no matter how unconstitutional they may be, nor how much damage they will inflict. Once again, the Courts conservative super-majority abandoned its constitutionally assigned role and dangerously empowered the President. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it in her dissent, its decision is nothing less than an open invitation for the Government to bypass the Constitution.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nThis outcome was as unnecessary as it was unwise. Witness the victory lap that President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi took in the White House briefing room after the ruling was released. Trump crowed that the Court had defused a grave threat to democracy, in which a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president. Bondi, for her part, decried rogue judges striking down President Trumps policies through lawless injunctions that let district-court judges act as emperors.\n\nIt remains unlikely that the Court, when it finally gets around to deciding the merits of the dispute, will uphold Trumps effort to undo birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship was the rule before it was written into the Fourteenth Amendment. (The departure that necessitated constitutional protection was the Courts infamous 1857 holding in Dred Scott v. Sandford, which held that people of African descent are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word citizens in the Constitution.) And the language of the Amendment is clear: All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. (The caveatsubject to the jurisdictionis a carve out for the children of diplomats and other minor exceptions.) That guarantee has been codified in federal law; it was affirmed in an 1898 ruling in the case of Wong Kim Ark, the U.S.-born son of Chinese immigrants. The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born within the territory of the United States of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States, the Court said in that case, and subsequent rulings have repeated that conclusion. No surprise, then, that three district-court judges reviewing the executive order had little trouble finding that the edict was probably unconstitutional, and that three appeals courts that reviewed their work left intact their rulings blocking the order from taking effect. Equally telling, the Supreme Court majority said not a word about the legality of the order itself.\n\nBut imagine the harms that can ensue in the meantime: parents unable to obtain Social Security numbers for their children; infants denied health coverage or nutrition assistance. Sotomayors dissent, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, raised the prospect that Trumps order may even wrench newborns from the arms of parents lawfully in the United States, for it purports to strip citizenship from the children of parents legally present on a temporary basis. If this warning sounds overblown, let me introduce you to the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller. And this gets to why the consequences of Trump v. CASA reverberate beyond birthright citizenship. No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates, Sotomayor warned. Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship. Sotomayor had more hypotheticals in her arsenal. Suppose an executive order barred women from receiving unemployment benefits or black citizens from voting. Is the Government irreparably harmed, and entitled to emergency relief, by a district court order universally enjoining such policies? she asked. The majority, apparently, would say yes. Those unlikely scenarios underscore the scary implications of the Courts approach, but the real-world consequences of Fridays decision are undeniable. They span the landscape of Trumps executive orders and other actions, including efforts to impose more stringent voter-identification requirements, relocate transgender women prisoners to male facilities, and freeze foreign aid.\n\nThe majority got the balance dangerously wrong, but there is a legitimate debate over the proper reach of what are called universal or nationwide injunctions. Democratic and Republican Presidents have chafed at orders from district-court judges, often cherry-picked by plaintiffs for their demonstrated sympathies, that prevent policies from being implemented across the country, sometimes for years. Look, there are all kinds of abuses of nationwide injunctions, Kagan said at the oral argument in the birthright case last month, and the dissent acknowledged that there may be good reasons not to issue universal injunctions in the typical case. But the birthright citizenship order was particularly ill-suited to serve as a vehicle for curbing such injunctions. The order itself is likely doomed. The governments argument that the injunctions were causing it irreparable harm is unconvincing; leaving in place what has been the rule for centuries is no hardship. And the governments proposed alternativethat the injunctions keeping birthright-citizenship protections in place apply only to the individual plaintiffs, not to a broader group of those affectedmakes little sense in the context of citizenship, which should be decided on a national basis, not relegated to a haphazard patchwork dictated by circumstances of geography or the capacity to secure a lawyer. As the dissenters put it, This is not a scenario where granting universal relief will encourage forum shopping or give plaintiffs the upper hand. Quite the opposite: By awarding universal relief below, the District Courts just ordered the Government to do everywhere what any reasonable jurist would order the Government to do anywhere.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, ruled that courts must limit themselves to orders that deal with the disputes immediately before them; they may not rove beyond the case at hand to resolve issues for those who arent parties to it. At oral argument, Barrett had seemed to express some exasperation with the governments position, so it was disappointing to see her in the majority. But Barrett left open the possibility that the states challenging the birthright order could prove they needed the broader relief of a blanket ban, leaving that question to lower courts to determine. She also suggested that those challenging Administration orders had another option: they could file their suits as class actions. This would be more comforting if the Court in recent years had not made it more difficult for plaintiffs to obtain class-action status and if the Solicitor General, D. John Sauer, had not said that the government would probably oppose granting class status, at least in the context of birthright citizenship. Then there is the concurring opinion in Fridays case by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas; they warned that district courts should not view todays decision as an invitation to certify nationwide classes without scrupulous adherence to the rigors of its requirements. In other words, dont count on class actions to rein in Administrations bent on abusing the law.\n\nGiven Congresss abdication of its constitutional role, the courts remain the best immediate vehicle for combatting Trumps excesses. (Elections are a better solution, but they remain far off.) With Fridays ruling, though, they are unnecessarily handcuffed. If there is one thing we have learned during the five long months of the second Trump Administration, it is how easy it is to inflict damage on programs and institutions, and how hard that damage is to repair. This is an example of the Court stripping its own branch of power, and at the worst possible moment. "

        "content": "Leaders of NATO member nations pose for a photo on Wednesday during the summit at The Hague.\n\nDays before NATO was set to convene in the Netherlands, one of its top commanders, Pierre Vandier, tasked with transforming the alliance for the next fight, put out a call: Britain will need to step up its intelligence contributions to the alliance going forward.\n\nThe UK has this in its DNA, Vandier said.\n\nIt was an acknowledgment that the United States, pivoting toward a far greater intelligence threat from China, may leave its European allies behind in their own existential fight with Russia. A lack of reliability on the worlds leading AI superpower, European officials say, will render the continent vulnerable in a race for intelligence superiority set to revolutionize global battlefields.\n\nThe rush toward artificial intelligence has been a strong undercurrent at the NATO summit in The Hague this week, which has served not only as a gathering for leaders of the alliance, but also as a defense industry forum for emerging power players in Silicon Valley, treated in Hollands gilded halls as a new kind of royalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI is going to be an important part of warfare going forward, but its still very new, and NATO tends not to be at the tip of the spear of innovation  and there is some division within the alliance on how to develop AI, when it comes to AI regulation and safety, said Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nTech companies dont hold the same pride of place in the European economic system, and theyre not consumed with the need to compete with China militarily  they are much more focused on Russia, Bergmann added. While the U.S. is about winning the AI race, Europeans are watching whats happening in Ukraine and saying, We just need to deter Russia.\n\nSo far, for European capitals, that has meant incorporating powerful data collection and processing systems into defense departments and improving the performance of automated surveillance systems and drones  skills well within Europes capabilities. Several German and French companies, such as Helsing, Azur and Quantum Systems, are already developing products based on what they are seeing in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the next fight will require technologies that dwarf existing drone capabilities, experts said.\n\nWeve been predicting for a while that there would be integration of AI into military research and development and defense systems, and I expect, for example, that advanced cybercapabilities will play an important role in the coming years, said Jonas Vollmer, chief operating officer of the AI Futures Project. Europe has influence, but it is grappling with the difficult reality that they dont have access or strong domestic development of frontier AI systems, and they are pretty far behind.\n\nLast year, NATO allies agreed to speed up the adoption of artificial intelligence in its operations. There are signs the bloc senses urgency to do so, signing an agreement with Palantir, a U.S.-based technology company, to incorporate AI into its warfighting systems after just six months of negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United States and China are far ahead of competitors in the race for AI superiority, measured in raw computing power and proximity to general artificial intelligence  AI that has human-level cognitive capabilities to learn and develop on its own  and ultimately to superintelligence, surpassing the human mind.\n\nVoices Chabria: How conflict with Iran could supercharge Trumps domestic agenda With a shaky ceasefire betwen Iran and Israel, many Americans are approaching the Fourth of July with a sense of trepidation, if not outright fear.\n\nStill, the United Kingdom is a serious player in the field. The kingdom ranks third in government investment in AI research anywhere in the world and maintains strong partnerships with some of the most powerful U.S. players.\n\nIn its most recent defense strategy, also published shortly before the NATO summit, Britain committed to integrate artificial intelligence into its NATO-first national security approach. Forecasts of when Artificial General Intelligence will occur are uncertain but shortening, with profound implications for Defence, the document reads.\n\nEuropes race for intelligence capabilities is driven, in part, by lessons learned on the battlefields of Ukraine. But Russia is not seen as an AI powerhouse in and of itself. Moscow instead uses low-cost tests of drone incursions and cyberattacks to keep pressure on the alliance, Vandier told the Times of London in an interview. The aim, I think, is to consume all our energy in purely defensive actions, which are very costly, he said.\n\nWhether Russia can enhance its own AI capabilities is an open question.\n\nThe key ingredients of being at the frontier with AI are talent and data centers, said Vollmer, of the AI Futures Project.\n\nRussia lags far behind on both, he added, but they can collaborate with China, of course."

        "content": "CNN \n\nSenate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow.\n\nAsked if subpoenas were on the table, Durbin said that no decision has been made on that yet. He said that it was too soon to share more information about what his committees hearing on Supreme Court ethics might look like. He and other Judiciary Democrats sent a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts last week calling for him to open an investigation into the Thomas allegations.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomass blatant violation of law.\n\nI hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information, Blumenthal said.\n\nOther Democrats on the committee said Tuesday that they were deferring to Durbin, who huddled with Democrats on Monday evening to discuss their strategy towards Thomas.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans appear mostly united in defending the Thomas, suggesting the court can handle its own affairs.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts to deal with these court internal issues.\n\nThe Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution, McConnell told reporters Tuesday.\n\nBringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the courts jerk to the right  particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench  has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. In recent years, the conservative majority has handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights, dismantling gun regulations and reining in the powers of executive branch agencies  all prompting outcry from Democrats.\n\nEven as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary.\n\nIm disturbed by the recent reports detailing potentially unethical  even potentially illegal conduct  at the highest levels of our judiciary, Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said at a Judiciary Committee hearing for three lower court nominees on Tuesday. It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.\n\nDurbin said in a speech that Congress shouldnt have to wait for the court to act.\n\nThe Supreme Court doesnt need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must, Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday.\n\nBack-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow  and even a real estate transaction  went unreported in Thomas annual financial disclosures.\n\nThomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the courts disclosure rules for so-called personal hospitality. After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference  which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary  recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mothers home to Crow.\n\nIf the reports are accurate, it stinks, Sen. Mitt Romney said Monday evening, in rare comments from a Republican criticizing Thomas lack of transparency.\n\nRepublicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally\n\nOther Republicans lined up in defense of the justice  who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991  and said it wasnt Congress place to push an ethics code on the high court.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.\n\nThis is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former presidents efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases.\n\nYet Republicans have shown little interest in joining Democrats in using legislation to impose an ethics code on the justices.\n\nThe Court, kind of historically I think, has sort of policed itself, said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOPs Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.\n\nLets see what the court does, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN Tuesday. I prefer them to do it internally."

        "content": "Editors Note: Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN The Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has been a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Jones is co-author of Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete. She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphias 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN \n\nThe ruling earlier this month by a Texas federal judge to suspend the US Food and Drug Administrations approval of a drug that is used frequently for medication abortions, is very personal for me.\n\nRoxanne Jones CNN\n\nThats because I took mifepristone years ago during a miscarriage, and it saved my life.\n\nWhen I was prescribed mifepristone, it had not yet taken center stage in Americas abortion wars. I did not have to make a rushed road trip across state lines to get my medicine, unlike many women who need the drug but live in one of the many states that have restricted access to medication abortion or passed near-total bans on abortion.\n\nI was not forced to set up a secret meet-up with a stranger in order to buy my medicine on the black market, as several women I spoke to recently said they planned to do. Nor did I have to order mifepristone online and find myself navigating the many scammers taking advantage of the current patchwork of state abortion laws in the US.\n\nMifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion and the other, misoprostol, was not subject to the ruling by the Texas judge. The two drugs can be administered to someone having a miscarriage, allowing them to terminate the pregnancy when the fetus is not viable.\n\nIt happened some years ago: After experiencing more than a day of hemorrhaging during the first trimester of my pregnancy, I visited my ob-gyn, who explained after examining me that my blood pressure was dropping rapidly and the heavy bleeding I was experiencing was an unmistakable sign of a miscarriage.\n\nFor many women, being prescribed mifepristone is part of their routine medical care. Not so in my case: As my doctor explained, I was facing a dire medical emergency. I was grateful for the medication that saved my life.\n\nMy miscarriage took me by surprise. I had loved being pregnant the first time around, about a decade earlier. And as a healthy woman, I had no reason for fear when I became pregnant again. By the time I was administered mifepristone, I was losing a life that I had already begun to love. And like many other women, despite my level of education or economic status, I could not outrun the statistics that put Black women at higher risk.\n\nUp to one in four known pregnancies will end in a miscarriage. And for Black women, the numbers are alarmingly higher. According to an analysis of 4.6 million pregnancies in seven countries, the risk of a miscarriage for Black women is 43% higher than for White women.\n\nIn the Black community, women have traditionally been taught to bear their burdens silently  keep your business to yourself  even after something as devastating as pregnancy loss. We are conditioned to do as I did back then, and keep it moving as we try to outrun the long list of statistics that tell us our lives are in danger from every direction, whether it be from health care risks to societal injustices or other stressors.\n\nDuring my miscarriage, I was a woman who was afraid, hemorrhaging and in excruciating pain, in desperate need of safe, emergency medical care. Thanks to the administration of mifepristone, I was allowed dignity during my miscarriage. Its what every woman deserves  whether it be facing a potentially life-threatening miscarriage or seeking an abortion.\n\nI learned from my experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access to whatever medicines and counseling we need to help us heal and that includes mifepristone. What we dont need is to be criminalized by politicians and punitive reproductive laws that have long been out of step with public opinion. Despite the continuing political attacks on womens reproductive rights, more than 61% of US adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nAfter the US Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued a temporary order to preserve the status quo, ensuring access to the drug while giving the justices more time to study the issue.\n\nI am hoping the justices can put politics aside and focus on the science surrounding the safety of mifepristone, a drug that, thankfully, I had access to when my life was in danger. Mifepristone, a synthetic steroid, is even safer than common prescription drugs including penicillin and Viagra.\n\nFollowing the science demands that, regardless of where you stand on the issue of abortion, consideration must be made for cases like mine and the millions of other women who for years have safely used this medication for complications surrounding miscarriages.\n\nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter. We welcome your ideas and comments.\n\nWe do not know how the legal fight over medication abortion will unfold. But women across the nation  in blue and red states alike  are watching. Punitive laws like the one signed last week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seek to criminalize reproductive care providers. And worse, they are stripping us of rights that men take for granted  its unlikely they will be prohibited by the law from making health care decisions about their own bodies.\n\nIt must end. And Im betting that whether it be with our voice or our votes, women will have the last word."

        "content": "In America and other developed countries, declining birth rates are prompting concerns that a population decline will cause economic stagnation and drain social welfare systems.\n\nThats drawing attention from a cross section of groups raising alarms about population collapse and promoting policies to encourage childbearing. The pro-natalist movement has a foothold in the White House, with President Donald Trump calling for a baby boom, Vice President JD Vance and former adviser Elon Musk championing large families, and administration policy aligning with anti-abortion advocates.\n\nU.S. senators are now debating Mr. Trumps budget bill, which targets a number of family-related issues such as the child tax credit and college financing.\n\nWhy We Wrote This A record-low U.S. birth rate is sparking a movement to encourage people to have more babies. A challenge is unlocking why people are having fewer children than they say they want.\n\nThe groups who want Americans to have more babies promote a broad spectrum of reasoning. But there is common concern around a gap between the number of children people want and the number theyre having. Most (73%) idealize having either two or three kids, according to a Gallup survey; but the fertility rate (the number of live births per reproductive-age female) is a record-low 1.6.\n\nThe fact that peoples desires to have kids remain high but that birth rates are falling is evidence that our society is not built in a way that allows people to fulfill their basic desires to have a family, says Karen Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nMany policy experts, including those who say theres an urgent need for more babies in the United States, agree that whats in the budget bill wont do much to boost births. Broader efforts are needed, they say.\n\nThe budget bill\n\nThe Senate bill would boost the child tax credit 10%, taking it to $2,200. Raising the credit has bipartisan support. The bill also includes $1,000 payments to savings accounts, called Trump Accounts, for children born between 2024 and 2028.\n\nIm glad Congress is committed to raising the [child tax credit] ... but I would like to see them do even more, said Lyman Stone, director of the Pronatalist Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies, which promotes traditional family structures.\n\nThe focus on family is something both progressives and conservatives agree on, says Patrick Brown, a fellow with the Ethics & Public Policy Center who advocates for policies that encourage more births. He aims to [make] it so that family is at the center of what were doing rather than just sort of economizing individuals.\n\nThat includes making it easier for people to get married and start a family, and allowing parents to raise their children in a way that doesnt feel so isolating or individualistic, says Mr. Brown.\n\nThe budget, he says, is not my version of a pro-family agenda.\n\nIts not that experts say financial incentives, along the lines of an expanded child credit, arent helpful and needed for parents. Its that financial incentives alone may not be enough. The Republicans bill also proposes spending cuts  including to social welfare programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  that directly hit the finances of many lower-income families.\n\nAnd despite spending cuts, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecasts Mr. Trumps bill will add $3.3 trillion in debt over the next decade.\n\nTheyre basically trying to cut safety net benefits in order to help cover the cost of your tax cuts for folks [in] the upper-income side of the distribution, says Mr. Brown.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A family enjoys the beach in Waveland, Mississippi, April 16, 2025. With the U.S. fertility rate at an all-time low, the Trump administration wants Americans to have more babies.\n\nThe budget also makes major cuts to the federal student loan program, and qualifies K-12 expenses, including private school tuition, for pretax savings accounts, which now are limited to college-related costs. The bill included a proposed school choice pathway for K-12 education, but that faced a setback Friday when the Senate parliamentarian said it was among several items that violate procedure rules and must be considered separately from the megabill.\n\nThe policies are consistent with a report by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Heritage declined to talk with the Monitor for this story.\n\nIn addition to the budget bill, senators are considering a bipartisan proposal that would eliminate families costs for childbirth by requiring health insurers to cover the entire bill. President Trump has meanwhile announced expanded access to in vitro fertilization treatments. The White House has not released details.\n\nThe countrys population trend is not yet a crisis, says Catherine Pakaluk, director of Political Economy at the Catholic University of Americas Busch School of Business. But it is on a collision course with the governments economic commitments. In the short term, she says, policymakers need to try for economic security by balancing the budget  a task, she says, that is not remotely easy.\n\nBig tent, big differences, one aim\n\nPeople who agree that the U.S. needs more babies can also be at odds. In March, the second annual NatalCon brought together IVF specialists, anti-abortion activists, demographers, and far-right extremists concerned about minority populations outpacing white people.\n\nIVF is a point of contention. Those who consider conception the beginning of life oppose the disposal of embryos, which is a routine part of the IVF process.\n\nAnother group, from the tech industry, wants to apply technology to creating babies, including the use of IVF and genetic testing to screen for intellect or potential health issues.\n\nSerious conversations about the U.S. fertility rate are happening among researchers and pro-childbirth groups who distance themselves from positions linked with racism, sexism, and eugenics.\n\nFor instance, policies to encourage more births would result in more births among nonwhite communities, as well, says Mr. Stone. And were totally fine with that.\n\nLike Mr. Stones organization, many who support a higher birth rate also promote the idea that traditional families  married heterosexual couples with children  are ideal.\n\nThat ideal does not require a woman to give up on education or a meaningful career, says Mr. Brown. Women should be able to exercise their talents in the same way that men can, he says. The way out of this trap that were in is by reorienting our economy, accommodating all people having family and work life, rather than pitting men against women.\n\nBut there are concerns that focusing on fertility could further limit womens reproductive options. The 2022 Supreme Court reversed federal recognition of a right to abortion when it overturned Roe v. Wade; since then, more than half of U.S. states have increased restrictions on the practice.\n\nAny strategy aimed at fertility will ultimately sideline reproductive options, says Leigh Senderowicz, who studies fertility policies as a demographer and public health researcher with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We just have decades and decades and decades of evidence that this is the case.\n\nPeople are balancing competing goods\n\nA collection of studies indicates anxieties about the cost of living, career pursuits, the housing shortage, and a breakdown in community supports are contributing to slowing birth rates. Americas birth rate is below the global average.\n\nOne Pew Research Center survey shows nearly two-thirds of adults believe free child care would encourage more people to have children; half say paid family leave and more tax credits for parents would help, and 45% say a monthly stipend would do it.\n\nMr. Brown and Mr. Stone, whose work often intersects, both link the fertility rate to a decline in the marriage rate. Another Pew survey shows one-third of adults who never had children said it was because they didnt find the right partners. Twelve percent said it was because they couldnt afford it.\n\nEducation matters, too. Mr. Brown says the U.S. should take notes from European models of higher education, which take fewer years for professionals who require graduate-level schooling. That means a person can get an earlier start on their career and family, he says.\n\nBut most European countries have even lower fertility rates than the U.S., including Nordic countries, which Americans generally laud for their family-centered policies and institutions.\n\nPeople are having fewer children because thats what they really prefer, says Dr. Pakaluk, whose book Hannahs Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth explores why some women choose to have more children than others.\n\nMost people are doing a thing where theyre balancing competing goods in their lives, she says.\n\nChildren today are a want, not a need, she adds, and the best way to influence values is with information campaigns  for example, stories from communities that desire more children about what its like to be a parent.\n\nBecause information is the single most powerful changer of peoples choices, she adds.\n\nAmanda Stevenson, a demographer at the University of Colorado Boulder who leads the Colorado Fertility Project, says population shifts dont need to cause alarm.\n\nPolitics and demographics are constantly influencing each other, and population is always changing, she says. Other parts of society are in flux, such as where people live and who cares for children and older adults, and people will find infinite ways to respond to population changes.\n\nWe need to work on this together, says Professor Stevenson. We will respond in other ways, and it wont just be the escalation of this [population] panic.\n\nDr. Guzzo points out that birth rates are down, but the population in the U.S. and the world is still growing.\n\nPopulation collapse is not imminent, says Dr. Guzzo. The number of people in the U.S. is expected to grow until about 2080, then plateau or decline super slowly over time. Beyond that, she says, assumptions lose hold.\n\nThe number and types of jobs, for instance, will change as artificial intelligence replaces people in the workplace.\n\nWe cant predict a whole lot of things because humans are remarkably resilient and inventive, she says."

        "content": "While military strategists scramble to learn the damage done by U.S. bombs and missiles in Iran, many scholars and Iranian Americans are wondering what this means for the people and architectural treasures of Isfahan.\n\nThe Isfahan area, which includes one of the three Iranian nuclear sites that the U.S. targeted Saturday, is also home to one of the countrys most historic cities, full of landmarks from Persias years as a regional power in the 17th century.\n\nIsfahan is thought of as a sort of treasure, like a vestige of a different Iran, said Jasmin Darznik, who spent part of her childhood in Iran before becoming a novelist and chair of the MFA writing program at California College of the Arts in San Francisco. I think people have a very special feeling about the place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTravel & Experiences What treasures might be lost in Iran if the worst happens? As Iran faces off against the U.S., our travel writer recalls a rare road trip and its lessons about history, culture and the importance of seeing the distinction between a people and their government.\n\nThe citys architecture includes intricately tiled mosques, several stately bridges and a sprawling square that has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. American and Israeli military leaders focus on the nuclear complex 14 miles east of Isfahan and the 2.2 million people in the city, but the list of cultural assets there is also long.\n\nA UNESCO report recently noted that the regions 17th-century leaders established colourful tiling as the most salient characteristic of Iranian architecture, and this decorative style reached its zenith in Isfahan.\n\nAmong the landmarks:\n\nNaqsh-e Jahan Square is the second-largest public square in the world, surpassed only by Tiananmen Square in Beijing. (Kaveh Kazemi / Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaqsh-e Jahan Square, also known as Shah Square and Imam Square, was laid out between 1598 and 1629 , its broad central area surrounded by mosques, palaces and the Isfahan Bazaar. The open space is about 1,800 feet long and about 520 feet wide, which appears to make it the second-largest public square in the world, surpassed only by Tiananmen Square in Beijing.\n\nThe Masjed-e Jm, also known as the Jm Mosque or Great Mosque of Isfahan, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012. It goes back to the year 841, its grounds showing how Islamic architecture has evolved over 12 centuries. It is the oldest Friday (congregational) mosque in Iran.\n\nThe Si-o-Se Pol Bridge, also known as the Bridge of 33 Arches, was begun in 1599 and completed in 1602. Illuminated by night, it harbors tea houses on its lower deck and has served as a gathering spot for generations. At 977 feet long, it is the largest of 11 historic bridges spanning the Zayandeh River.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKhaju Bridge is often billed as the most beautiful bridge in Isfahan. (Rasoul Shojaei / IRNA / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nKhaju Bridge is younger and shorter than the Si-o-Se Pol Bridge but is often billed as the most beautiful bridge in Isfahan. It was built around 1650 and made of stone and bricks with tile work above its arches. It is about 449 feet long.\n\nAs the U.S. stepped into the war between Israel and Iran, U.S. military authorities told the New York Times they targeted Iranian sites in Fordo and Natanz with bunker buster bombs and Isfahan with missiles from a submarine. As of noon Sunday, CNN reported 18 destroyed or damaged structures at the Isfahan nuclear complex outside the city, which was built in 1984 and is thought to employ 3,000 scientists, making it Irans largest nuclear research complex.\n\nThis satellite image shows the Isfahan nuclear facility in Iran after U.S. strikes. (Maxar Technologies / Associated Press)\n\nThere were no reports of damage or casualties in central Isfahan.\n\nMuch of the city goes back to the Safavid dynasty, which lasted unbroken from 1501 to 1722. During the dynastys peak years, the Safavids held power over what is now Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Armenia, along with parts of Georgia, Russia, Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Turkey and other countries.\n\nThe leader during many of those peak years was King Abbas I, also known as Abbas the Great, who assumed power at age 16, ruled from 1587 to 1629, chose Isfahan as his empires capital and effectively rerouted the Silk Road to include the city. While Shakespeare was writing plays in England and Caravaggio was painting in Italy, Isfahans landmarks were taking shape and, thanks to the Silk Road trade, Persian rugs began showing up in the homes of wealthy Europeans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of his tenure, nervous about succession, Abbas I had one of his sons killed and two blinded. Still, the family dynasty continued for another century. Once the dynasty fell, Isfahan lost its status as Persias capital but retained its reputation for beauty."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Last year, the comedian Marc Maron brought the author Chuck Klosterman on as a guest on his WTF podcast. The two discussed many things (including Klostermans then-new book, But What If Were Wrong?, which he was there to promote), but one of them was sportsand the particular thrill that they offer to audiences. Sporting events, Klosterman argued, promise that most dramatic of things: an unknown outcome. Unlike other widely watched eventsthe Super Bowl halftime show, the Grammys, the Oscarsthe primary selling point of sporting events is that their endings are, by definition, unpredictable. Within them, anything can happen.\n\nWell. While you can say a lot about the Oscars on Sunday, you cant say that the glitzy awards show was boringly predictable. The 89th Annual Academy Awards ceremony, right at its conclusion, brought a mixture of confusion and shock and full, deep delight to its viewers as Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway teamed up to announce the Best Picture winner and proceeded to, because of a backstage flub, announce the wrong movie. Chaosand really, really good TVensued. Tired East Coasters were summoned back to their living rooms from their bedrooms, on the grounds that ohmyGodyouveGOTtoseethis. Twitter erupted with jokesabout Bonnie and Clyde being at it again, about Schrdingers envelope, about Dewey Defeats Truman getting an Oscars-friendly update. It was late on a Sunday evening, and the unexpected had happened in the most unexpected of ways, and the whole thing was, as my colleague Adam Serwer perfectly summed it up, Moon-lit.\n\nDuring a time when Google has made so much information attainable, knowingness has become a default presence in American cultural life.\n\nThe whole thing was also, however, a reminder of how rare it has become for audiences to witness, collectively, something that is truly Unexpected. This was live TV, with all the potential human error that live TV can bringchaos, correction, drama, graceat its depths but also its heights. What happened on Sunday hewed to roughly the same mechanics that gave the world all those Left Shark memes, and those Nevertheless, She Persisted tattoos, and the term wardrobe malfunction: The Oscars evoked caring by way of surprise. The Best Picture flub has become infamous overnight for roughly the same reason its predecessors did: It is exceedingly rare, in the highly produced world of mass media, for expectations to be thwarted.\n\nWe know so much, nowadays. We are, in fact, sure of so muchabout politics and human psychology and Hollywood awards shows and the correct ingredients of guacamole. During a time when Google has made so much information instantly attainable, knowingness has become a default presence in American cultural life. Oooh, that show is supposed to be excellent. That movie is supposed to be terrible. Poke bowls are the thing now. Big cultural events, the stuff of the Grammys and the Emmys and the Oscars, are in many ways the culmination of that posture: We know precisely what to expect of them. We can report, as they play out, that everything went according to plan, because we knew from the beginning what they were supposed to be; we can do that reporting, as well, with a note of disappointment. There are few things duller, after all, than met expectations.\n\nThere are few things duller than met expectations.\n\nIn that context, the Beatty-Dunaway-Oscars flub was a gift to audiences (and perhaps to ABCs future live-audience ratings). It was also Chuck Klostermans point to Maron, at once proven and proven wrong. Here was the anything-can-happen logic of the live sporting event, applied to Hollywoods highest, most ceremonialized, and most expectation-driven, of rituals. That was a powerful thing: During a moment in the United States that so often takes for granted that reality is something that can be produced as well as experienced, the Best Picture Oscars flub was a powerful reminder that reality, still, has its own production values.\n\nYes, the flub was many other things, too: a shame for Moonlight, which so richly deserved to win Best Picture and whose victory threatens to be overshadowed by the mistake and its ensuing dramas. A shame for La La Land, whose producers delivered their full acceptance speeches before learning that their win had been announced in error. A field day for photographers both professional and non-, who snapped reaction shots onstage and backstage and among the celebrity audience. A moment of grace, as La La Lands producer, Jordan Horowitz, met Jimmy Kimmels cheeky suggestion that everyone should get an Oscar with a politely defiant Im going to be really thrilled to hand this to my friends from Moonlight. And also, sure: a metaphor for the slings and arrows of the 2016 election. A ratification of pop culture's current obsession with alternate realities. A vehicle for many, many jokes at the expense of Steve Harvey.\n\nMostly, though, it was a twist ending that arrived, by the looks of things, in the twistiest of ways: a shock that came not at the hands of a savvy producer, but at the hands of quirky reality. Twist endings may have been a defining feature of the events of 2016 and early 2017the reality show that was the 2016 presidential campaign found its pundit-ratified frontrunner vanquished in the final episode; the 2016 World Series featured another victorious underdog; Super Bowl LI found the expected winners winning, but only after its game went into nail-biting overtime. Their twists, however, took place within events whose endings were, by definition, unknown. The Oscars was a ceremony, shockingly interrupted. It was expectation, compellingly thwarted.\n\nAnd so: It was powerful in a way that few things can be, anymore, in a world that knows so much and expects, in the end, so little. In an essay for Screen Crush last year, Erin Whitney argued that ours is a culture built on anticipation, where movies end with scenes teasing the next installment in the franchise, never allowing a moments rest to absorb what we just saw. We talk about movies years before they debut, we analyze TV plot twists, and anticipate albums for years before hearing a single song. This whole process has led, Whitney argued, to the slow death of surprise.\n\nThe best evidence for that may be the fact that marketers have recently been focused on surprising consumerscapitalism doing its best to keep that particular kind of magic alive. The dropped album. The surprise TV show. The secretly produced trailer. The live-aired, anything-could-happen TV musical. They are trying to capture what Klosterman was conveying to Maron in that WTF interview: Sports is a connection to authentic aliveness, the author put it to the comedian. This is not something that anybody can control or script. Its this unknown thing. He added: Theres something real interesting about nobody knows, because you just dont experience that anymore.\n\nYou dont, until you dountil that mistake makes its way onto the glitziest and scriptiest of all of Hollywoods stages. Sundays Best Picture flub is not only already iconic; it is also already the subject of conspiracy theories from a wide range of Oscar truthers who suggest that, among other things, the mistake was the result of President Trump exacting revenge on Jimmy Kimmel; or a prank pulled by Kimmel himself; or the dark dealings of Leonardo DiCaprio. They may have a point; it is unclear, for now, how the wrong card got into Warren Beattys hands. What they forget, though, is what Klosterman knows, and what all those delighted audiences, on Sunday, knew along with him: that the best conspirator is often peoples great capacity to make big, and dramatic, mistakes."

I could only imagine how I would be feeling if I didnt understand the language and I didnt know anyone.\n\nTaylor said he was at a loss to explain why he was singled out for extra questioning, but he speculated that perhaps it was because of the Obama-Biden T-shirt packed in his suitcase.\n\nTaylor was returning from a weeklong vacation in Turks and Caicos with his wife and daughter, who were in a separate customs line, when a CBP agent asked, Are you from California? He said he answered, Yeah, I live in Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man who ran campaigns for L.A.s last Republican mayor and for current Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla when he was a budding Los Angeles City Council candidate in the 1990s found himself escorted to a waiting room and separated from his family.\n\nThere, Taylor said he waited 45 minutes without being released, alleging he was unjustly marked for detention and intimidated by CBP agents.\n\nI have no idea why I was targeted, said Taylor, a consultant with the campaign to reelect L.A. City Councilwoman Traci Park. They dont talk to you. They dont give you a reason. Youre just left confused, angry and worried.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story was first reported by Westside Current .\n\nFormer Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said the incident brought to mind Sen. Alex Padilla, who was arrested and handcuffed June 12 while trying to ask a question during a Los Angeles press conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nMy former chief of staff and political consultant, Rick Taylor, was detained at Miami International Airport by federal authorities after returning from an international vacation, he said in an email. As Senator Alex Padilla said a couple of weeks ago, if it could happen to me, it could happen to anyone. This Federal government operation is OUT OF CONTROL! Where will it end?!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA representative from the Customs and Border Protection in Florida said an inquiry made by the Los Angeles Times and received late Friday afternoon will likely be answered next week.\n\nIf Mr. Taylor feels the need to, he is more than welcome to file a complaint online on our website and someone will reach out to him to try and get to the bottom of things, CBP Public Affairs Specialist Alan Regalado said in an email.\n\nTaylor, a partner at Dakota Communications, a strategic communications and marketing firm, said he was more concerned about traveling and returning to the U.S. with his wife, a U.S. citizen and native of Vietnam.\n\nHe said he reached out to a Trump administration member before leaving on vacation, asking if he could contact that individual in case his wife was detained.\n\nCalifornia ICE arrests at L.A. courthouse met with alarm: Absolutely blindsided U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents intercepted defendants at a Los Angeles courthouse on Tuesday afternoon, sparking fears that such actions will deter people from serving as witnesses or answering subpoenas.\n\nThe family flew American Airlines and landed in Miami on June 20, where he planned to visit friends before returning to Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nIn a twist, Taylors wife and daughter, both Global Entry cardholders, breezed through security while Taylor, who does not have Global Entry, was detained, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said after the agent confirmed he was a Los Angeles resident, he placed a small orange tag on his passport and was told to follow a green line. That led him to another agent and his eventual holding room.\n\nTaylor described 95% of the population inside the room as Latino and largely Spanish-speaking.\n\nI was one of three white dudes in the room, he said. I just kept wondering, What I am doing here?\n\nHe said the lack of communication was very intimidating, though he was allowed to keep his phone and did send text message updates to his family.\n\nI have traveled a fair amount internationally and have never been pulled aside, he said.\n\nAbout 45 minutes into his holding, Taylor said an agent asked him to collect his luggage and hand it over for inspection.\n\nHe said he was released shortly after.\n\nThe agents have succeeded in making me reassess travel, Taylor said. I would tell others to really think twice about traveling internationally while you have this administration in charge."

        "content": "Protesters for and against gender-affirming care for transgender minors demonstrate outside the Supreme Court in December.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that states may ban puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender teens, rejecting the claim that such gender-based discrimination is unconstitutional.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the courts conservative majority said states are generally free to decide on proper standards of medical care.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said there is an ongoing debate among medical experts regarding the risks and benefits of hormone treatments for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the law at issue plainly discriminates on the basis of sex. ... By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed.\n\nWednesdays decision highlights the nations sharp right turn in the last year on transgender rights and gender-affirming care and the divide among states.\n\nThe ruling upholds laws in Tennessee and 23 other Republican-led states, all of them adopted in the last four years. Tennessee lawmakers said the number of minors being diagnosed with gender dysphoria had exploded in recent years, leading to a surge in unproven and risky medical interventions for these underage patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia and other Democratic-led states do not prohibit doctors from prescribing puberty blockers or hormones for those under age 18 who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Some, including California, have explicit protections for such care, which the high courts ruling does not undo.\n\nHowever, there are other threats to gender-affirming care in liberal states. The Trump administration has sought to prevent the use of federal funds to pay for such care, and Republicans in Congress are attempting to bar or rein in such care  for adults and children alike  under Medicaid.\n\nIn recent years, surveys have found that most large private employers and their insurers provide coverage for gender-affirming care. And in California and most Democratic states, it is illegal to discriminate in healthcare against patients based on their gender identity and transgender status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut President Trumps threats have already prompted some government-funded providers to pull back.\n\nFor example, The Times reported last week that Childrens Hospital Los Angeles will shutter its long-standing healthcare program for transgender children and young adults this summer, according to emails.\n\nThe Center for Transyouth Health and Development began informing its nearly 3,000 patient families last week that there was no viable alternative to shuttering.\n\nHospital officials in an email said continuing to provide the care would jeopardize the hospitals ability to care for all its other patients, given the threats to crucial federal funding and doctors providing such care.\n\nThe announcement left many families confused and scared, unsure of their next steps. The hospitals Transyouth center is among the only facilities that provides puberty blockers, hormones and surgical procedures for trans youth on public insurance.\n\nCaleb Smith, director of LGBTQI+ policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, said the Supreme Courts decision does not tell insurance companies that they can ignore state law and decide for themselves to not provide such coverage. But it does potentially pave a path for additional cases and additional legislation that could further erode such coverage, Smith said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, if Republicans succeed in restricting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage for such care, LGBTQ+ people would lose healthcare nationwide, Smith said.\n\nThe case decided by the Supreme Court on Wednesday began with an appeal from Biden administration Solicitor Gen. Elizabeth Prelogar, who urged the justices to hear the Tennessee case and strike down the wave of red-state laws that targeted medical treatment for transgender teens.\n\nPrelogar spoke of a broad consensus  including among American medical associations  in favor of gender-affirming care. It was unconstitutional, she argued, for states to ban evidence-based treatments supported by the overwhelming consensus of the medical community.\n\nBut Republican lawmakers voiced doubt about the long-term effect of hormone treatments for adolescents. They cited last years Cass Report from Britain, which concluded there were not long-term studies or reliable evidence in support of the treatments.\n\nThe courts six conservatives, all Republican appointees, said they were not prepared to second guess the states that had banned hormone treatments for minors.\n\nBut Tennessee Atty. Gen. Jonathan Skrmetti said the common sense of Tennessees voters prevailed over judicial activism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrans-rights advocates argued the court should have deferred to parents and doctors, not state lawmakers.\n\nWhen the political system breaks down and legislatures bow to popular hostility, the judiciary must be the Constitutions backbone, said Jennifer Levi, GLAD Law senior director of transgender and queer rights. Instead, it chose to look away, abandoning both vulnerable children and the parents who love them.\n\nLawyers for Lambda Legal and the ACLU called it a heartbreaking ruling, making it more difficult for transgender youth to escape the danger and trauma of being denied their ability to live and thrive.\n\nLGBTQ+ advocates were prepared for a loss in the Tennessee case. The courts conservatives signaled during an oral argument in December they were likely uphold the red-state laws.\n\nBut in the wake of the ruling, some feared the outcome would reach even further, including by diminishing the resolve of liberal states to continue defending such care against Trump administration threats.\n\nWithin days of taking office, Trump issued an executive order accusing medical professionals providing gender-affirming care of maiming and sterilizing children. The order said that the federal government would no longer fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support such care, and that it would rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May, the Department of Health and Human Services issued new guidance recommending behavioral therapy rather than gender-affirming care for children with gender dysphoria. The guidance was criticized by both the American Medical Assn. and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the latter of which said its policies were cited in the health departments guidance in inaccurate and misleading ways.\n\nJoe Hollendoner, chief executive of the Los Angeles LGBT Center, condemned the courts decision Wednesday, but said it does not change the law in states like California, where gender-affirming care remains legal and protected.\n\nNow more than ever, we need our medical partners to stand with our community and not act out of fear  or worse, align with the policies of a resurgent Trump-era agenda, Hollendoner said."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "On Friday 13 June, a baby was born in an Atlanta hospital to a woman who had been dead for four months. Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old Black nurse and mother, was declared brain dead in February after blood clots formed in her brain. Legally, and by all meaningful measures, she was dead then: the woman who loved her family, laughed with her friends, comforted her son, helped her colleagues and cared for her patients was gone then, and was never coming back. But the state of Georgia, and the administrators of the hospital where she was declared dead, kept her corpse in a state of artificial animation for months. Thats because when Smith went to the hospital in February complaining of a headache, and later became unresponsive, she was about eight weeks pregnant. According to her family, doctors at Emory hospital, in Georgia, told the family that the states abortion ban required them to maintain the regimen that falsely animated their daughters corpse so that the fetus inside her could continue to grow.\n\nThe Georgia state attorney general denies that the states abortion ban required this abuse of Smithss body. But other supporters of the law disagree. The result, either way, was the same: in deference to a law that created genuine ambiguity about what freedoms Smiths doctors and family had in the wake of her death, a woman who did nothing other than be pregnant was denied the right to rest in peace.\n\nBrain death is distinct from a vegetative state or a coma; it is the complete and permanent loss of the function of the entire brain, including the loss of the function of the brain stem, which is needed for basic organ functions like the reflexive intake of breath and the beating of the heart. There is no chance of recovery; usually, the invasive life support required to sustain the body of a brain dead patient is administered only long enough for the patients family to say goodbye. Thats because what life support does to a patients body, in addition to being medically futile, is also extreme and invasive. The artificial ventilator that acts as a bellows, pushing air in and out of the dead lungs, involves tubes inserted through the nose and throat, extending into the stomach and windpipe.\n\nThese tubes, in Smiths case, were tools of the state, extending the force of the law into the inside of her corpse. It was the state, via these machines, that pumped her heart, contracted her lungs, and pushed blood into the dead tissues of her body, so that cells could continue dividing inside her uterus. It was the state that used these machines to desecrate Smiths corpse  to turn it from the vessel for a beautiful person, the nurse and mother, into an object that symbolized womens degradation and Smiths disposability. What should have been a respected artifact of a loved person became a macabre marionette, pushed and pulled by a state apparatus that sees all womens bodies as mere means to its own ends.\n\nLast month, the fetus was cut out of her corpse prematurely; presumably, doctors did not think that the dead body could sustain a pregnancy any longer. Physicians working on Smiths case told her family that as a result of gestating inside a dead uterus, the resulting child could experience health complications ranging from blindness to the inability to walk. The infant that was extracted from the dead woman, a baby boy, weighs less than 2lbs, and is currently in neonatal intensive care. The family has named him Chance.\n\nThe desecration of Smiths corpse by Emory University hospital and the state of Georgia is a grim reminder of how little womens personhood is esteemed in post-Dobbs America. But Adriana is not the first woman to have her dead body abused this way. In 2013, a 33-year-old Texas woman, Marlise Muoz, was declared brain dead after suffering a pulmonary embolism. Because she was 14 weeks pregnant, the hospital argued that the state of Texas required her to be kept on life support, solely so that her corpse could be used to continue the cultivation of the fetus. Her husband, Erick, sued to have her removed from life support so that he could bury his wife and grieve in peace; still, the hospital artificially animated her corpse until a judge ordered them to stop. Marlises family would tell reporters that as they visited her body in the hospital, they could smell her flesh decaying.\n\nThere is something particularly unsettling about seeing a corpse: the absence of the person who was once there is so conspicuous that it makes the body uncanny. That the body is not the person becomes clear the moment you see a body without a human person in it. And yet the body is the instrument and vessel of the person who animates it, and as such it commands to be treated with dignity, with a kind of reverence, with the respect you would give to a human being. Abortion bans disregard this: they appropriate the body for the ends of the state, indifferent to the will or the dignity of the person who lives in it. Rape functions this way, too  using a body for an end, without deferring to the person who inhabits it. In both cases  rape and abortion bans  the body of a living person is reduced to an instrument for someone elses use. That contrast  between the dignity that a human beings body demands and the instrumentalization with which it is treated  is what supplies abortion bans and sexual violence with their moral horror. They treat living people as mere objects. In that sense, a corpse might be the perfect vehicle for the anti-abortion movements agenda: it is a female instrument without the annoying encumbrance of a female person.\n\nBut Adriana Smith was a person; so was Marlise Muoz. They were not objects, or instruments; they were people endowed with dignity and rights. In life and in death, they deserved better. Every woman does."

        "content": "Democratic senators introduced a bill on Tuesday to ban immigration officers from concealing their identities while engaged in immigration enforcement activities.\n\nThe visible act, introduced by senators Alex Padilla of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, comes in the wake of scenes of masked immigration agents in unmarked vehicles snatching people off the street without meaningfully identifying their agency or presenting a warrant, prompting observers to liken Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) arrests to kidnappings.\n\nThe bill requires officers from Ice, the Department of Homeland Security, or other state and federal agencies detailed for immigration enforcement to clearly display their agency name or acronym and either their name or badge number without tactical gear or clothing covering it up. It would prohibit non-medical face coverings such as masks or balaclavas that obscure an officers identity.\n\nMembers of the public often have no way to confirm whether they are interacting with legitimate government officials, Padilla said in a statement published with the proposed law. This lack of transparency endangers public safety by causing confusion, fear and mistrust, especially in communities already subjected to heightened immigration scrutiny. It also increases risks for law enforcement personnel by creating uncertainty in high-stress situations, particularly when individuals cannot distinguish real officers from impersonators.\n\nThe bill provides for exceptions for officer safety, such as the use of a gas mask if police are using gas to disperse a crowd, and does not apply to covert or non-public operations.\n\nAt a press conference in June, Todd Lyons, acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), defended agents concealing their identities.\n\nWe ran an operation where Ice officers were doxed, Lyons said. People are out there taking photos of the names and their faces and posting them online with death threats to their family and themselves, so Im sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks but Im not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line and their family on the line because people dont like what immigration enforcement is.\n\nIce did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill.\n\nCalifornia has become a flash point for conflicts between the public and Ice, one that became personal for Padilla after federal agents pushed him out of a news conference on 12 June and handcuffed him after he tried to ask a question of the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.\n\nIn a letter sent on Monday to Lyons, Padilla and 13 other Democratic senators posed questions about Ices policies and practices of concealing officers identities.\n\nStorming courthouses, grabbing students off the street, raiding places of work, and sweeping through restaurants at prime dining hours are in and of themselves tactics clearly designed to engender fear and sow chaos in the population, the letter states. Doing so in plainclothes, with no identification of their name or agency, while wearing a mask designed to obscure the agents face, represents a clear attempt to compound that fear and chaos  and to avoid accountability for agents actions."

        "content": "The number of rescues in the wilderness areas around Mt. St. Helens keep going up  and the actions of some of those before they call for help have drawn criticism as reckless.\n\nOne man, 21, kayaked over a waterfall, suffering a spinal injury. A 54-year-old woman glissaded down Mt. St. Helens  sliding down a snow-covered slope  and suffered a head injury when she struck a rock.\n\nEach of those rescues in May, in a remote, mountainous county, required six-hour efforts. And one West Coast sheriff is now pondering sending the most egregious victims a bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea would involve a new county ordinance where a person could be cited if they are found to be reckless or negligent in their actions where search and rescue is requested to respond, according to the Sheriffs Office in Skamania County, the remote, sparsely populated county in Washington that is home to Mt. St. Helens.\n\nI need to find a creative way to deter the current behavior we are witnessing while attempting to recoup the financial burden placed on our county, Sheriff Summer Scheyer said in a statement. This ordinance is still in the planning phase, but I believe it would be an added deterrent for those who take exceptional risks.\n\nThe number of search-and-rescue missions soared in May in Skamania County compared with the same month last year, the Sheriffs Office said, with a number of missions taking four to nine hours to complete the rescue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkamania County isnt alone. In southern Utah, the Garfield County Sheriffs Office on Tuesday announced it was requiring permits for some of the most remote and challenging slot canyons, noting a significant increase in search and rescue operations.\n\nNationwide, the number of national park search-and-rescue operations is in the thousands  3,308 in 2023  which can entail anything from a child who is separated from their parents to a hiker who is lost in the backcountry.\n\nThe idea of forcing irresponsible hikers to pay for their rescue has come up before.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the state says people may be required to pay back the costs to rescue them. One way to avoid such charges is buying Hike Safe Cards  $25 per person and $35 per family  that supports the states search-and-rescue efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne recent rescue that gained attention involved a pair of hikers who had to be rescued after they hiked despite a forecast of rain, sleet and snow in the middle of January, went off a marked trail and feared they were hypothermic. Rescuers had to break a trail  for three-quarters of a mile in steep terrain  to get to the hikers. The pair were found to be inadequately prepared for the conditions that were forecasted, the Fish and Game Department said in a news release, and neither had Hike Safe Cards.\n\nIn 2013 in California, a massive search-and-rescue operation was launched in Orange County for two hikers, Nicolas Cendoya, 19, and Kyndall Jack, 18. They called for help after going on an Easter Sunday hike in Trabuco Canyon and became lost. The cellphone they used to make the call stopped working before authorities could identify their location.\n\nCendoya was found three days later, shoeless and disoriented half a mile from their car, and Jack, the day after, in shoulder-high brush. After authorities found methamphetamine in the vehicle, which the pair had parked before the hike, some government officials called for the $160,000 rescue bill to be paid back.\n\nCendoya pleaded guilty to one felony count of drug possession but was eligible for a drug-diversion program, which if completed successfully would mean he could have the case against him dismissed. Court records indicated the case was dismissed in 2015.\n\nA judge, however, denied the Orange County Fire Authoritys request that the agency get back the $55,000 it spent on the search for the pair, saying the fire agency was not a victim of a crime and couldnt seek restitution.\n\nIn response, California lawmakers changed the law to allow government officials to seek reimbursement for future rescues, with certain conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSigned into law in 2015, the law allows a county or city to seek reimbursement for the costs of a rescue if it required the use of extraordinary methods, and was caused by an intentional act in knowing violation of any law that resulted in a criminal conviction of that person for that act.\n\nBut a county cant collect if the person rescued cant afford to pay. The county also cant collect more than $12,000 unless the person rescued was convicted of a felony.\n\nAlthough Orange County did not recoup its costs, the hikers did face other legal action to hold them financially accountable.\n\nJack was sued by a volunteer rescuer who was injured during the search, falling more than 100 feet, according to the rescuers attorneys. The volunteer, who accused Jack of negligently putting rescuers in danger, received $100,000 as part of a legal settlement, paid from a homeowners insurance policy held by Jacks mother. The rescuers attorney said Cendoya also settled with the rescuer for an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nSome search-and-rescue organizations dont support the idea of charging people needing rescue. No one should ever be made to feel they must delay in notifying the proper authorities of a search or rescue incident out of fear of possible charges, the Mountain Rescue Assn. says.\n\nIn a position paper in 2009, the association said that most services that rescue people in the mountains in the U.S. are provided by teams of unpaid professional rescue mountaineers who give up their own time to participate in search and rescue activities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe typical search and rescue mission is over within a matter of a few hours, and with the vast majority of the work performed by unpaid professional volunteers, the costs are generally very low, Charley Shimanski, then the president of the Mountain Rescue Assn., said in a statement.\n\nIts true that teams are sometimes over-taxed, and that newcomers to the backcountry call 911 in questionable circumstances, the Colorado Search and Rescue Assn. said. Yet we still dont believe charging for services is the answer. We know from experience that when people think theyre going to be charged, they often delay calling, or even intentionally evade, rescuers.\n\nTimes staff writer Alex Wigglesworth contributed to this report."

        "content": "Todays White House press briefing featured a storm of questions about former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the kneeling protests that have spread throughout the NFL, interspersed with inquiries about North Korea and Jared Kushners private email server. Here are some of White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders most depraved responses from todays briefing.\n\nWhen asked if President Trump had gone too far by calling NFL players sons of bitches who should be fired, Huckabee Sanders response was:\n\nI think its always appropriate for the president of the United States to defend our flag, to defend the national anthem and to defend the men and women who fought and died to defend it.\n\nHuckabee Sanders mentioned several times that the NFL protests and Trumps responses to them have nothing to do with race. It was brought to her attention that Colin Kaepernicks purpose was to protest racial inequality and police brutality, but it has instead been interpreted as disrespectful to our troops and our flag. However, white supremacist protestors claimed their protests were about heritage and not hate, which Trump was more inclined to accept. When questioned about this disparity, Huckabee Sanders response was:\n\nI think if the debate for them is really about police brutality, then they should protest the officers on the field that are protecting them instead of the American flag.\n\nShe later said that wasnt what she meant, and that she was kind of pointing out the hypocrisy in that, if the message is police brutality, which theyve stated, then that doesnt seem very appropriate to protest the American flag. Im not sure how those two things would be combined.\n\nWhen asked if Jared Kushners emails from his private server would be released, Huckabee Sanders said that she did not have information regarding that issue.\n\nWhen asked about why Trump made the speech that he made at the United Nations after being warned not to provoke North Korea, Huckabee Sanders response was:\n\nThats a false narrative. The national security team was involved and engaged throughout the speech-writing process and was very happy with the presidents speech at the UN.\n\nWhen asked about Tom Prices travel in a private aircraft, spending $400,000 in taxpayer money since May, Huckabee Sanders response was:\n\nThis wasnt White Houseapproved travel. This was done through the general budget at the Department of HHS and I think Secretary Price addressed this over the weekend; theyre conducting both an internal and IG review and all travel on private charter has been suspended until thats completed.\n\nWhen asked about Secretary Carsons disagreement with the president and vice president regarding the runoff Senate election in Alabama  Carson has endorsed Christian Supremacist Roy Moore, while Trump endorsed his opponent Luther Strange  Huckabee Sanders response was:\n\nThe president has a lot of people with a variety of backgrounds and certainly with a variety of opinions. He always welcomes them voicing those.\n\nTrump has, however, made it clear that he does not welcome NFL players voicing their opinions. When asked if President Trump has an issue with the First Amendment, Huckabee Sanders response was:\n\nNot at all. The president is simply stating that pride in our country is a good thing. Its something we should all celebrate; its something that frankly should bring us together, not divide us. Standing up for the national anthem he feels is a symbol of that.\n\nWhen asked if the president was waging a culture war, Huckabee Sanders response was:\n\nNot at all. The presidents not talking about race; the presidents talking about pride in our country."

        "content": "CNN \n\nThe US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russias state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month.\n\nIn the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Departments Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatoms director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.\n\nGoods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests.\n\nThe Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. The plant has frequently been disconnected from Ukraines power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.\n\nWhile the plant is still physically operated by Ukrainian staff, Rosatom manages it. The Energy Department warned Rosatom in the letter that it is unlawful for any Russian citizens or entities to handle the US technology.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rosatom for comment.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Satellite images show changes Russia are making to occupied nuclear plant 03:36 - Source: CNN Satellite images show changes Russia are making to occupied nuclear plant 03:36\n\nIt is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities, the letter says, such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.\n\nIt is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. The Energy Departments National Nuclear Security Administration told CNN in a statement that the letter is authentic.\n\nThe letters were first reported by the news outlet RBC Ukraine.\n\nThe Department of Energys National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate, said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nShe added: The Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorizing the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.\n\nAnother letter from Ferkile to the Energy Departments Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.\n\nThe Energy Departments Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security in Ukraine.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misattributed the news outlet that first reported the letters. It was RBC Ukraine."

        "content": "President Donald Trump expressed mounting frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, promising during a lively cabinet meeting to boost U.S. military aid to Ukraine.\n\nWe get a lot of bull--- thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth, Trump told reporters, who attended a nearly two-hour stretch of the meeting. Hes very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\n\nThe comments echoed his remarks from Monday, when he described himself as not happy and disappointed with Putins actions. The last known conversation between the two leaders was on July 3.\n\nWhen asked about a reported pause for some weapons shipments to Ukraine, Trump seemed to dismiss the idea, saying he wanted to equip brave Ukrainians with defensive arms. Putin is not treating human beings right, he said. Hes killing too many people, so were sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and Ive approved that.\n\nAt last months NATO summit at The Hague, Trump suggested the U.S. was exploring options to send Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine. They do want to have the anti-missile missiles, Trump said of Kyiv at the time. As they call them, the Patriots, and were going to see if we can make some available.\n\nHowever, a subsequent shipment that included dozens of Patriot interceptors capable of defending against incoming Russian missiles was paused over concerns about low U.S. stockpiles, according to two defense officials, two congressional officials and two sources with knowledge of the decision. When pressed on who ordered the pause, Trump responded sharply: I dont know, why dont you tell me?\n\nTrump also said on Tuesday that he was closely eyeing a sanctions bill targeting Russia, saying that he might support it.\n\nU.S. officials had been attempting to broker a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, but negotiations have stalled in recent weeks. Trump had promised to resolve the conflict on the first day of his second term, though he has since claimed he was joking or exaggerating.\n\nThe cabinet meeting, Trumps sixth since taking office, covered a broad range of topics, including the recent Texas floods, tariff negotiations, U.S. strikes on Iran, Hunter Bidens laptop and the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. He also launched into an extended screed about wind farms and a lengthy discussion about the artwork in the room.\n\nTrump also discussed a recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he defended against his ongoing criminal trial. The two plan to meet again to focus on the Gaza conflict.\n\nHes coming over later and were going to be talking about, I would say, almost exclusively, Gaza, Trump said. Its a tragedy. And he wants to get it solved, and I want to get it solved, and I think the other side wants to get it solved.\n\nThe meeting highlighted the absence of Elon Musk, once a key adviser who drove an initiative to streamline government efficiency. Musk, who spent a quarter-billion dollars to help elect Trump in 2024, according to campaign finance reports, has since parted ways with the administration and threatened to launch a third political party, a move that could challenge Republican prospects.\n\nTrump appeared unfazed, responding, I think itll help us.\n\nItll probably third parties have always been good for me, I dont know about Republicans, but for me, the president added."

        "content": "The US economy added 147,000 jobs in June, a sign of continuing strength in the labor market amid Donald Trumps trade war.\n\nThe number of jobs added surpassed expectations, as economists largely anticipated a drop in openings. Instead, 3,000 more jobs were added in June compared with May, according to new job figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The unemployment rate actually decreased to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May.\n\nJob gains were seen in state government and healthcare, which saw increases of 47,000 and 39,000 jobs, respectively. Meanwhile, federal government job losses continued, with another 7,000 roles down in June, as the Trump administration continues to cut jobs. The total job loss in the federal government has been 69,000 since January.\n\nThough the presidents tariffs have rocked the US stock market, which has seen a dramatic rebound after dipping down 15% in the spring, economists have been worrying that the labor market has just been slower to show sensitivity to the tariffs.\n\nNew data had shown employers showing signs of hesitancy. The payroll firm ADP found that the private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, far below the 100,000 increase that was expected, and the first decrease since March 2023.\n\nThe dip in job openings does no necessarily mean companies are laying off more workers; rather, they are creating fewer new positions.\n\nThough layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, in a statement.\n\nJohn Waldron, president of Goldman Sachs, said the American economy was breaking more to the positive than many expected after Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs in early April.\n\nThe US economy is surprisingly resilient, both in terms of consumer spend [and] the labor dynamic, Waldron told reporters on Thursday. And just general economic economic activity is stronger than one might have guessed if you were sitting here on April 3, projecting what the tariff policy would deliver.\n\nData from BLS that measures job openings and turnovers in the labor market found that while job openings had climbed in May, to its highest level since November, the vast majority of openings were concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industry. Economists with Citigroup said the spike in new jobs could be temporary as companies opened new positions in response to Trumps crackdown on immigrants, fearing that immigrant employees could lose work permits.\n\nThe White House has spent the last few months downplaying the impact tariffs have on the domestic economy, despite anxiety from consumers and businesses over the impact tariffs have on prices.\n\nThe deadline for Trumps 90-day pause on some of his highest tariffs is scheduled to expire next week, as the White House tries to broker deals with dozens of countries that could face high tariffs.\n\nThe White House announced on Tuesday a deal with Vietnam, whose products were scheduled to face a 46% tariff. The country agreed to a 20% tariff rate, with no tariffs placed on US exports. The deal with Vietnam follows deals Trump has made with the UK and China, but there are dozens of other countries whose exports could face high tariffs without a deal.\n\nAmid economic uncertainty, Trump has tried to pass blame on to the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell. On Monday, Trump sent an open letter to Powell demanding that the Fed lower interest rates.\n\nHes costing us a fortune because he keeps the rate way up, Trump wrote on social media.\n\nPowell, in turn, has said that the Fed has not lowered interest rates because of economic uncertainty caused by Trumps tariffs.\n\nIn effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, Powell said. Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs."

        "content": "Israel and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since Hamas militants took over the enclave in 2007. Since the most recent war began in 2023, it has been difficult, if not impossible, for people to leave or for food and aid to enter the besieged territory.\n\nMany Palestinians consider the suggestion that even some of Gaza's more than 2 million people be moved as dehumanizing, conjuring painful memories of the Nakba, or catastrophe, the forced removal of an estimated 750,000 Palestinians from their homes when Israel was founded in 1948.\n\nIsrael occupied Gaza from 1967 to 2005, at which point it forcibly removed Jewish settlers from the area.\n\nToday, the resettlement of Palestinians has gone from a fringe idea supported mainly by Netanyahus far-right nationalist coalition partners to something openly entertained by the White House. Some Israeli settler leaders have called for the reoccupation of the territory.\n\nPalestinian leaders have condemned the idea.\n\nWhen they say it would be voluntary, that is so misleading, because when you bomb people every day, when you starve people for 126 days, who can call that a voluntary decision? Mustafa Barghouti, a senior Palestinian politician and head of the Palestinian National Initiative political party, told NBC News on Tuesday.\n\nIn January, when Trump first floated the idea, Washington's allies in the Middle East rejected it.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi called relocating Palestinians an \"injustice\" that would affect his country's security. The same day, Jordans King Abdullah II stressed \"the need to keep the Palestinians on their land and to guarantee their legitimate rights.\" And the Saudi government said it was an \"infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nIn February, U.N. spokesman Stphane Dujarric said that any forced displacement of people is tantamount to ethnic cleansing. While Michael Becker, an assistant professor of international human rights law at Trinity College Dublin, said, \"President Trumps proposal amounts to a blatant rejection of the core tenets of international law that have operated since at least the end of World War II.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on these criticisms.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nResettlement was just one of the topics discussed by Trump and Netanyahu, who, as the latest White House visitor to lavish his host with a flattering accolade, presented the American president with a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. While winning the award has been a longtime ambition of Trump, such nominations have not had an impact in the past on the Nobel Committee's decisions.\n\nTrump expressed optimism about reaching a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas over the war in Gaza, saying things were going along very well and there was no hold-up.\n\nHamas says it responded to Washingtons ceasefire plan with a positive spirit, and Israel has also agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize a 60-day truce, according to Trump.\n\nBut the two sides appear deadlocked over whether the deal would lead to a permanent end to the fighting, rather than just a temporary reprieve. Netanyahu says he wants the full elimination of Hamas, his primary war goal.\n\nDestruction after Israeli attacks on Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City on June 26. Saeed M. M. T. Jaras / Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nMore than 56,000 people have been killed and thousands more seriously injured since Israel launched its military offensive in the Gaza Strip following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, according to health officials in the enclave. About 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage that day in Israel."

        "content": "For years, many Grand Slam finals became, spontaneously, an event. When Rafael Nadal played Roger Federer, or Federer faced Novak Djokovic, or Djokovic took on Andy Murray, and the games stretched into sets, and sets into hours, and morning on the East Coast turned to afternoon, word would spread. Something was happening, something not to be missedsomething precious because it was both rare and recognizable, not least because it kept happening. But then Federer retired, and Murray and Nadal acceded to the inevitable, and there was only Djokovic, chasing his own shadow. The sport, in the United States at least, became something smaller, more niche. But, on a Sunday in early June, tennis was happening again.\n\nThere, in the 2025 French Open final, was the No. 1 player in the world facing the No. 2. An orderly Italian known for his precision and Alpine reserve against a passionate Spaniard. A machine of suffocating reliability against a creative, unpredictable genius. As Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz played deep into the fourth and fifth sets, word spread, just as it used to. Social media lit up. TVs turned on. Texts flew. Even the most hard-core fans, the ones who know how little separates the good from the great, who see brilliant tennis played in an ordinary second round at a smaller event in Metz, struggled to put what they were witnessing into context. Was it the best match since Federer had played Nadal in the 2008 Wimbledon final? Was it better than that? The quality of shotmaking only increased as the pressure went up and up, and time passed, and the reserves depleted. Late in the fourth set, after Alcaraz had already saved three match points, and throughout the fifth, they nailed quick-twitch volleys, raced to drop shots that were dead on the bounce, flung forehands on the run, obliterated the distinction between offense and defense. Finally, the pyrotechnics reached a grand finale, as Alcaraz raced to a 70 lead in the fifth-set tiebreak and finally won the match with a sprinting forehand down the line. Alcarazs tennis during that bout was more than impressive; it was euphoric. And the match had the same old magic, the quality of something new.\n\nAlcaraz knew. I think I have a rival, he had said, after defeating Djokovic to win the 2023 Wimbledon title. Im not afraid to say it. He wasnt talking about the old guardit was Sinner against whom he gauged himself. He and I have already had great battles on all surfaces and in various tournaments, and I believe we will fight together for major titles in the future as well. The tantalizing potential of the rivalry became apparent during a match at the 2022 U.S. Openfeaturing not only long exchanges of bludgeoning ground strokes but feathery drop shots and sharp angles, all-court innovations that obliterated the usual axes between offense and defense, front court and back. Still, it was a surprising thing to say at the time. Alcaraz was already a champion, newly No. 1; Sinner was the eighth seed and, in the semifinals, had been easy prey for Djokovic.\n\nIt has seemed, in a way, as if Alcaraz willed the rivalry into being, even before 2022. Alcaraz, then fifteen years old, faced Sinner, then seventeen, in the Spaniards first-ever professional tennis match; Alcaraz won in three sets. Perhaps that set the stage for him, his sense of what the sport would be. Perhaps he needed it, to focus his ambition. He is an intuitive player, prone to emotional swings; hes at his best when he is happiest, inspired. During matches against other players, he seemed at times to be distracted, irritated, a showman. Against Sinner, he was routinely sublime. Sinner, for his part, played back then a more ordinary baseliners gamepure, clean ball-striking, but hit in predictable patterns. As he ascended the ranking, partly behind a much-improved serve, he added new dimensions to his game, more variation and touch, until only Alcaraz could unsettle him. Last year, Sinners record against all other A.T.P. players was 733. Against Alcaraz, it was 03.\n\nIt is a privilege to share the court with you in every tournament, Alcaraz said to Sinner, on court at Roland Garros, after defeating him for the title. I am just really, really happy to be able to make history with you. Easy for Alcaraz to say, maybe. He won. That the rivalry favors Alcaraz so farhe leads Sinner 84may be one reason he seems so invested in it. But there is another dimension to his frequent references to Sinner, his eagerness to put them on par. Alcaraz took home his first Grand Slam when he was only nineteen years old. He was five when Federer faced Nadal at Wimbledon in that iconic match. He grew up with the Big Three, with the sense that rivalries make history, just as he grew up with light racquets and polyester monofilament strings. For Sinner, who is more consistent than Alcaraz from week to week, the rivalry is humanizing. Sinner, who can come across as robotic and cool, seems to need that, too. Every time when I play against him, I feel, like, that we both try to push ourselves to the limit, Sinner said, in 2023. We hate losing, especially against each other. We have a very good relationship off courtand I feel like we are good friends. But still, you know, on court . . . you feel a little bit nervous. There are limits to that friendship. When Sinner missed three months of the tour after the Australian Open, while serving a doping suspension as part of a settlement for failed drug tests in 2024 (it was judged an accidental contamination), Alcaraz said he was not among those who reached out to him. But, when Alcaraz defeated Sinner in the final of the Rome Open, Sinners first tournament back, Alcaraz had nothing but warm words: Im not gonna get tired of saying how amazing a person, an athlete you are.\n\nHow is it possible that a rivalry this sublime has emerged so soon after the sports golden era? The tennis journalist Giri Nathan has a book, Changeover, about Sinner and Alcaraz that isnt even out yet, but already seems thrillingly historical. The era that they were ushering in isthe ushering is over; were just in it, he told another tennis journalist, Ben Rothenberg. Were in it right now. Perhaps we shouldnt be surprised. Alcarazs game, like Sinners, is built on inheritancesand thats how it should be. From a young age, Sinner and Alcaraz learned to hit ground strokes that dipped and drove, as Nadals did, with clear margins and heavy with spin. They slid into corners, like Djokovic, and learned to hit rally forehands from a full stretch; like Federer, they were not afraid of the net. They kept abreast of the latest recovery science, guarded their rest, treated food as fuel, found coaches who seemed to care for them as people, who fussed over their happiness, who concerned themselves with the fullness of life.\n\nThere are differences between Sinners and Alcarazs games. So far, at least, Alcaraz has looked a little more comfortable on natural surfaces, clay and grass, and Sinner has dominated on hard courts. Alcarazs level has more variance, and his game has more variation. Sinner always comes to play. At the French Open, Sinner won more of the shorter points, while Alcaraz won more points that lasted longer than four shots. But, when they face each other, their games are remarkable not because of the contrasting styles but because of how much they converge.\n\nWhat the players are missing, they can find in the example of each other. Their dynamic seems born not of enmity but something almost more collaborative. Thats true on a technical level, as they improve their games to keep pace and push ahead. Sinner changed his service mechanics, moving from a platform to a pinpoint stance, which helped vault him to the top of the game. Alcaraz changed his serve, too, shoring up what was perhaps the most underdeveloped part of his game. (In the final at Queens Club, leading up to Wimbledon, Alcaraz hit eighteen aces.) And it is true in a more psychological sense as well, encouraging creativity from Sinner, and discipline from Alcaraz. This week is the beginning of Wimbledontenniss most prestigious title. Alcaraz has won the past two years in a row. Part of the glory of sport comes from a constant sense of renewal. The ball is in Sinners court now. "

        "content": "The US is reeling after catastrophic floods killed more than 100 people in Texas, including 27 children and counsellors from an all-girls Christian camp. On Monday, Democrats asked a government watchdog to investigate whether cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) affected the forecasting agencys performance.\n\nBut Republicans default response has been to express fealty to Donald Trump. They lavished praise on the president for providing federal assistance while studiously avoiding questions around the effect of his department of government efficiency (Doge) or threats to dismantle the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).\n\nIt is a sign of the sickness and dysfunction of what was the Republican party that they have almost no thoughts about their constituents, said Rick Wilson, a cofounder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group. Their thoughts are, how do I avoid making sure that Donald Trump doesnt look at me as an enemy or a critic?\n\nDespite the fact that the Doge cuts and the reductions in force and the early buyouts have savaged the workforce of the National Weather Service, they cant even utter the slightest vague, elliptical critique of the administration that is now engaged in these cuts that have cost the lives of the people they supposedly represent.\n\nThe raging flash floods  among the USs worst in decades  slammed into riverside camps and homes in central Texas before daybreak on Friday, pulling sleeping people out of their cabins, tents and trailers and dragging them for miles past floating tree trunks and cars. Some survivors were found clinging to trees. Authorities say the death toll is sure to rise as crews look for the many who are still missing.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have long been criticised for responding to mass shootings with thoughts and prayers, as if the tragedy transcends politics. Similarly, party leaders have sought to blame a freak act of nature rather than contemplating a potential association with Trumps policies  or with the broader threat of the climate crisis, seemingly a taboo subject under the current administration.\n\nGreg Abbott, the governor of Texas, praised Trump for approving a major disaster declaration that ensured state and local government have more resources to deal with the emergency. The swift and very robust action by President Trump is an extraordinary help to our response, he said.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, tweeted Thank you @POTUS Trump for the declaration and told Fox News: The National Weather Service under President Trump has been working to put in new technology and a new system because its been neglected for years. Its an ancient system that needed to be upgraded and so President Trump recognised that right away and got to work on it when he came into office in January.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz wrote on the X social media platform that President Trump committed ANYTHING Texas needs, while telling a press conference: Theres a time to have political fights, theres a time to disagree. This is not that time.\n\nTrump himself has struck a similar tone, deflecting questions about whether he is still planning to phase out Fema. He said he does not plan to re-hire any of the federal meteorologists who were fired this year as part of widespread government spending cuts.\n\nThe president told reporters on Sunday: That water situation, that all is, and that was really the Biden setup. But I wouldnt blame Biden for it, either. I would just say this is a 100-year catastrophe.\n\nBut scrutiny of whether more could have been done to avoid the tragedy is already under way. Texas officials criticised the NWS, arguing that it failed to warn the public about impending danger.\n\nThe NWS defended its forecasting and emergency management, stating that it assigned extra forecasters to the San Antonio and San Angelo offices over the holiday weekend. But a top leadership role at the NWSs San Antonio office has been vacant since earlier this year after Paul Yura accepted an offer from the Trump administration to retire.\n\nDoge, formerly led by the billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has been pushing the NWS to cut jobs and gave hundreds of employees the option to retire early rather than face potential dismissal.\n\nChuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, asked the commerce departments acting inspector general to investigate whether staffing vacancies at the NWSs San Antonio office contributed to delays, gaps, or diminished accuracy in forecasting the flooding. Republicans accused Democrats of seeking to politicise the tragedy.\n\nWilson, a political consultant who has worked on numerous campaigns, said: It is an ongoing family psychodrama inside the Republican party, where everyone is desperately, deeply afraid that they will put a foot wrong with Donald Trump and thats why theres absolutely no candour with these folks about what has happened to the people they represent.\n\nSome commentators suggest that Republicans will ultimately pay a political price for their blind devotion and for last week passing Trumps cost-cutting Big, Beautiful Act.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: Its a vision of the future because every time there is something tragic that happens, not just a natural disaster but a mass shooting or you fill in the blank, somebody is going to find a connection to these deep cuts in government engineered by Trump and Musk.\n\nI think Trump and the Republicans need to get used to this. It may not hurt Trump, but it could potentially and should hurt some of the members of Congress from competitive states and districts that voted for the BBB."

        "content": "In this courtroom sketch, attorney Marc Agnifilo, left, speaks at the podium as Alexandra Shapiro, Sean Combs and attorney Tony Riccio, seated second left to right, listen during a hearing in federal court, Nov. 24, 2024, in New York.\n\nAt its height, Sean Diddy Combs Bad Boy Entertainment was a show business powerhouse, mixing music, video, fashion, liquor and style into an enterprise that made Combs a billionaire.\n\nCombs won praise for his visionary growth and brand management.\n\nBut federal prosecutors have another description for Bad Boy: a racketeering operation.\n\nThe federal trial in New York City includes an allegation that Combs was involved in mob family-style racketeering with coercion, kidnapping, threats and beatings done to cover up a pattern of sexual assaults, sex trafficking and prostitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mogul has publicly and defiantly maintained his innocence even before his arrest in September.\n\nThe federal indictment alleges that Combs and his associates lured female victims, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Combs then allegedly used force, threats of force, coercion and controlled substances to get women to engage in sex acts with male prostitutes while he occasionally watched in gatherings that Combs referred to as freak-offs. Combs gave the women ketamine, ecstasy and GHB to keep them obedient and compliant during the performances, prosecutors say.\n\nCombs alleged criminal enterprise threatened and abused women and utilized members of his enterprise to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice, prosecutors said. In bringing so-called RICO charges, prosecutors in opening statements said Combs was helped by a cadre of company employees, security staff and aides. They allegedly helped organize the freak-offs and then covered up the incidents. Thus far, Combs is the only one facing criminal charges related to the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave prosecutors made the case?\n\nWhat the prosecution has presented\n\nProsecutors have so far called nearly 30 witnesses to the stand in Manhattan and are expected to finish up with witnesses this week.\n\nThey include three women who described graphic sexual assaults, including a woman the defense acknowledged was the key witness, Combs onetime lover, Casandra Cassie Ventura. It was Venturas lawsuit in 2023 that set off the unraveling of the Combs enterprise with its details of sex, violence and freak-offs.\n\nHis last former girlfriend, referred to only as Jane in court, described how the freak-offs and coerced sex continued despite the lawsuit and a raid by Homeland Security Investigations until his arrest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe texted Combs pages of Venturas lawsuit immediately after it was filed.\n\nIve been crying for three days and am under stress from reading all of this. I keep having nightmares about forced nights and all the times I felt like I couldnt say no. I feel like Im reading my own sexual trauma, she wrote, according to Legal Affairs and Trials.\n\nOn another occasion, she said she texted his chief of staff about the threats he made, writing, He just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has of me on two phones. He said that he would expose me and send them to my childs father.\n\nJane is one of three women whose testimony is at the center of the trial, the others being Ventura and a former employee testifying under the pseudonym Mia, who also testified she was sexually assaulted.\n\nWas Bad Boy a criminal enterprise?\n\nUnder the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, there are 35 specific offenses, including kidnapping, murder, bribery and extortion, and federal prosecutors need to show a pattern involving at least two overt acts as part of a criminal enterprise.\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, said that to prove RICO, the prosecution must show the existence of not just criminal activity but an actual criminal enterprise.\n\nPeople typically think of the mob, street gangs or drug cartels. But any loose association of two or more people is enough, like Combs entourage, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also have to show a pattern of racketeering or two or more RICO predicate acts over a 10-year period.\n\nThats why the evidence of bribery, kidnapping, obstruction, witness tampering and prostitution is important to the prosecutions case, she said.\n\nIt will be up to jurors to determine if federal prosecutors proved the RICO charge.\n\nR&B singer Ventura, who had a long relationship with Combs, was an early key witness in the prosecutions case.\n\nVentura testified she felt trapped in a cycle of physical and sexual abuse by him, and that the relationship involved 11 years of alleged beatings, sexual blackmail and a rape.\n\nShe claimed Combs threatened to leak videos of her sexual encounters with numerous male sex workers while drug-intoxicated and glistening with baby oil as he watched and orchestrated the freak-offs.\n\nOne of those freak-offs led to an infamous hotel beating, Ventura testified. Video footage from that March 2016 night shows Combs punching and kicking Ventura as she cowers and tries to protect herself in front of an L.A. hotel elevator bank. He then drags her down the hall by her hooded sweatshirt toward their hotel room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA second angle from another camera captures Combs throwing a vase toward her. She suffered bruising to her eye, a fat lip and a bruise that prosecutors showed was still visible during a movie premiere two days later, where she donned sunglasses and heavy makeup on the red carpet.\n\nA cover-up then ensued, according to prosecutors. Ventura stated that the police visited her apartment. She answered a few of their questions, but told the jury she still wanted to protect Combs at the time.\n\nI would not say who I was talking about, she told the jury. In that moment, I did not want to hurt him in that way. There was too much going on. It was a lot.\n\nEddie Garcia, the InterContinental Hotel security guard, testified that Combs gave him a brown paper bag containing $100,000 in cash for the video.\n\nGarcia said after his supervisor agreed to sell the video recording, he met with Combs, Combs chief of staff Kristina Khorram and a bodyguard. After Garcia raised concerns about the police, he said Combs called Ventura on FaceTime, handed him the phone and told Ventura to tell Garcia that she also wanted the video to go away. After that, Garcia said he took the money and split it with co-workers.\n\nCapricorn Clark, a former assistant to Combs, recalled a 2011 violent incident with Combs.\n\nClark told jurors Combs forced her from her apartment at gunpoint to go with him to musician Kid Cudis home in December 2011. Once there, Combs and Clark entered the empty house, and then Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, showed up. To avoid getting law enforcement involved, Clark testified, Combs ordered her to call Ventura, who was at that time Combs ex-girlfriend, and said they need to convince Cudi not to snitch to the cops. If you guys dont convince him of that, Ill kill all you m, Clark quoted Combs saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCudi testified that his Porsche was later firebombed in his driveway with a Molotov cocktail.\n\nVentura wasnt Combs only alleged sex crime victim. Mia, an assistant testifying under that name, described years of sexual abuse, rape and threats. Combs, she said, first sexually assaulted her at his 40th birthday party in New York in 2009, shortly after she began working for him. In the year that followed, she slept in a bedroom at his home, where she was not allowed to lock the door. Through tears, she testified he raped her. I was frozen. I didnt react. I was terrified and confused and ashamed and scared. Another alleged attack occurred in a bedroom closet where she said Combs grabbed her head and forced her to perform oral sex on him.\n\nUnder cross-examination, she said she did not initially tell federal prosecutors that Combs sexually assaulted her and acknowledged sending Combs loving messages in the years after the alleged attacks.\n\nJane, his most recent ex-girlfriend, described how she endured drug-fueled sex marathons right up until the hip-hop titans arrest.\n\nBryana Bongolan, a friend of Ventura, testified that Combs dangled her over a 17-story balcony and tossed her onto balcony furniture in September 2016.\n\nI will never forget him holding me on that balcony, she said as a defense lawyer challenged the date she provided with evidence of Combs being elsewhere at a hotel across the country."

While these tools have potential to change the way people work and create, some have also raised concerns about how they could be use to deceive by impersonating individuals.\n\nEven as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said.\n\nThroughout the FTCs history we have had to adapt our enforcement to changing technology, said FTC Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter. Our obligation is to do what weve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies  [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.\n\nFTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box.\n\nOur staff has been consistently saying our unfair and deceptive practices authority applies, our civil rights laws, fair credit, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, those apply, said Bedoya. There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.\n\nThe FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tools capabilities and limitations."

        "content": "Haiti's gangs have 'near-total control' of the capital, U.N. says\n\ntoggle caption Odelyn Joseph/AP\n\nUNITED NATIONS  Haiti's gangs have gained \"near-total control\" of the capital and authorities are unable to stop escalating violence across the impoverished Caribbean nation, senior U.N. officials warned Wednesday.\n\nAn estimated 90% of the capital\n\nPort-au-Prince is now under control of criminal groups who are expanding attacks not only into surrounding areas but beyond into previously peaceful areas, Ghada Fathy Waly, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, told the U.N. Security Council.\n\n\"Southern Haiti, which until recently was insulated from the violence, has seen a sharp increase in gang-related incidents,\" she said. \"And in the east, criminal groups are exploiting land routes, including key crossings like Belladere and Malpasse, where attacks against police and customs officials have been reported.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWaly said the state's authority to govern is rapidly shrinking as gang control expands with cascading effects. Criminal groups are stepping into the vacuum left by the absence or limited delivery of public services and are establishing \"parallel governance structures,\" and gang control of major trade routes has paralyzed legal commerce, leading to soaring prices for cooking fuel and rice, Haiti's staple food, she said.\n\nU.N. Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenca told the council \"the ongoing gang encirclement of Port-au-Prince\" and their strengthened foothold in the capital and beyond is \"pushing the situation closer to the brink.\"\n\n\"Without increased action by the international community, the total collapse of state presence in the capital could become a very real scenario,\" he warned.\n\nGangs have grown in power since the assassination of President Jovenel Mose in July 2021 and previously were estimated to control 85% of the capital. Haiti has not had a president since the assassination.\n\nA U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti last year to help quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' proposal in February to have the U.N. provide drones, fuel, ground and air transport and other non-lethal support to the Kenya-led mission has languished in the council.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn response to the gangs, the UNODC's Waly said there has been a rapid growth in the number and activities of private security companies and vigilante self-defense groups, with some trying to protect their communities while others act illegally and collude with gangs.\n\n\"Over the last three months,\" Jenca said, \"these groups reportedly killed at least 100 men and one woman suspected of gang association or collaboration.\"\n\nHe said the last three months have also seen an increase in sexual violence by gangs with the U.N. political mission in Haiti documenting 364 incidents of sexual violence involving 378 survivors just from March to April.\n\nA new report by U.N. experts covering the period from last October through February said the gangs have exploited political turmoil and the disorganized response to Haiti's security crisis, pointing to competing political ambitions and allegations of corruption within Haiti's transitional governing bodies that have stymied action.\n\n\"While the expansion of territorial control brings gangs additional sources of revenue and bargaining power,\" the experts said, \"these attacks are also backed by individuals trying to destabilize the political transition for their own political goals.\"\n\nOne major result is that very little progress has been made toward restoring public security or implementing the roadmap for organizing national elections by February 2026, the experts monitoring an arms embargo on Haiti and sanctions against key gang leaders said in the report to the Security Council.\n\nWith a weak national police force facing acute tensions in its leadership, an army that needs rebuilding, and the limited ability of the multinational force, the experts warned that the gangs will continue \"to have the upper hand unless stronger international support is provided.\"\n\nAs for vigilante groups, the experts said, they \"often include local police officers, some of whom actively participate in human rights violations.\"\n\nThe Haitian National Police have also carried out \"a worrying number of extrajudicial killings  with suspected gang members often summarily executed,\" the experts said, pointing to 281 summary executions by specialized police units in 2024 including 22 women and 8 children.\n\nDespite the U.N. arms embargo on Haiti, gangs continue to obtain more powerful weapons not only from regional civilian markets but from police stockpiles in Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic, the experts said.\n\n"

        "content": "Sentenced to life in prison nearly three decades ago, Erik and Lyle Menendez could have a shot at freedom as Los Angeles prosecutors comb through new evidence.\n\nIn a Thursday news conference, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascn shared that attorneys for the Menendezes had provided new evidence in a petition and asked the court to vacate their convictions. Gascn announced a Nov. 29 hearing on potential resentencing .\n\nWe have not decided on an outcome. We are reviewing information, Gascn said, per CNN, adding that his office wasnt certain of the validity of the new evidence. We will evaluate all of it.\n\nThe pair killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989. They were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 on their second murder trial. That trial famously forbade the use of most evidence detailing possible abuse of the brothers, a move that has long inspired criticism from criminal justice advocates including Kim Kardashian. The new evidence includes a letter from Erik Menendez that his attorneys believe backs up the brother's claims of long-term sexual abuse by his father.\n\nErik and Lyle Menendez have long been vocal about the abuse they experienced at the hands of their father, Jose, a factor they say should have played into their sentencing.\n\nCliff Gardner, an attorney for the Menendez brothers, celebrated the news in an email to the Associated Press.\n\nGiven todays very different understanding of how sexual and physical abuse impacts children  both boys and girls  and the remarkable new evidence, we think resentencing is the appropriate result, Gardner reportedly wrote. The brothers have served more than 30 years in prison. That is enough.\n\nThe duo are back in the limelight due to a Ryan Murphy-created Netflix series dramatizing their case: \"Monsters: The Lyle And Erik Menendez Story.\" Erik criticized the series in a post to Facebook last month."

        "content": "With Indus Waters Treaty in the balance, Pakistan braces for more water woes\n\ntoggle caption Betsy Joles for NPR\n\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan  High in the Himalayas, the Indus River flows over the Tibetan Plateau before branching into a web of tributaries that stretch through India and Pakistan and converge to empty into the Arabian Sea. For more than six decades, this river network has been divided between the two countries according to the Indus Waters Treaty, which broadly allocates three rivers each to India and Pakistan.\n\nThe treaty has survived wars and periods of tense diplomacy between these hostile neighbors. But in April, after India blamed Pakistan for an attack in which militants killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir, the Indian government announced it would no longer abide by it. In doing so, it has thrown Pakistan's already-shaky water situation into deeper uncertainty.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis was one of several retaliatory measures India took after the April attack, which Pakistan denies any involvement in. It marks the first time either country suspended the World Bank-negotiated water-sharing treaty since they signed it in 1960. Now the treaty is a possible flashpoint that could disrupt fragile peace in the region again.\n\nSince a U.S.-negotiated ceasefire went into effect in May, India has insisted the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan stops supporting what it calls cross-border terrorism. India's Home Minister Amit Shah vowed that India will \"never\" restore the Indus Waters Treaty, telling an Indian newspaper, \"Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.\"\n\nPakistan in turn accuses India of \"weaponizing water\" and says it will consider any attempts by India to divert or cut water in abrogation of the treaty an act of war.\n\nThe two countries have yet to hold diplomatic talks about the treaty's future. In Pakistan, its continued suspension is a reminder of the real threat of water scarcity.\n\n\"Everyone is on the same page that water is the lifeline of Pakistan, and no one will allow anyone to stop it,\" says Aamer Hayat Bhandara, a farmer in Punjab province's Pakpattan district and member of a provincial agriculture commission.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nExperts say threats to water have an outsize impact in Pakistan because so much of its agriculture is supported by the Indus and its tributaries.\n\n\"For Pakistan, it is existential,\" says Adil Najam, a professor of international relations and of earth and environment at the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University. \"The red line is there not because water is some mythical thing, but because Pakistan is essentially a dry country.\"\n\ntoggle caption Betsy Joles for NPR\n\ntoggle caption Betsy Joles for NPR\n\nWill India withhold water?\n\nThe Indus Basin irrigates around 80% of Pakistan's arid land, according to Pakistani government estimates. Agriculture supports around two-thirds of its population. Water from the Indus Basin helps replenish aquifers that provide groundwater for homes and industries in Pakistan's major cities. Rivers in the Indus system generate hydroelectric power, which accounted for 28% of the country's electricity last year.\n\nThe Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) allows India to build hydroelectric dams on the three western rivers allotted to Pakistan  the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab  as long as the dams are \"run-of-the-river,\" which means they have little or no capacity for water storage. This limits India's ability to build new dams that would withhold substantial amounts of water from Pakistan.\n\nIndia has already built several dams on these rivers for hydroelectric power generation. Two projects, the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric power plants, have been a source of contention over the years, with India and Pakistan disagreeing over whether certain design elements are allowed by the treaty. Late last month, the Hague-based, treaty-mandated arbitration tribunal involved in dispute resolution said it still has jurisdiction over the ongoing Kishanganga and Ratle dispute, despite India's declaration that it is holding the treaty in abeyance. But India rejected the court's authority.\n\nAshok Swain, a professor of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden, says India's suspension of the treaty is primarily meant to send a message to Pakistan. \"At present, I think it's just political showmanship,\" he says, adding that the likelihood of either country resorting to military action over water for the time being is low. \"Pakistanis and Indians very well know that once you attack each other's dams, it will be a huge, huge catastrophe.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSwain believes both countries will return eventually to the agreement. \"Given the relationship and lack of trust between these two countries, this is the best we have.\"\n\nBut for now, some analysts suggest, the treaty's suspension may still present an opportunity for India  which had been pushing for a greater share of water from the Indus Basin long before this year's tensions erupted  to move forward on its own terms.\n\n\"India considers the IWT unfair and heavily skewed in favour of Pakistan,\" Maharaj Krishan Pandit, a researcher of Himalayan ecology, conservation and sustainability and Ngee Ann Kongsi Distinguished Professor at the National University of Singapore, tells NPR via email. He says the impacts of climate change provide India with an objective reason to renegotiate the 1960 treaty.\n\ntoggle caption Betsy Joles for NPR\n\nIndia is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, according to the World Bank, with extreme heat and increasingly erratic monsoon patterns making matters worse.\n\nPandit says India could take several actions  including some immediate ones  to retain and redistribute water within its own territory, such as using existing dams, building diversion structures or adding infrastructure to ongoing dam projects without getting Pakistan's nod.\n\n\"Given the long-term demand, it looks quite plausible that India may go ahead and execute these projects,\" Pandit says, adding that he isn't privy to any concrete plans to do so.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the Indian government is weighing the possibility of expanding a canal on the Chenab, one of the rivers allocated to Pakistan. (India controls the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers).\n\nPakistan's leadership has warned against any Indian infrastructure projects that would violate the terms of the Indus treaty. Beyond this, it sees no justification for India's move to put the treaty in abeyance.\n\n\"The government of Pakistan does not recognize that this treaty has been put in abeyance because there's no provision for that,\" says Musadik Malik, Pakistan's climate change minister.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke recently about plans to speed up construction on one of his country's dams, and invited provincial discussions on how to increase the country's water storage capacity after India suspended the treaty. Pakistan is also contemplating a new tax to help finance the completion of new dams.\n\nMalik says Pakistan is ready to discuss the treaty with India but warns it will fight actions to withhold water  responding even more firmly than it did to India's military actions in May. \"We're going to use diplomatic channels. And if a war [over water] is imposed on us, then we would do exactly what we did in this round, plus one.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNBC-TV18 in India in May, World Bank President Ajay Banga said there is no provision in the treaty to allow for its suspension and that any changes require both India and Pakistan to agree.\n\ntoggle caption Betsy Joles for NPR\n\ntoggle caption Betsy Joles for NPR\n\nPakistan's fights over water are internal as well as with India\n\nThe Indus Waters Treaty was brokered by the World Bank to address the question of water sharing, crucial to agriculture in the region  which is now home to around 1.6 billion people. The treaty includes mechanisms for dispute resolution, which both India and Pakistan have used over the years to bring up complaints over technical details and differing interpretations of the treaty's language.\n\nIn 2023, India informed Pakistan that it wanted to modify the treaty. It requested modification again in 2024, citing demographic changes and environmental challenges, according to Indian media. Pakistan has not agreed to modify the treaty.\n\nPakistan and India are both suffering from climate stress, and scientists say the Himalayan region where the Indus originates is warming faster than many other places in the world. This warming is leading to glacial retreat, putting additional strain on an overstretched Indus Basin. Both countries rely heavily on groundwater, the availability of which is also declining rapidly as populations grow.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEven before the latest tensions, water was already a major concern in Pakistan. Protests started late last year in the southern Sindh province over the federal government's plan to build canals on the Indus, including one to irrigate farmland in the Cholistan desert in Punjab province. The plan  part of a larger army-led corporate farming project called the Green Pakistan Initiative  was pitched as a way to make Pakistan's outdated agriculture sector more efficient.\n\nThe canal project sparked opposition, especially in Sindh province, where agricultural communities complain they don't get their fair share of water from neighboring Punjab.\n\n\"We are experiencing water shortages all the time. So if anybody is going to tell us there's going to be additional demand for water that is being created upstream, it raises eyebrows,\" said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, a landowning farmer who grows sugarcane, vegetables and mangoes on his 550 acres in Sindh's Tando Allahyar district.\n\ntoggle caption Betsy Joles for NPR\n\nHe says the canals project is a more immediate threat to farms than the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. \"That will essentially be [the] deathbed for Sindh. That's how people see it.\"\n\nPakistan's leadership denies that Sindh is denied its fair share of water. But it paused the canals project after India announced its suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Prime Minister Sharif said the project would resume only with consensus from the provinces."

        "content": "A firefighter calls out to his colleagues at the scene of an explosion in a residential compound in northern Tehran on Friday.\n\nIran launched successive missile barrages on Israel late Friday, a retaliation for a punishing Israeli campaign the same day that wiped out the upper echelons of Irans military leadership along with important parts of its nuclear and military infrastructure.\n\nThe exchanges constituted the most significant escalation between the longtime adversaries  raising the possibility of a protracted conflict and fears the U.S. would become embroiled in another war in the Middle East.\n\nSirens echoed in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, with the nighttime skies over the latter lighted with bursts of yellow as missiles from Israels Arrow defense system lanced up to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles. The bass-drum beat of multiple explosions could be heard as far away as neighboring Jordan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroadcasts from Tel Aviv showed a residential tower with fire raging inside a number of apartments, while other video showed smoke wreathing several buildings in central parts of the city and missiles falling on empty intersections.\n\nVideos from Iran and published on social media depicted fire and visible damage to several residential buildings in Tehran. Others showed entire buildings having collapsed, with rubble carpeting the street. One image  The Times could not verify its authenticity  showed a bloodied child lying on a debris-covered floor.\n\nIsraeli officials said more than 40 people were wounded and that rescue crews were examining nine reported impact sites in central Israel. In Iran, news outlets reported 78 dead and more than 320 wounded in Israels attacks, which also struck residential areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least five people, including three children, were injured by shrapnel from a missile that fell near the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday evening, according to WAFA, the official Palestinian Authority news service. The Israeli military, which said the missile that fell in the area came from Yemen, said no interceptors were launched.\n\nIrans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement that Iranian forces conducted a crushing and precise response against dozens of targets, military centers and airbases in Israel.\n\nThey started this and now theyve launched a war, said Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a statement, adding that Israel would not be allowed to conduct what he called hit-and-run attacks without grave consequences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Iranian nation must be sure that our response will not be half-measured.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Iran crossed red lines after it dared to fire missiles at civilian population concentrations in Israel.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel acted to thwart the Islamic regimes nuclear and ballistic missile threat to us, adding, more is on the way. The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them.\n\nIsrael launched a compound operation involving some 200 warplanes and drones hitting more than 100 nuclear sites, ballistic missile factories and other military areas across the country, including in Natanz  home to Irans main nuclear enrichment facility  along with Kermanshah, Tabriz and Isfahan.\n\nPresident Trump lauded Israels operation, describing it in an interview with ABC News as excellent and warning more attacks would be forthcoming if Irans leadership did not negotiate a new nuclear deal.\n\nI think its been excellent, Trump said. We gave them a chance and they didnt take it. They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as youre going to get hit. And theres more to come. A lot more.\n\nExplosions began to rock Tehran shortly after 3 a.m., with blasts reported in the Iranian capitals central, northeastern and northwestern neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIranian protesters hold up Iranian and Palestinian flags in an anti-Israeli gathering in Tehran on Friday. (Vahid Salemi / Associated Press)\n\nIrans Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Israels campaign was a declaration of war, adding in a letter to the United Nations  and later published on his Telegram channel  that the U.N. Security Council should immediately address this issue.\n\nThe strikes proved to be a devastating blow to Irans top military leadership and a demonstration of Israels intelligence infiltration, hitting senior members of Irans chain of command in their homes.\n\nIranian state and local media confirmed the death of Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian armed forces chief of staff; Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; Maj. Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid, an IRGC commander who heads the armys central headquarters; and Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Forces. Also killed were veteran nuclear scientists Fereydoon Abbasi, Abdolhamid Minoucher and Mohammad-Mehdi Tehranchi, according to the semiofficial Iranian outlet Press TV.\n\nAli, a resident living a few blocks away from one of the targeted sites who gave only his first name to avoid harassment, was praying when he heard huge explosions around him.\n\nThe floor started shaking, so I stopped praying and ran outside, he said. He went down the street and found smoke coming out of the second floor of a six-story building, with people shouting on the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, an official with Israels Mossad said in an interview with Israeli daily newspaper Times of Israel that the spy agency smuggled vehicles carrying weapons systems and constructed a secret explosive drone base in Iran ahead of the operation. The official added that the swarm of explosive drones was used to destroy ballistic missile launchers to cripple Irans ability to thwart the strikes.\n\nBehrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, said in an interview on state TV that there were no casualties and that initial assessments showed that damage to Natanz was superficial. He added that there was no external contamination.\n\nIranian worshipers attend an anti-Israeli rally under a portrait of the late revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after their Friday prayers in Tehran on Friday. (Vahid Salemi / Associated Press)\n\nIrans leadership said Fridays attacks were only the start of their retaliation.\n\nYet it remains unclear how Tehran can make good on that threat. In the past, it could rely on a network of militias and sympathetic governments in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Gaza that were collectively known as the Axis of Resistance.\n\nBut the last 20 months have seen Israel systematically cripple the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, while the fall of Iranian ally Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied Tehran a passageway to Israels borders; its Iraqi militia allies have kept a low profile in recent months and Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are facing their own wide-ranging offensives in Gaza. And previous ballistic missile and drone barrages by Iran and Yemens Houthis have had little impact on Israels defenses.\n\nHours after the initial Israeli strikes, crowds streamed into Tehrans streets, calling for revenge and chanting Death to Israel. Death to America. Others queued before gas stations and supermarkets, preparing for what they thought would be a long war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Iranian drones winged their way to Israel, Jordan warned citizens to keep indoors and avoid open areas. Later, sirens sounded in Amman, even as the missiles and the interceptors rising to meet them could be seen in the skies over the Jordanian capital. Jordanian jets scrambled to shoot down some of the projectiles flying through the countrys airspace, after assessments said the missiles were likely to fall on Jordanian territory, the Jordanian military said.\n\nIn the initial hours after the strike, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to distance the U.S. from Israels attacks, describing them as a unilateral action that Israel believed was necessary for its self-defense.\n\nBut that messaging was likely undercut by Trumps statements putting pressure on Irans leadership to continue negotiating.\n\nI gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to just do it, but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldnt get it done... They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse! Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. He added that, Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak candidly, told The Times that the Iranians had reached out to Trump administration officials after the Israeli strike  a sign, to them, of the success of the Israeli operation and of desperation in Tehran. But it is unclear what will be left to discuss regarding Irans nuclear program, the official added.\n\nItll be hard to break out, the official said, referring to the sprint from fissile material to warheads, if you have no nuclear infrastructure left.\n\nNetanyahu, in a televised address, appealed to the Iranian people, saying now was the time for them to rise up against repressive leaders. This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard. Woman, Life, Freedom  Zan, Zendegi, Azadi, Netanyahu said, employing the slogan of anti-government protests in Iran.\n\nThe U.S. Navy repositioned some of its forces in anticipation of Irans retaliatory attacks. The USS Thomas Hudner, a guided missile destroyer, was dispatched to the eastern Mediterranean while another destroyer was made available if requested by the White House, according to two U.S. officials speaking to the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsraels operation spurred a raft of condemnations from regional countries. Saudi Arabias foreign ministry denounced the heinous Israeli attacks against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nOman, the main mediator between the U.S. and Iran in recent months, said the attacks were unacceptable and ongoing aggressive behaviour that undermines the foundations of stability in the region.\n\nIn a statement, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint to avoid descent into deeper conflict.\n\nTrump insisted that there was still a chance for diplomacy.\n\nTwo months ago I gave Iran a 60-day ultimatum to make a deal. They should have done it! Today is day 61, he wrote in a post on Truth Social.\n\nI told them what to do, but they just couldnt get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!\n\nTimes staff writer Michael Wilner contributed to this report from Washington.\n\n"

        "content": "WASHINGTON  For U.S. presidents, meeting the families of military personnel killed in war is about as wrenching as the presidency gets. President Donald Trumps suggestion Monday that his predecessors fell short in that duty brought a visceral reaction from those who witnessed those grieving encounters.\n\nHes a deranged animal, Alyssa Mastromonaco, a former deputy chief of staff to President Barack Obama, tweeted about Trump. With an expletive, she called Trumps statement in the Rose Garden a lie.\n\nTrump said in a news conference he had written letters to the families of four soldiers killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger and planned to call them, crediting himself with taking extra steps in honoring the dead properly. Most of them didnt make calls, he said of his predecessors. He said its possible that Obama did sometimes but other presidents did not call.\n\nThe record is plain that presidents reached out to families of the dead and to the wounded, often with their presence as well as by letter and phone. The path to Walter Reed and other military hospitals, as well as to the Dover, Delaware, Air Force Base where the remains of fallen soldiers are often brought, is a familiar one to Obama, George W. Bush and others.\n\nBush, even at the height of two wars, wrote all the families of the fallen, said Freddy Ford, spokesman for the ex-president. Ford said Bush also called or met hundreds, if not thousands of family members of the war dead.\n\nREAD MORE: What Trump said about his drug czar pick, health care fixes\n\nObamas official photographer, Pete Souza, tweeted that he photographed Obama meeting with hundreds of wounded soldiers, and family members of those killed in action. Others recalled his frequent visits with Gold Star families, and travels to Walter Reed, Dover and other venues with families of the dead and with the wounded.\n\nRetired Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed these contacts, tweeting: POTUS 43 & 44 and first ladies cared deeply, worked tirelessly for the serving, the fallen, and their families. Not politics. Sacred Trust.\n\nTrump addressed the matter when asked why he had not spoken about the four soldiers killed in Niger. They died when militants thought to be affiliated with the Islamic State group ambushed them while they were patrolling in unarmored trucks with Nigerien troops.\n\nI actually wrote letters individually to the soldiers were talking about, and theyre going to be going out either today or tomorrow, he said, meaning he wrote to the families of the fallen soldiers. He did not explain why letters had not been sent yet, more than a week after the attack.\n\nIf you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didnt make calls, Trump said.\n\nPressed on that statement later, he said of Obama: I was told that he didnt often, and a lot of presidents dont. They write letters. He went on: President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didnt. I dont know. Thats what I was told.  Some presidents didnt do anything.\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later that Trump wasnt criticizing predecessors, but stating a fact. She argued that presidents didnt always call families of those killed in battle: Sometimes they call, sometimes they send a letter, other times they have the opportunity to meet family members in person.\n\nShe said anyone claiming a former president had called every family was mistaken.\n\nBushs commitment to writing to all military families of the dead and to reaching out by phone or meeting with many others came despite the enormity of the task. In the Iraq war alone, U.S. combat deaths were highest during his presidency, exceeding 800 each year from 2004 through 2007. The number fell to 313 in Bushs last year in office as the insurgency faded. Bush once said he felt the appropriate way to show his respect was to meet family members in private.\n\nREAD MORE: What the Bannon vs. McConnell fight means for Trump and the GOP\n\nObama declared an end to combat operations in Iraq in August 2010 and the last U.S. troops were withdrawn in December 2011. As Obama wound down that war, he sent tens of thousands more troops into Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010, and the death count mounted. From a total of 155 Americans killed in Afghanistan in 2008, which was Bushs last full year in office, the number jumped to 311 in 2009 and peaked the next year at 498. In all, more than 1,700 died in Afghanistan on Obamas watch.\n\nAmong other rituals honoring military families, the Obamas had a Gold Star Christmas tree in the White House decorated with hundreds of photos and notes from people who had lost loved ones in war. Gold Star families visited during the holidays, bringing ornaments.\n\nTrump visited Dover early in his presidency, going in February with his daughter Ivanka for the return of the remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed during a raid in Yemen, William Ryan Owens.\n\nTrumps relations with Gold Star families have not always been smooth, dating from his belittlement of the parents of slain U.S. soldier Humayun Khan, who was Muslim. Trump was angered when the soldiers father, Khizr Khan, was given a platform to criticize him at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nOwens grieving father said he didnt want to talk with Trump at Dover. But the sailors widow, Carryn, attended Trumps address to Congress and wept as he thanked her.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Jesse J. Holland contributed to this report."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "A hacking team reportedly linked to the Russian government has been utilizing a security flaw in a Google service to launch attacks on investigative journalists. The web giant knew about the vulnerability and took some measures to fix it but without disclosing what they were so that they could be subjected to peer-review.\n\nThe security bug lies within Googles implementation of a new internet standard it has been trying to promote called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Google has marketed AMP as a way of optimizing web pages for smartphones. Launched in late 2015, AMP is designed to provide simpler versions of websites that can load faster on the often slower data connections and microprocessors used by mobile devices.\n\nTo further speed things up for smartphone users, Google preloads copies of AMP pages listed in search results so they can be instantly loaded if they are subsequently clicked. The only way this background loading of pages can be accomplished is to give the cached pages Google.com URLs.\n\nSuch pre-rendered AMP pages created by Google show the originating domain at the top of the webpage content area. But within a mobile web browsers address bar  at the very top of the screen  they nonetheless appear to be from Googles website. Furthermore, the disclaimer showing where the page actually originates will disappear as the user scrolls down the page, while the Google address will not. This effect can be seen in the video below.\n\nThanks to heavy promotional efforts by Google, AMP has been widely adopted. But it has also remained controversial within the web publishing industry. Primarily, its critics have raised concerns that AMP pages obfuscate true URLs, limit the interface that sites can present to their readers, and encourage searchers to never leave the Google site.\n\nWhy would any website turn their entire mobile audience  a majority share of their total audience, for many sites today  over to Google? well-known blogger and programmer John Gruber wrote shortly after AMP was unveiled.\n\nOther technical-minded critics of AMP have noticed its potential for abuse by junk websites. Since AMP webpages can be accessed via Google addresses, they appear more credible than random domain names or blog hosting sites like WordPress.\n\nIn December, tech journalist Kyle Chayka also noted that AMP and Facebooks competing Instant Articles feature allow junk websites that publish nonsense or conspiracy theories to share many of the same visual features as legitimate news sites. All publishers end up looking more similar than different. That makes separating the real from the fake even harder.\n\nGoogle AMP is bad news for how the web is built, its bad news for publishers of credible online content, and its bad news for consumers of that content, computer book publisher Scott Gilbertson wrote earlier this year in an essay titled Kill Google AMP before it KILLS the web.\n\nBeyond its potential for abuse by dishonest web publishers, Googles approach to caching AMP webpages and providing Google.com addresses for them is a prime target for cyber-criminals who steal account information using a technique known as phishing. Most computer users have encountered this at some point: Fake security alerts designed to look like messages from legitimate companies, inviting targets to visit plausible-looking websites set up solely for the purpose of capturing passwords.\n\nSince phishing has become much more common, network administrators have made a habit of telling users never to click on password reset links that go to different domains. Because of the way that Google has implemented AMP, however, Gmail users and people using Google apps for institutional use are now more vulnerable to such attacks. Phishers who use AMP pages can thereby employ official google.com web addresses to direct users to malicious sites.\n\nThis is a serious bug in my opinion, web programmer Ray Etornam wrote to Google, in a report he filed last November on the software development site Github discussing how fake news publishers can use AMP to gain legitimacy. Commenting on the report that Etornam had submitted, another developer named Christian Gloddy repeatedly tried to warn Google about the security implications of its AMP implementation.\n\nThe most common advice to avoid phishing and scams is check the domain in the address bar. Not at the text that might be below the address bar, he wrote in one comment.\n\nMultiple other developers underscored that warning to Google even as Malte Ubl, the company employee in charge of AMP, pushed back insistently against the criticism. The Google Search viewer clearly attributes the original domain at the top, he wrote. I dont agree that an unsophisticated user could be fooled by this.\n\nUbls defenses were unpersuasive to the developers he was trying to convince, however.\n\nI think this issue is going to bite Google when least expected and in a very public and negative way, John Pettitt, co-founder of a credit card payment system called CyberSource, wrote in the discussion thread.\n\n* . * . *\n\nWhile Google was busy defending its AMP implementation, hackers affiliated with the cyber-criminal group sometimes referred to as Fancy Bear, Strontium or APT28 were busy exploiting these very same flaws to try to steal passwords from Gmail users.\n\nFrequently associated with Russian government intelligence operators, Fancy Bears hackers had accrued a legendary reputation even before they were alleged to have participated in a series of cyberattacks against organizations affiliated with the Democratic Party last year. According to Microsoft executive vice president Terry Myerson, Fancy Bear was responsible for more viruses utilizing previously unknown vulnerabilities than any other hacking confederation.\n\nThus far, most of the people known to have been pursued by Fancy Bear through a Google AMP exploit appear to have been journalists who were investigating allegations of corruption or other wrongdoing by people affiliated with the Russian government.\n\nOne such target was Aric Toler, a researcher and writer for the website Bellingcat who specializes in analyzing Russian media and the countrys relationship with far-right groups within Europe and America. He was also part of a Bellingcat investigative team that uncovered evidence that Russian-backed rebels had mistakenly shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board.\n\nA month before critics of Googles AMP implementation began warning about security vulnerabilities, Fancy Bear was utilizing them to target Toler in two separate fake password-reset messages sent to his personal account. These messages, which Toler provided to Salon, utilized an even more sophisticated form of password theft called spear-phishing, which combines standard phishing techniques with specific personal information gleaned about the target via social media and public mailing lists.\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2016, Toler received an email supposedly from Google alerting him that he had recently changed his security settings to enable older email programs to access his account. Please be aware that it is now easier for an attacker to break into your account, the message warned. It invited him to click on a Google AMP URL redirected to a fake webpage designed to capture his email credentials and transmit them to hackers.\n\nThe next day, Toler received a second message claiming to be from Google alerting him that government-backed attackers may be trying to steal your password. The malicious email instructed him to Change password by clicking on another Google AMP webpage. The second message appears to have been crafted in response to a tweet Toler had published on Oct. 11 in which he reported receiving a legitimate email from Google warning him about government-backed attackers.\n\nThese messages were not sent to Toler at random. They were among 14 emails that he received in 2015 and 2016 trying to extract his account information out. Notably, the earlier messages used a less-sophisticated fake link, one created using the URL shortener Bitly that most reasonably web-savvy people would understand not to click. As the hackers grew more desperate to steal Tolers information, they used progressively better methods.\n\nA screenshot of a forged email from Google that Russian-linked hackers sent to journalist Aric Toler in an attempt to steal his account information.\n\nDespite their improved technique at exploiting the AMP vulnerability, the hackers who targeted Toler got sloppy. They reused a free email account registered to annaablony@mailcom that had been had used in several previous operations, including creating a domain used in a different phishing attack that the cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect had archived in its database of known hacker activities.\n\nThreatConnect analyzed the phishing emails Bellingcat received and identified connections to the Russian threat actor known as FANCY BEAR/APT 28/Sofacy, a company representative told Salon. These emails attempted to lure their targets by taking them to a fake Google login page where they would enter their credentials. To do this, the attackers leveraged both Googles AMP services and link shortening services to obscure the fact that the page was not a legitimate Google site and to make it look readable if the target was using a mobile phone.\n\n* . * . *\n\nToler and his Bellingcat colleagues did not fall for Fancy Bears AMP attacks. But another journalist who writes frequently about Russia, David Satter, was taken in by a similar AMP phishing message sent via the annaablony@mailcom address.\n\nShortly after Satter was tricked into visiting the fake website and entering his password, a program that was hosting the site logged into his Gmail account and downloaded its entire contents. Within three weeks, as the Canadian website Citizen Lab reported, the perpetrators of the hack began posting Satters documents online, and even altering them to make opponents and critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin look bad.\n\nCommenting on Satters case in May, John Gruber, the software developer and early AMP skeptic, stressed that even an advanced web user might be fooled by a malicious AMP webpage.\n\nA huge reason that phishing works is that most people just arent technically savvy enough to tell a phony-looking URL from a legitimate one, he wrote. But a URL that really is coming from the google.com domain  thats the sort of link that even a web developer might think looks legit, especially at a glance.\n\nWhile the creator and tech lead of Googles AMP project, Malte Ubl, has been publicly dismissive of external web developers criticizing AMP, the company says it has made a number of changes to its implementation, although it will not explain what they are. This tight-lipped behavior about its own policies and conduct has made Google notorious in the tech world, even as the company demands transparency from other public actors.\n\nIn a statement before this story was published, a Google representative claimed that AMP links are protected by its Safe Browsing technology. The company did not specify when it had implemented this protection, however. After this story was published, a Google representative told Salon that the Safe Browsing screening of AMP addresses was implemented in early January of 2017.\n\nUnder the system, AMP URLs when created via a webpage are first visited by a Google security scanner which attempts to verify if they have malicious content on them.\n\nEvery AMP page that can be linked to through google.com/amp has at least been visited by Googles system, a company representative told Salon.\n\nOn occasions when Google has not pre-screened a webpage, the AMP redirect will display a redirect notice which informs the user that he/she is being taken to a different address. The page also offers the users a chance to return to the last site they had visited If you do not want to visit that page.\n\nWhile more helpful than simply redirecting, the notice is likely to be unhelpful for computer novices simply just trying to reset their passwords since its written in web developer jargon and does not explain that clicking the link could potentially be hazardous.\n\nAs this article was being researched and Salon contacted Google for comment, Ubl blocked public comments on the Github bug report filed about Googles AMP implementation.\n\nAt press time, Google is still serving AMP webpages listed in search results from the Google.com domain. One such article from a fake news website claimed that Google was itself suppressing evidence about the existence of the imaginary planet Nibiru.\n\nMore things  will come on Googles side in the future and we are working with browser vendors to eventually get the origin right, Ubl wrote in a February update.\n\nDespite those assurances, however, some people who work with large web media companies are beginning to get nervous.\n\nWeve been supportive of AMP as much as it benefits competition and leverages the open web, Jason Kint, CEO of a web publishing trade association, told Salon. Kints group, Digital Content Next, counts most U.S.-based television networks, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and many other prominent websites as members.\n\nThis report of an ongoing security issue is troubling and exactly why consolidation of power and closed standards are problematic, Kint said. The sooner AMP migrates to the open web and becomes less tied to the interests of Google, in every way the better.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information about a partial fix to the AMP security issue described in this article."

The bill next goes to the president for his signature. The White House has said Trump is expected to sign the bill on Friday at 5pm EST.\n\nThe Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries , prolonged the vote with a record-setting speech in which he decried provisions in the bill that would slash social safety net programs in order to offset the cost of making Trumps tax cuts permanent.\n\nOnly two House Republicans voted against the measure, for different reasons that showed the ideological span of the partys wafer-thin majority. Kentucky congressman Thomas Massie , a libertarian-leaning fiscal hawk who has drawn Trumps wrath for opposing his agenda, and Pennsylvania congressman Brian Fitzpatrick , who was opposed to the Medicaid cuts.\n\nDemocrats led by Jeffries assailed the bill as an all-out assault on the American people. Meanwhile, Democratic groups were vowing to hammer Republicans for their support of a bill that projections say would lead millions of Americans to lose their health insurance. Share Updated at 16.05 EDT\n\n27m ago 15.46 EDT Maryland congressman Andy Harris, chair of the far-right House Freedom caucus, told reporters on Capitol Hill: If winning is caving, then I guess we caved. Harris repeatedly cited unspecified agreements with the Trump administration for persuading himself and other hardliners to drop their objections to the bill. He declined to divulge any details about the agreement brokered at the White House, telling reporters to ask the president. This is a very good Republican product, he added. Its going to move the presidents agenda forward. Its going to actually seriously deal with spending and, of course, not provide a tax increase to middle-class America. The bill is projected to add trillions to the national debt. Share Updated at 15.55 EDT\n\n35m ago 15.38 EDT Democrats and liberal activists have assailed the bill, warning that they will hold Republicans who voted for it accountable in next years midterm elections. This budget is as cruel as it is corrupt. House Republicans just voted to gut Medicaid, kick millions off Snap, rip free school lunches from kids, and pour billions into Ice  all so their donors can rake in more tax breaks, said Indivisibles co-founder and co-executive director Ezra Levin. Trump just made every single Republican more vulnerable  and while theyll try to spin this disastrous bill, they know exactly how deep the hole theyve dug is. But when Trump snaps his fingers, they fall in line  no matter how many families they throw under the bus. That spineless loyalty will be their downfall. Share Updated at 15.43 EDT\n\n37m ago 15.35 EDT Congressman Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican who was one of the conservative holdouts, told reporters on Capitol Hill that Trump understands the art of a deadline. I believe thats why they called the vote last night, because that put everybody at the table, and they said, This is the deadline, he said, explaining how the president and leaders eventually quelled their short-lived revolt. Major changes to the bill, which they had demanded, would have required Senate approval, which Burchett did not believe they would get again. It would have died, it would have never it would have never passed. If it went back to the Senate, [Alaska senator Lisa] Murkowski  we would never get her vote again.

We knew that if we won, and we believed we would, we knew that if we got unified government, wed have to quite literally fix every area of public policy, Johnson said. Everything was an absolute disaster under the Biden-Harris, radical, woke, progressive Democrat regime, and we took the best effort that we could, in one big, beautiful bill, to fix as much of it as we could. Johnson then signed the legislation that will be sent to the White House. Share Updated at 15.31 EDT\n\n1h ago 15.09 EDT Massie, the other Republican who has consistently opposed the bill, said he voted against it on Thursday because of the harm he believes it would do to the nations finances.

As Ive stated throughout these negotiations, with each iteration of legislative text that was placed on the House floor, Ive maintained a close and watchful eye on the specific details of these provisions, and determined the specific district impact, positive or negative, on our PA-1 community. I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief, and for historic investments in our border security and our military. However, it was the Senates amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community. The original House language was written in a way that protected our community; the Senate amendments fell short of our standard. I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions. Fitzpatrick represents a competitive, heavily suburban Pennsylvania district.

Representative Tom Emmer, another member of leadership, repeated the Republican claim that the bill cuts only waste, fraud and abuse from Medicaid. According to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill cuts roughly $1t from Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. It would result in an estimated 11.8 million people losing health insurance over the next decade. To put it simply, Emmer said, this bill is President Trumps Make America Great Again agenda.

Many expected Johnson  soft-spoken, deeply religious and lacking leadership experience  would meet a similar fate. Yet, in the months since, Johnson has surprised both his critics and colleagues by holding together one of the narrowest House majorities in modern history. He has overcome the threat of rebellion from the hard-right faction of his party and mollified moderates uneasy with aspects of the presidents agenda. One critical factor in his success so far: Trumps support. The presidents backing has largely helped insulate Johnson from the kind of rightwing backlash.

        "content": "Who would have thought that two Brazilian clubs would reach the Club World Cup quarter-finals? If Fluminense beat Al-Hilal in Orlando on Friday and Palmeiras get the better of Chelsea a few hours later in Philadelphia, one of them will make it to the final. Chelsea have already been embarrassed by one Brazilian side at the tournament  they were trounced 3-1 by Flamengo a fortnight ago in the group stage  but they are still favourites to beat Palmeiras in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe English side came out on top when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup three years ago, winning 2-1 thanks to a 117th-minute penalty converted by Kai Havertz. At that point, a young prodigy known as Messinho, or little Messi, was taking his first steps in the Palmeiras academy having joined from Cruzeiro. When the teams meet again on Friday night, Estvo Willian will be the central focus. The 18-year-old is inextricably linked to both clubs, having turned professional at one before agreeing to join the other in a deal that could be worth up to 52m.\n\nHaving signed a deal to join Chelsea a year ago, Estvo travelled to the Club World Cup knowing that Palmeiras last game in the United States would also be his last before he crosses the Atlantic. The teenager has admitted that he has struggled to focus on the task at hand. Its very difficult, he said. Its a dream that Im going to fulfil, but knowing that I have to focus here, that I have to work, its not easy. The closer it gets, the anxiety hits. Im trying to focus as much as possible, and leave well, through the front door, knowing that I gave my best for Palmeiras.\n\nIn an era when players are media trained into mumbling tedious and unrevealing soundbites, this was a welcome and rare example of a high-profile player being vulnerable and speaking his mind. Unsurprisingly, however, in another sign of the times, he was criticised for admitting that his mind might be elsewhere, which forced the Palmeiras manager to leap to his defence.\n\nIts normal, said Abel Ferreira. What distinguishes us from the animals? Feelings and emotions. Its normal to be nervous, normal for a boy to have a dream. Hes so pure and such a young lad. To be 18 and say what he feels is normal but a large part [of the media and fans] slaughtered him. Thats what you do to players. Thats what sells, the blood. You make money one way and we make money another.\n\nView image in fullscreen Estvo takes a corner for Palmeiras in their 1-0 win against Botafogo in the last 16. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images\n\nThere is a perception in Brazil that Estvo has not delivered for Palmeiras in his very limited time in the first team and could leave the club still not having bossed a big game  especially when compared to Endrick, the last phenom to emerge at the So Paulo club. Popular Brazilian pundit Paulo Vinicius Coelho, widely known as PVC, points out that, whereas Endrick lifted two Brazilian league titles and scored the goal that won the title in 2023 before joining Real Madrid, Estvo is still waiting for a game that defines his time at Palmeiras.\n\nIf Estvo goes to Chelsea without deciding the game, we are used to hearing that he doesnt score against the rivals in the biggest matches, says PVC. He scores against Cuiab, against Juventude, against small clubs, but he doesnt score against Santos, Corinthians, So Paulo, Flamengo, Botafogo, Porto, Al-Ahly, Inter Miami, or Chelsea. Playing against Chelsea is very important. Where is his mind? He needs to work on his mentality. If he fails on Saturday, many Palmeiras fans will say he didnt have his head in the game.\n\nPVC is quick to add that Estvo is the most intelligent player at Palmeiras and that when it comes to his skills, nobody argues about that. Henrique Rojas, a lifelong matchgoing Palmeiras fan, agrees and adds that he is by far the most skilled player that has come through the academy in decades.\n\nHe has speed, dribbling and spatial intelligence that is above average  but hes still only 18 and still needs to improve a lot, says Rojas. He needs to get stronger physically and improve his finishing. These are the reasons he hasnt really shone in the big games yet  in addition to the fact that he became the countrys biggest name in one year and has been heavily marked ever since. But hes a good kid, hes never slacked off and has a bright future. As this is his last tournament before leaving, he is anxious. Both Abel and the squad are shielding him from criticism and he will have another chance to show his best.\n\nEven if Estvo can work some magic, there is no doubt that Chelsea are the favourites. Palmeiras are not in the best form, says PVC. They were better two months ago than they are today. Beating a big rival in a big game is the key to kicking on, and they need to prove themselves. Rojas agrees. Although Chelsea are inconsistent under Maresca, they are the favourites, he says. Just look at the players values and the fact they are in the most powerful league in the world. Its 60/40 for Chelsea, but thats the beauty of cup games  one detail changes everything.\n\nIf Palmeiras pull off their heist of the century so far, Ferreira will face even more jokes about how his team defies the odds so often. The manager  whose rousing team talks and press conferences are something to behold  has been teased by rival fans about the dark arts he must practise to pull off so many shocks.\n\nRivals joke that he sacrifices animals and has a pact with the devil because Palmeiras have managed to mount comebacks in many games that seemed lost, says Rojas. But the truth is that to limit him to just a motivational coach is nonsense. Abel has changed the team in so many ways and different moments that it is impossible not to respect him. He is one of the greatest coaches in the clubs history, if not the greatest, and he achieved all this in just five years. He decides everything related to football at the club and he is a rare unanimous choice for a fanbase that is always dissatisfied. He is a kind of Simeone at Atltico Madrid.\n\nSome fans criticise his inventions  such as playing with double full-backs or persisting with players in bad form  but every coach has that. Palmeiras have offered him another contract until the end of 2027 and, deep down, no Palmeiras fan wants him to leave. The passion between Abel and Palmeiras is one of the most beautiful things that has ever happened and we will always be by his side.\n\nView image in fullscreen Estvo preparing to face Inter Miami in the group stage. Photograph: Hctor Vivas/FIFA/Getty Images\n\nPalmeiras fans know they cannot stop Estvo from leaving but they worry that Chelsea is not the ideal destination for the youngster. Chelsea are a team with many ups and downs, says Rojas. They are signing a lot of young players but they fire coaches and lack experienced players who can help players like Estvo in their day-to-day life. All this without mentioning the difference of living in another country and facing a harsh winter. He is a person, not a machine. Perhaps the Spanish league or a team like Arsenal would be more natural for him.\n\nPVC also has doubts about Chelsea. Chelsea bought three young Brazilian players before: Deivid Washington who went back to Santos; ngelo, who went to Strasbourg; and Andr Santos, who returned from Strasbourg to Chelsea but he has only played a few minutes in the Club World Cup. Estvo is too young for a club that is in a new phase. I dont think its the best decision, but young Brazilian players always want to go to Europe as quickly as possible.\n\nThis is an article by Tom Sanderson"

        "content": "A protest Tuesday co-led by the California Nurses Assn. called on Rep. Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills) to vote against President Trumps spending bill outside Kims field office in Anaheim.\n\nProtesters railed on Tuesday against an Orange County congresswoman who could be a crucial vote on President Trumps proposal to cut more than $1 trillion in federal dollars that helped pay for healthcare for those in need and extend tax cuts for millions of Americans.\n\nTrumps proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act narrowly passed the U.S. Senate hours before hundreds of people gathered in a cul-de-sac outside of the Anaheim field office of Republican Rep. Young Kim to protest those cuts. The legislation still needs to be voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives, which could happen before the end of the week.\n\nI dont know why they call it beautiful, because theres nothing about it thats beautiful. Its harmful, its reckless, and its cruel, and its going to hurt people, said Melody Mendenhall, a nurse at UCLA who is active with the California Nurses Assn., which was among the groups that organized the protest. Rep. Young Kim, hear our cry, hear our voices. We need our Medicaid. We cannot afford this type of reckless cuts and behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA security guard blocked the parking lot to Kims office and at least a half-dozen Anaheim police officers watched the protest unfold.\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this story said observers of the protest who dashed inside the building when protesters approached it appeared to be members of Rep. Young Kims staff. A member of Kims congressional staff said the observers were part of the buildings management team and did not work for the congresswoman.\n\nSeveral people who, according to an official in Kims congressional office, were members of the buildings management team watched the demonstration from outside the building before they dashed inside when protesters marched to the building, unsuccessfully sought to enter it and then began chanting Shame! Shame!\n\nIn a statement, Kim said that her door was always open to Californians in her district.\n\nI understand some of my constituents are concerned and know how important Medicaid services are for many in my community, which is why I voted to protect and strengthen Medicaid services for our most vulnerable citizens who truly need it, Kim said. I have met with many of these local healthcare advocates in recent months.\n\nTrumps proposal would dramatically overhaul the nations tax code by making cuts approved during the presidents first term permanent, a major benefit to the corporations and the nations wealthy, while slashing funding for historic federal safety-net programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps provide food to low-income Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoughly 15 million Californians, more than a third in the state, are on Medi-Cal, the states version of Medicaid, with some of the highest percentages in rural counties that supported Trump in the November election. More than half of California children receive healthcare coverage through Medi-Cal.\n\nA version of the Republican bill was passed by the House with Kims support. The U.S. Senate narrowly approved an amended version of the bill Tuesday. The defection of three GOP senators meant Vice President JD Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote for it to pass in that chamber.\n\nThe House and Senate will now work to reconcile their two different versions of the bill. This week was a district workweek for members of Congress, but House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) ordered members back to Washington, D.C., for votes on the bill that could occur Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans hope to get the legislation to President Trumps desk for his signature by the Fourth of July, though there is some concern among its members about whether they will have enough votes to pass the bill because of potential defections and the united Democratic opposition.\n\nAn analysis released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Sunday estimated that the Senate version of the proposal would increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034 and would result in 11.8 million Americans losing health insurance in less than a decade.\n\nTrump praised the passage of the bill on social media and urged House Republicans to support the Senate plan.\n\nThe proposal has caused a rift within the GOP, and some House members have expressed reservations about the measure because of the amount it would add to the nations deficit and its effect on their constituents.\n\nIve been clear from the start that I will not support a final reconciliation bill that makes harmful cuts to Medicaid, puts critical funding at risk, or threatens the stability of healthcare providers, in his congressional district, Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) wrote on the social media site X on Sunday.\n\nHe represents more than half a million Central Valley residents who rely on Medicaid  the most of any congressional district in California, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center. A spokesperson for Valadao on Tuesday didnt respond to a question about how the congressman planned to vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKims Orange County district is more affluent than Valadaos, but roughly one in five of her constituents relies on Medicaid.\n\nThe congresswoman was en route to Washington at the time of the protest, according to a spokesperson.\n\nOutside her Anaheim field office, protester after protester described how the bill would impact vulnerable Californians, such as disabled children, the elderly, veterans and those who would lose access to reproductive healthcare.\n\nThe stakes have never been higher. We are living in a time when our rights are under attack, said Emily Escobar, a public advocacy manager for Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties.\n\nShe said that federal funds do not pay for abortions, but help pay for other vital healthcare, such as cancer screenings, preventative care, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and access to contraception. More than one-third of Planned Parenthoods patients nationwide reside in California.\n\nThese cuts will result in clinics being shut down, effectively reducing access to abortion, Escobar said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me make this clear, this bill is a backdoor abortion ban, she said.\n\nShari Home, 73, said she and her husband were weighing how to divide their Social Security income on food, medication and medical supplies after her husband, who suffers several chronic health conditions, fell last year.\n\nThe hospitalizations were so expensive, so we applied for and got Medi-Cal in January and food assistance, and its been such a lifesaver, said the Laguna Woods resident. Without Medi-Cal, I dont know what we would do. Our lives would not be good. We would not have the medications that he needs.\n\nMichelle Del Rosario, 57, wore a button picturing her son William, 25, on her blouse. The Orange resident, one of Kims constituents who has previously voted for her, is the primary caregiver for her son, who has autism, epilepsy and does not speak.\n\nHer son relies on his Medi-Cal coverage for his $5,000-a-month seizure medicine, as well as the home health support he receives, she said.\n\nHe lives at home. He has desires, at some point, to live independently, to work, but he needs these support services for that to happen, Del Rosario said."

        "content": "With more than 100 people dead, many of them children attending a Christian summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River, Fridays extreme flash flooding that overwhelmed a sizeable chunk of central Texas will be recorded as one of the states worst ever natural disasters.\n\nThe brunt of the tragedy was felt in Kerr county, where at least 27 children and counselors were killed after a deluge of water described by one witness as a a pitch-black wall of death swept through the all-girl Camp Mystic on the rivers south fork. About 750 young campers were celebrating the Fourth of July holiday.\n\nElsewhere in the county, authorities reported almost 50 more deaths, a number certain to rise in the coming days as the grim task of recovering bodies continues.\n\nAlongside the human toll, torrential rain and catastrophic flooding caused near-unprecedented levels of destruction, affecting homes, businesses and vehicles. A preliminary estimate by the private weather service AccuWeather places the damage and economic loss at $18bn-$22bn (13.2bn-16.2bn).\n\nEveryone in the community is hurting, said Dalton Rice, the city manager of Kerrville, the county seat, at a press conference on Sunday. We are seeing bodies recovered all over, up and down.\n\nView image in fullscreen Search and rescue volunteers comb the land near Camp Mystic. Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThe first inkling that a disaster was imminent came in a bulletin issued by the Austin-San Antonio office of the National Weather Service at 1.18pm local time on Thursday, warning that pockets of heavy rain are expected and may result in flooding of low-lying areas, rivers/creeks, and low water crossings.\n\nThe message was amplified in a post to X little more than an hour later.\n\nShortly after midnight on Friday, the NWS was warning of significant impacts from torrential rain dousing counties north of San Antonio, which never let up through the early morning hours and swelled rivers and other waterways at an astonishing pace.\n\nBy 5.16am, the City of Kerrvilles police department was warning of a life-threatening event and urging anyone living along the Guadalupe River to immediately move to higher ground  warnings that some residents said came too late, or were not received at all.\n\nspeeded-up footage of river rising and sweeping through area 4 July, Kingsland, Texas. Timelapse of river rising.\n\nAccording to meteorologists, some parts of central Texas had several months worth of rain in just a few hours, while gauges in the unincorporated Kerr county community of Hunt, where Camp Mystic is located, recorded 6.5in (16.5cm) of rain in only 180 minutes.\n\nSome areas received up to 15in (38.1cm) through the day on Friday, more than a summers worth of rain in a single day, and reports of rainfall up to 8in (20.3cm) were widespread.\n\nThe Guadalupe River rose by 26ft (8 metres) in 45 minutes, and 33ft (10 metres) in only two hours, surpassing the level of 31.5ft (9.6 metres) from a July 1987 flood less than 20 miles (32km) east of Kerrville in which 10 teenagers from a Christian summer camp drowned after their bus stalled in flood water.\n\nSearch and rescue crews from local, state and federal agencies, using drones, boats and helicopters, were deployed at first light on Friday, as news footage began to convey the scale of the disaster.\n\nAt a briefing on Saturday, authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, with more than 400 first responders from almost two dozen agencies covering an area of over 60 miles (97 miles). The number of responders passed 1,000 by the end of the day.\n\nThe Texas national guard deployed a MQ-9 Reaper uncrewed aerial vehicle over remote spots, while personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) joined emergency teams from other states in the search for survivors.\n\nRice, the Kerrville city manager, criticised the operation of unauthorised drones by private citizens and the news media for interfering with the rescue effort, which he said was further hampered by difficult terrain and more heavy rain.\n\nBy Sunday morning, 48 hours after the water first started to rise, and after a full day of recovering and identifying bodies while searching for those still missing, it was clear that central Texas had experienced its worst flooding event  and one of its most costly natural disasters  in decades.\n\nThe states governor, Greg Abbott, appeared at a press conference the day before to insist that crews would continue to consider anyone unaccounted for as alive, and called a statewide day of prayer for Sunday.\n\nAll we know is that prayer does work, he said, signing a request for a federal emergency declaration that the president, Donald Trump, approved on Sunday, freeing up more money and resources for recovery efforts.\n\nCamp Mystic\n\nThe popular private Christian summer camp, which is due to celebrate its centenary in 2026, lost at least 27 campers and counselors, it said in a post to its website. Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy. We are praying for them constantly, it said.\n\nThe camps longtime owner and director, Richard Dick Eastland, was among those lost.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dormitories on lower ground at Camp Mystic were completely overwhelmed.

Photographs from inside one of the buildings show metal beds thrown around, as well as pink and purple sleeping bags and bedding, lunchboxes and mud-covered luggage that was abandoned as campers and staff evacuated.\n\nAbout 750 girls were attending the camp, which offers more than 30 activities during three month-long terms over the summer to provide young girls with a wholesome Christian atmosphere in which they can develop outstanding personal qualities and self-esteem.\n\nBy Monday night, 10 campers and one counselor were still unaccounted for. Families with ties to Camp Mystic gathered in Dallas for a vigil at the George W Bush Presidential Center.\n\nView image in fullscreen Search and rescue workers dig through debris in Hunt, Texas.

Others found they had no homes to go back to, some taking refuge in a Red Cross centre in Kerrville.\n\nKathy Perkins told the Guardian that her trailer home was damaged by water, but some of her neighbours homes were swept away or moved around in the flood.\n\nThe White House announced that Trump would visit, probably on Friday, to look at the damage and announce more federal aid in terms of money and resources for Kerr county and neighbouring areas.\n\nAnother Hunt resident, Lesa Baird, 65, rode out the flood in a tree, then walked to her local Baptist church for help. Theres no home to go to. Its done, she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen By Monday night, 10 campers and one counselor at Camp Mystic were still unaccounted for.

(CNN)\n\nDominion Voting Systems had two goals in its defamation case against Fox News  accountability and trying to make Dominion whole, said Justin Nelson, the lead counsel election technology company.\n\nBoth were accomplished in this settlement, he told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the networks statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was a strong message of accountability and an important victory for the employees of his clients company.\n\nThis is really the first time that anyone has paid a price for telling the lies of the 2020 election and were very proud about that, he said.\n\nWhile the settlement does not stipulate that Foxs anchors must acknowledge the lies on air, Nelson said it was a consequential outcome for the network.\n\nThe texts and emails that emerged during the litigation process from inside the Fox network were valuable, he said. And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if youre telling lies.\n\nPrevious court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air.\n\nIts a lot of what we teach our kids, which is that the truth does indeed matter, and if you are lying, eventually theres going to be consequences to that, Nelson said.\n\nHe said the settlement with Fox sends a strong message to other right-wing outlets in which Dominion has ongoing legal disputes."

        "content": "Vice President JD Vance on Friday castigated Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, arguing that the elected leaders are endangering the lives of law enforcement officers because of their opposition to federal immigration raids in Los Angeles and surrounding communities.\n\nVance, while meeting with federal, state and local officials in Los Angeles on Friday afternoon, justified President Trumps decision to seize control of California National Guard troops from Newsom and deploy them in Los Angeles, a decision that triggered a legal battle between state and federal officials.\n\nVIDEO | 01:39 Vice President JD Vance rips Newsom, Bass and mocks Padilla during visit to Los Angeles Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened here was a tragedy, Vance told reporters. You had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law, and you had rioters, egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job.\n\nAlthough Newsom and Bass have criticized the immigration raids, which led to protests and sporadic violent attacks against law enforcement officials, both have repeatedly urged demonstrators to remain peaceful.\n\nBass, who was not invited to meet with Vance, dismissed his description of what has unfolded in Los Angeles over the last two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, the vice president did not take time to learn about our city and understand that our city is a city of immigrants from every country and continent on the planet, Bass said at a news conference Friday evening. But then again, he did need to justify the hundreds of millions of wasted taxpayer dollars that were wasted in the performance of a stunt.\n\nHow dare you say that city officials encourage violence, Bass said. We kept the peace.\n\nNewsom weighed in repeatedly on the social media platform X, notably about Vance calling Sen. Alex Padilla Jose during his remarks.\n\nPadilla was dragged to the ground by federal law enforcement officers and briefly detained when he attempted to ask U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question during a news conference last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question, but unfortunately I guess he decided not to show up because there wasnt a theater, and thats all it is, Vance said.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC the following morning, Padilla suggested the misnaming was intentional  and a reflection of skewed priorities.\n\nHe knows my name, Padilla said. Look, sadly, its just an indicator of how petty and unserious this administration is. But hes the vice president of the United States. You think hed take the the situation in Los Angeles more seriously.\n\nVances visit to Los Angeles, which lasted less than five hours, coincided with the Republican National Committees annual summer retreat taking place in Beverly Hills. Tickets to a fundraiser at the Four Seasons that Vance appeared at cost up to $445,000, according to NOTUS, a nonprofit news group.\n\nVance landed at LAX around 1:35 p.m. and toured the Federal Building Command Center, an FBI Mobile Command Center that is being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He was briefed by officials from the Department of Defense, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department and the California Highway Patrol.\n\nReporters traveling with the vice president were told they were not allowed to cover Vances meetings with officials there because the facility contained classified information. Vance was also scheduled to meet with Marines during his visit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his visit with federal officials, Vance called Newsoms and Bass actions during the protests disgraceful, referred to the actions as riots and said that was why Trump decided to deploy troops from the California National Guard.\n\nWe have to remember that the day that the riots started, before there was ever a single national Guardsman, before the president of the United States had sent in additional resources, you had law enforcement officers that were being captured and beaten by a violent mob, egged on by Gavin Newsom and other officials, Vance told reporters at the command center. It was necessary to send in the National Guard to stop that process to bring some order back to this great city.\n\nThe vice president attended the fundraiser in Beverly Hills, and was aloft in Air Force Two shortly after 6 p.m.\n\nNewsom has repeatedly criticized the federal raids, saying they violated Trumps vow to target violent, criminal immigrants, but also urged Californians protesting the actions to do so peacefully and said those who engaged in lawlessness would be arrested.\n\nDuring protests in downtown Los Angeles, federal agents stood guard around federal buildings that were the focus of protesters. Los Angeles police officers, as well as officers from other local police agencies and the California Highway Patrol, responded in large numbers and repeatedly moved demonstrators away from National Guard troops pushing the crowds to undulate across downtowns Civic Center.\n\nStanding next to Bill A. Essayli, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, and FBI Assistant Director Akil Davis, Vance defended the deployment of Marines and National Guard troops in Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThats why were here, thats why these guys are standing beside me, Vance said. Thats why we have close to 5,000 soldiers and Marines from the Department of Defense. Its because weve got to enforce the law.\n\nThe visit comes as California and federal officials battle in court over control of the California National Guard. Trump federalized the troops over the objections of Newsom and sent them to L.A. after immigration raids sparked protests.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals kept control of the troops in Trumps hands while the issue is litigated in federal court. On Friday, a federal judge in San Francisco asked attorneys for the federal and state governments to submit briefs by noon on Monday about the Posse Comitatus Act, which largely prohibits the use of federal military forces in civilian law enforcement, and the length of time the California National Guard is under control of the federal government.\n\nAtty. Gen. Rob Bonta has vowed to continue fighting the Trump administration over the decision.\n\nThe clash has left Newsom and officials in the Trump administration trading barbs in interviews and social media. Vance did not meet with the highest elected officials of the countrys most populous state.\n\nWere always open to working together  which makes it all the more disappointing that the White House chose not to engage with us directly ahead of the visit, a statement from the governors office read. Weve yet to receive any official notice of the Vice Presidents trip  which, from what we understand, is focused on a high-dollar fundraiser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewsom later released a video on X, addressing Vance directly and urging the vice president to meet with victims of the Palisades and Altadena fires.\n\nIts been months now since some of the most devastating wildfires in U.S. history occurred  tens of thousands of lives completely torn asunder, Newsom said in the video. I hope you have an opportunity to spend some quality time with some of the victims of the families in the Palisades and also spend some time in Altadena, which is incredibly important.\n\nNewsom also urged Vance to speak with Trump about comments the president made earlier this week, suggesting he would cut disaster relief for the fires because of the ongoing feud with Newsom.\n\nIts honestly important as well, and I honestly mean this, that you sit down with the president of the United States, who just a couple of days ago suggested that these American citizens may not get the support that other citizens get all across this country in terms of disaster relief, Newsom said. I hope we get that back on track. Were counting on you, Mr. Vice President.\n\nTimes staff writer Julia Wick, Dave Zahniser and Lila Seidman contributed to this report."

        "content": "Editors Note: The following contains major spoilers about the fourth episode of Successions fourth season, Honeymoon States.\n\nCNN \n\nAfter the shock came the aftershocks, the power vacuum, and perhaps most significantly and impressively, the laughs, as Succession pivoted to face life after Logan Roy, in an episode that finally put the HBO shows title into full flower.\n\nLogan Roys abrupt demise left his grown children and subordinates scrambling, with each seemingly humbly offering themselves up to fill the void, while fretting about how the various candidates would play with the companys board.\n\nAt the same time, they mourned the larger-than-life figure they had lost, taking into account that he had treated many of them abysmally. And the fourth hour also marked the return of Logans wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass), in what felt like Marcia Strikes Back, while his current and much younger girlfriend, Kerri (Zoe Winter), was bluntly shown the door. (The latter evoked memories of the musical Evita, when the title character boots Perons mistress, who sings about another suitcase in another hall.)\n\nMore than anything, the episode underscored just how brutally funny Succession can be, with Shiv (Sarah Snook) reading her fathers obituary and musing, Dad sounds amazing. I would like to have met dad, while brothers Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) hilariously translated the language, with references to Logan having been a man of his time equaling racist.\n\nThe episode also showcased the executives at Waystar Royco, who uncomfortably wondered what to do with a document that included not only Logans posthumous wishes but hand-written notes that seemingly specified who he wished to succeed him. They joked, feebly, about tossing the paper in the toilet, while making very clear how much they really wanted to toss the paper in the toilet.\n\nAll the knives came out, with Carl (David Rasche) brutally insulting Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), scarcely hiding behind the fact that he was presenting the doubts about Toms future as a hypothetical.\n\nAmid that, though, there were also human moments, with the tortured Kendall articulating his conflicted feelings to Waystar executive Frank (Peter Friedman) by saying, He made me hate him, and he died. I feel like he didnt like me. I disappointed him.\n\nSuccession also underscored the fragility of not just life, but a corporate legacy, with the public-relations folk discussing how to spin and diminish Logans involvement in his later years as a means of bucking up the company and its stock price  a maneuver that Kendall ultimately and surreptitiously approved, concluding that it was the sort of smart and ruthless move that his father would have executed.\n\nBrian Cox as Logan Roy in \"Succession.\" HBO\n\nQuestions of succession also appear to be threatening the harmony achieved by Kendall, Shiv and Roman prior to Logans exit, with Shiv being left as the odd woman out in a plan to fill the CEO seat just long enough to close the sale to GoJo. Trust doesnt come easily in series creator Jesse Armstrongs world, and when Shiv said, I need to wet my beak, the assurances from her brothers clearly left the impression how easily that beak could wind up bent out of joint.\n\nUltimately, after the operating highs of the previous episode, the series successfully turned the page from grieving to the next order of business. And that too, as Kendall put it regarding Logan and the bad dad PR leaks, is what he would do."

        "content": "A demonstrator holds a sign that reads in Spanish, To gentrify is to erase memories, during a protest on Friday against gentrification in Mexico City.\n\nSince the early days of the pandemic, foreigners have flooded Mexico City, particularly Americans and Europeans drawn by the cost of living and possibilities of remote work.\n\nDuring that time, several neighborhoods in the city center have transformed, with tortilleras, corner stores and barber shops replaced by wine bars, cafes and Pilates studios, many of which advertise in English. Rents have soared, and some locals have been priced out of their homes.\n\nSome blame the citys housing crunch and rising costs on the new arrivals  and the more than 35,000 Airbnbs operating here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent days, that anger spilled into the streets.\n\nA demonstrator burns an effigy of U.S. President Trump in Parque Mexico in Mexico City on Friday, during a protest against gentrification, as the increase in remote workers has raised prices and increased housing demand in neighborhoods like Condesa and Roma. (Jon Orbach / Associated Press)\n\nA march against gentrification drew hundreds of people, with protesters holding signs that said gringo go home, and demanding that Mexican leaders curb short-term rentals and tax foreigners.\n\nIt was held on July 4  U.S. Independence Day  and was advertised as a protest against American imperialism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe march, which passed the U.S. Embassy, was mostly peaceful. But later, some marchers turned to vandalism, smashing windows of more than a dozen storefronts, including a bank, a popular taco chain and a Starbucks.\n\nVideos showed protesters harassing tourists seated at an upscale taquera until they got up and left. Some patrons sitting at street-side cafes targeted by the demonstrators protested that they were Mexicans, not foreigners, in some cases flashing their identification cards.\n\nIn parts of the city, walls remain scrawled with graffiti: My culture is not your trend and Kill a gringo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protests, which echoed demonstrations against mass tourism and high housing costs in other places, including Barcelona, and Berlin, have challenged the long-held notion of Mexico City as a place that welcomes outsiders.\n\nAnd they add fuel to rising bi-national tensions, as President Trump threatens tariffs on Mexican imports and seeks to deport immigrants living without authorization in the United States. Trumps attacks on Mexico have sparked a wave of nationalism, with some people pushing a boycott of American products and companies embracing the red, green and white of the Mexican flag in ad campaigns.\n\nOn social media, where commentators both applauded and assailed the protests, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security joined in the fray, publishing a post on X on Sunday encouraging unauthorized immigrants to self-deport via a Customs and Border Protection application: If you are in the United States illegally and wish to join the next protest in Mexico City, use the CBP Home app to facilitate your departure.\n\nMexican leaders condemned the vandalism and the nativist tone adopted by many protesters.\n\nA demonstrator tosses a restaurant chair at the end of a peaceful protest that turned violent against gentrification in Mexico City on Friday. (Aurea Del Rosario / Associated Press)\n\nXenophobic displays of this kind must be condemned, President Claudia Sheinbaum said at her daily news conference on Monday. Mexico is a country open to the world.\n\nBut she stressed that protesters had legitimate complaints, and that gentrification is a phenomenon that needs to be addressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMexico City Mayor Clara Brugada, who, like Sheinbaum, belongs to the leftist political party that controls much of the country, said the city must focus on building more affordable housing.\n\nWe must continue implementing measures and public policies to combat these phenomena, she said Monday. The demand for housing and rents are increasing overnight, and residents are being evicted because they no longer have the economic means to live there.\n\nSheinbaum, who was mayor of Mexico City before being elected president, was criticized during her term for not taking stronger action against the dispossession of longtime residents as landlords rented out properties to digital nomads, tourists and other foreigners. Demonstrators say the government is still not doing enough.\n\nWere not against migration, which is a human right, one of the collectives that organized the march wrote in a statement. But we have to recognize that the state, institutions and both local and foreign businesses offer different treatment to those with greater purchasing power.\n\nAnalysts have pushed back on the claims that an influx of foreigners is largely to blame for rising costs in Mexico City.\n\nThe reality is that, with or without gringos, housing in Mexico has become enormously more expensive, Viri Ros, a political scientist, wrote in El Pas newspaper. From 2005-21, home prices throughout Mexico increased by 247%, she said. That includes states with low tourist flows, such as Morelos, where prices increased 193%. She said increases in Mexico City have actually decelerated since the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rise in Mexico City precedes the gringos, is happening throughout the country and has causes that go beyond the arrival of tourists or digital nomads, she wrote. More to blame, she said: High construction costs and public policies that mean building is not keeping up with demand. She said Mexico City officials had embraced Airbnb in large part because it is much easier to collect taxes from the company compared with long-term rentals, many of which are paid for with cash.\n\nSome of the neighborhoods currently at the center of debate were first gentrified by Mexicans.\n\nMexico has long been the top foreign travel destination for Americans, its beaches and pueblos luring tens of millions of U.S. visitors annually. But Americans began flooding Mexico City in earnest around 2016, when the New York Times named it the worlds top travel destination, and magazine writers wondered whether it was the new Berlin.\n\nInternational artists, chefs and designers arrived, scooping up inexpensive studio spaces, opening restaurants and integrating themselves into the citys imaginative nightlife.\n\nThe pandemic pushed it into overdrive. As much of Europe and Asia shut their doors to Americans in 2020, Mexico, which adopted few COVID-19 restrictions, was one of the few places where gringos were welcome.\n\nMaking it easier: Americans have long been able to stay here up to six months without a visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor remote workers earning in dollars, the appeal is clear: For the cost of a $2,500 one-bedroom in Los Angeles or New York, a person can rent a penthouse here.\n\nThe phenomenon is transforming some of the citys most beloved neighborhoods into expat enclaves.\n\nEnglish rings out everywhere in the leafy, walkable neighborhoods of Roma, Condesa, Centro and Jurez.\n\nFor years, most people in this metropolis were unwaveringly kind and patient with international visitors.\n\nBut some chilangos, as locals are known, have become fed up.\n\nA protest sign is displayed on a makeshift clothesline during a demonstration against gentrification in Mexico City on Friday. (Fernando Llano/AP)\n\nA few years ago, expletive-laced posters appeared around town. New to the city? Working remotely? they read in English. Youre a fing plague and the locals fing hate you. Leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat sentiment echoed the hundreds of responses that poured in after a young American posted a seemingly innocuous tweet: Do yourself a favor and remote work in Mexico City  it is truly magical.\n\nPlease dont, read one of the nicer replies. This city is becoming more and more expensive every day in part because of people like you, and you dont even realize or care about it.\n\nGenoveva Ramrez, 35, who works in marketing and advertising, commutes two hours each day to the Jurez neighborhood because rent in the city is impossible for me. So, too, is picking up the tab at restaurants, where the price of a sandwich might be quadruple what it used to be. When you see those places, she said, theyre full of foreigners."

        "content": "Elon Musk and President Trump appear together in the Oval Office in May.\n\nIn a final push to prevent passage of President Trumps signature legislation into law, Elon Musk, once his largest benefactor and later his top White House aide, threw the kitchen sink at his former boss.\n\nThe worlds richest man threatened to fund primary challenges against supporters of the bill if it is the last thing I do on this Earth. He threatened to fund the creation of a third party based on fiscal responsibility. And he accused the president of using the bill as a vehicle to defund the ability of courts to enforce contempt orders, making it all but impossible to hold him and his allies accountable for violating the law.\n\nThere is still a slim chance that Musk succeeds. But a Senate vote approving the bill on Tuesday brought Trumps Big Beautiful Bill to the doorstep of passage. The only thing standing in its way now is a handful of Republican lawmakers in the House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump reacted to Musks campaign on Tuesday with a pointed threat. The Department of Government Efficiency, a federal program Musk ran at the start of the administration that aimed to reduce federal spending, could be directed to gut Musks properties of federal contracts, the president warned.\n\nWe might have to put DOGE on Elon, Trump said. Musk owns SpaceX, an aerospace company with deep ties to NASA, as well as Tesla and the X social media platform. You know what DOGE is? The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon  wouldnt that be terrible? He gets a lot of subsidies.\n\nIf DOGE looks at Musk, were going to save a fortune, Trump later added. I dont think he should be playing that game with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Big Beautiful Bill included several provisions that could have rankled Musk, including a phaseout of green energy tax credits passed during the Biden administration that have benefited companies like Tesla.\n\nBut Musk said his priority in the bill was not its impact on the electric vehicle market. Instead, his concern is its overall price tag  a ballooning of the federal debt over the next decades that he said fundamentally undermines his work in the administration.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Senate version of the bill will add $4 trillion to the debt by 2034, and even more if Congress votes later on to remove a series of expiration dates built into the legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk left the Trump administration at the end of his tenure as a special government employee in late May, honored in the Oval Office by Trump with a press conference and a custom embroidered key. But the men fell out dramatically days later, trading insults in an acrimonious public feud that included Musk taking credit for Trumps election victory.\n\nEven within the last few days, Trump has offered mixed messages on the state of his relationship with Musk, wishing him only the best in an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, he was telling reporters that he would take a look at deporting Musk, a U.S. citizen.\n\nWithout subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, and head back to South Africa."

        "content": "Sean Diddy Combs, shown in 2018, was found not guilty of the most serious charges against him: sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and racketeering.\n\nFederal prosecutors announced charges against Sean Diddy Combs with great fanfare last year.\n\nThis was not just a case of a celebrity behaving badly, they said. It was about a criminal enterprise that had, for years, concealed the crimes of a music and fashion mogul.\n\nIt was a bold gambit, and it employed a strategy typically reserved for organized crime cases to prosecute a music legend for alleged violence, threats, and payoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the end, jurors hearing the case in Manhattan did not buy it.\n\nAfter two days of deliberations, the jury found Combs guilty of only two counts of transportation for prostitution involving ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and a second woman identified as Jane in testimony, as well as commercial sex workers.\n\nJurors found Combs not guilty of the most serious crimes: sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and racketeering, which carried a potential life sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a win for Combs. He was facing life in prison if convicted of the [racketeering] charges. Instead, he likely serves a couple years in prison and returns to his business empire, said David Ring, an attorney who represents sexual abuse victims in some of the highest-profile cases. Sean Combs mostly won in court, but in the court of public opinion, he lost big time with his despicable misconduct that was unveiled at trial.\n\nA complex case\n\nThe trial was marked by shocking descriptions of Combs abuse of women. But some legal experts questioned whether the graphic testimony proved racketeering.\n\nJeff Chemerinsky, a former federal prosecutor, said, Whatever people may think of the conduct as a moral matter, this jury decided that the government did not meet its burden to prove all the elements of the serious felony charges they brought against Mr. Combs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal indictment alleged that Combs and his associates lured female victims, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Combs then allegedly used force, threats of force, coercion and controlled substances to get women to engage in sex acts with male prostitutes while he occasionally watched in gatherings that Combs referred to as freak-offs. Combs gave the women ketamine, ecstasy and GHB to keep them obedient and compliant during the performances, prosecutors said.\n\nCombs alleged criminal enterprise threatened and abused women and used members of his enterprise to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice, prosecutors said. In support of their racketeering case, prosecutors told jurors in opening statements that Combs was helped by a cadre of company employees, security staff and aides, who helped organize the freak-offs and then covered up the incidents.\n\nOverreach by government?\n\nThe government overreached. They wanted a RICO conviction so they could then go seize Combs assets under RICO forfeiture laws. Thats not going to happen now. This is a loss for the prosecution, Ring said, referring to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nThe prosecutions presentation was underwhelming. They made a number of strategic mistakes and unforced errors, former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani said in an interview before the verdict.\n\nAfter the verdict, Rahmani added: This was the most expensive prostitution trial in American history. What a huge win for the defense and a tremendous loss for the prosecution.\n\nSome experts say RICO cases are difficult to prosecute by design.\n\nRICO is a very rigid and difficult law to satisfy, said Mitchell Epner, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey who worked on numerous sex trafficking and involuntary servitude cases. It requires an ongoing criminal structure, a continuity of members of a criminal organization. It is on purpose difficult for prosecutors to prove, and the defense did a very good job of pointing out the shortcomings of a RICO prosecution on a technical level. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefense vs feds\n\nCombs attorneys hammered on the idea that their client was overcharged by prosecutors.\n\nMarc Agnifilo claimed Combs enjoyed a swinger lifestyle and was addled by drugs. He admitted Combs committed domestic violence, but that the racketeering and sex trafficking charges were trumped up.\n\nHe is not a racketeer, he said.\n\nProsecutors told the jury the evidence was clear.\n\nIn her closing argument, Assistant U.S. Atty. Christy Slavik said racketeering law applies when someone commits crimes as part of a group, and in Combs case, the defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses  the enterprise, she told jurors, according to AP.\n\nCombs counted on silence and shame to enable and prolong his abuse and used a small army of employees to harm women and cover it up, she said.\n\nUnder RICO, there are 35 specific offenses, including murder, bribery and extortion, and federal prosecutors need to show a pattern involving at least two overt acts as part of a criminal enterprise.\n\nThe defense questioned why those on the stand did not report the behavior to authorities at the time and in some cases stayed in Combs orbit.\n\nSmoking gun?\n\nJurors heard from 34 witnesses, who provided six weeks of brutal and graphic testimony.\n\nThe defense was aggressive in cross-examination, hammering witnesses about why they did not report Combs at the time or simply leave him. They also presented text messages of support and love after the alleged attacks. The defense also focused on the money and other things they got from Combs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isnt about a crime. This is about money. Its about money, Agnifilo said, according to the AP.\n\nThey also noted that witnesses did not believe they were committing a crime, making it hard to prove that Combs actions added up to a criminal conspiracy.\n\nVideo from 2016 showed Combs punching and kicking Ventura as she cowers and tries to protect herself in front of an L.A. hotel elevator bank. He then drags her down the hall by her hooded sweatshirt toward their hotel room.\n\nEddie Garcia, the InterContinental Hotel security guard, testified that Combs gave him a brown paper bag containing $100,000 in cash for the video.\n\nGarcia said that after his supervisor agreed to sell the video recording, he met with Combs, Combs chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, and a bodyguard. After Garcia raised concerns about the police, he said Combs called Ventura on FaceTime, handed him the phone and told Ventura to tell Garcia that she also wanted the video to go away. After that, Garcia said he took the money and split it with co-workers, according to reporting from inside the courtroom.\n\nProsecutors allege this shows the conspiracy.\n\nWhat does this mean for other cases?\n\nSome experts say the Combs verdict could put a chill on future sex trafficking prosecutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that the jury has acquitted Combs of the RICO and trafficking charges, Epner said, it could really cause the DOJ to think long and hard before bringing similar sex trafficking charges.\n\nThe verdict is also a bitter disappointment for victim advocates, said Lauren Hersh, the former chief of the sex trafficking unit at the Kings County district attorneys office in Brooklyn and now the national director of the activist group World Without Exploitation.\n\nAfter successful prosecutions of figures like R. Kelly and cult leader Keith Raniere, some experts saw progress in broadening the popular understanding of how sex trafficking operated and how victims might respond to it. With this verdict, though, this will 100% cast a chilling effect on prosecutors, who will be reluctant to bring similar charges even when the evidence is overwhelming, Hersh said.\n\n"

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Blink and you might have missed the Oklahoma City Thunder's coronation as NBA champions last week.\n\nBarely 24 hours after the Thunder's title parade capped the 2024-25 season, the 2025-26 offseason got underway with the NBA draft. That was followed Monday with the official opening of free agency.\n\nFree agency isn't the league-altering bonanza it was once because, instead of taking meetings with suitors as an unrestricted free agent on the open market, superstars now instead follow the trend of taking long-term, lucrative contract extensions.\n\nYet the offseason is still where championships can be won and lost. Look no further than Oklahoma City, whose title run was aided by the acquisitions of Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein a year earlier.\n\nNBC News is here to break down the major stories and signings of free agency so far.\n\nWhat was the best move of free agency so far?\n\nNadkarni: The Denver Nuggets trading Michael Porter Jr. and an unprotected 2032 first-round pick to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson was something of a triple whammy. First, it allowed the Nuggets to get off of Porter Jr.s massive salary, which was complicating how the team could build the roster. Second, Johnson is going to be a great fit in Denver. Hes a better defender than Porter Jr., and hes a more versatile offensive player while still being a great shooter. And lastly, the Nuggets immediately took advantage of the newfound flexibility of Johnsons cheaper contract to add more veteran pieces to the rotation. Without making the Porter Jr. trade, Denver may have been stuck all summer.\n\nGreif: Though Houston ended last season with the Wests second-best record, that seed didnt scare anybody entering the postseason; the Rockets were too inexperienced and untested and lost in the first round. Ever since, theyve acquired Kevin Durant for pennies on the dollar, added free agent Dorian Finney-Smith  a signing that weakens his former team, the Lakers  re-signed young talents in Jabari Smith Jr. and JaeSean Tate and also Steven Adams, their revitalized big man, and retained guard Fred VanVleet on a team-friendly extension.\n\nAll of it positions the Rockets to be legitimately the second-best team in the West next season behind Oklahoma City. In many ways, how Houston has approached this offseason reminds me exactly of Oklahoma City did last year at this time. Coming off a promising regular season in which they vaulted to the top of the West, the Thunder lost earlier than expected in the playoffs and used that information about what went wrong to smartly add their missing pieces. No ones saying next season will end with a title as this season did for the Thunder, but this offseason has put Houston legitimately in the conversation.\n\nWhat was the biggest head-scratching move?\n\nNadkarni: There is only one correct answer here, and thats the Milwaukee Bucks waiving and stretching Damian Lillards contract, meaning the Bucks will pay roughly $22.6 million over the next five seasons for Lillard not to be on the team. Weve literally never seen a team stretch a contract this big before, and the ramifications  while ultimately unclear  will be felt for the rest of the decade.\n\nAs a runner-up, though, Ill add in the entire New Orleans Pelicans offseason. For some reason they traded away C.J. McCollums expiring deal for an extra year of Jordan Poole while also dealing away a very valuable 2026 first-round pick to move up for Maryland big man Derik Queen. I have no clue what this team thinks it is or what it wants to be.\n\nGreif: Milwaukees decision to waive injured guard Damian Lillard in order to make room for former Pacers center Myles Turner. Reasonable people can conclude that the All-Star pairing of Lillard and big man Giannis Antetokounmpo had not worked as expected. Yet to move on, the Bucks chose a route that makes it very difficult to upgrade their roster in the future  $22 million of their salary cap for the next five years will go to Lillard, a player not even on their roster  all without much of a guarantee it will turn them into title contenders in the present. Turner is younger than Brook Lopez, the outgoing Bucks center who left for the Los Angeles Clippers, but underwhelmed during the NBA Finals with Indiana. The ultimate goal, of course, for Milwaukee is keeping Antetokounmpo happy enough that the franchise cornerstone doesnt demand a trade. Well see by next seasons trade deadline how happy he truly is.\n\nWhich team has been the biggest winner?\n\nNadkarni: What the Hawks have done under new general manager Onsi Saleh has been remarkable. With Trae Young in the final year of his contract before a playoff option, Saleh has surrounded him with arguably the best talent of his career. Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard were brought in to join Dyson Daniels and Jalen Johnson in the wing rotation, giving Atlanta head coach Quin Snyder a ton of optionality for his lineups this season. Need more defense? Play Johnson, Daniels and NAW together. Need more shooting? Put Kennard on the floor along with center Kristaps Porzingis, who was acquired via trade from Boston.\n\nPorzingis could really take this team to another level if he stays healthy. With Onyeka Okongwu still in the mix, Porzingis should not have to carry a major load during the regular season. This is a really well-constructed team. If anyone can go on a Pacers-like run, its the Hawks.\n\nGreif: The honor of most impressive offseason so far is a tie between Denver and Atlanta. Both teams are under new front-office management and both are going for it. The Nuggets' ownership doesn't have a free-spending reputation, so kudos to allowing their new basketball operations leadership to build around all-world superstar Nikola Jokic in his prime by bringing back Bruce Brown, a critical piece of their 2023 championship roster, and trading Michael Porter Jr. for Cam Johnson.\n\nIn a depleted Eastern Conference that feels up for grabs after superstar injuries derailed Indiana and Bostons title ambitions next season, Atlanta is quietly positioning itself to become a contender. Nickeil Alexander-Walker adds a dependable ballhandler with playoff experience. Luke Kennard is one of the NBAs best shooters when playing with confidence, and if the Hawks coaching staff can get him to not pass up shots, his one-year deal is a steal. The high-risk, high-reward wild card is former Boston big man Kristaps Porzingis, who is coming off a mysterious ailment. Less than a year ago, Atlanta felt on the verge of blowing up its roster and giving up on Trae Young as a cornerstone. Now, its oriented its whole roster around Young. Lets see what happens.\n\nWhich team has been the biggest loser?\n\nNadkarni: What are the Los Angeles Lakers doing? Sometimes it feels this team has been moderately successful the last few seasons in spite of their front office, which is routinely gifted star players and then makes baffling roster decisions.\n\nThe Lakers lost Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency, and havent replaced him on the wing. Finney-Smith played with Luka Doncic in Dallas, and is the exact type of 3-and-D wing who can succeed off Luka and LeBron James. So thats a big hole on the roster.\n\nAnd to address the center position, Los Angeles is rolling the dice on Deandre Ayton, who has been inconsistent at best the last three seasons, and at worst a teammate whom multiple franchises couldnt wait to get rid of. Thats the guy who is supposed to get Doncic to stay and inspire confidence in a 40-year-old James?\n\nThe Lakers have Luka and LeBron, yet it feels they arent close to the top of the West.\n\nGreif: The Los Angeles Lakers. This was a team that, late last season, looked as though it had a punchers chance in the West. Since getting beaten in the opening round by Minnesota, theyve watched Oklahoma City gain confidence and a championship, stood by idly in free agency as contenders Houston and Denver get deeper and more dangerous, all while losing Dorian Finney-Smith, a key rotation piece during the playoffs.\n\nThough the Lakers finally added a center, they did so while becoming the latest team to pray that center Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 pick in the 2018 draft, fulfills the potential that went unrealized previously in Phoenix and Portland. Much of the optimism around the Lakers last season came from the pairing of LeBron James, who was still playing at an all-NBA level 22 seasons into his career, with Luka Doncic. But after James opted into the final year of his contract with a statement from his agent that raised speculation about how badly James wants to be a Laker this season, how long will that core duo stay together?\n\nIs there a move you want to see?\n\nNadkarni: I want to see the Pacers do...something. The last couple weeks have been devastating for Indiana. Star Tyrese Haliburton tears his Achilles in Game 7 of the Finals, and then the team lost center Myles Turner to the rival Bucks  in part because the Pacers didnt want to pay up for their longest tenured player.\n\nTaking something of a gap year kind of makes sense for Indiana. But after that magical run in the playoffs, Pacers fans deserve a little something to hang their hat on this summer. Though its wise for Indiana not to make a big swing, I hope the team finds a way to make its upcoming season a little more interesting in the wake of whats happened with Haliburton and Turner.\n\nGreif: Chris Paul landing with a team that has a shot at contention. While it has been nice to see Paul, who turned 40, seemingly embrace mentorship this late in his career  having helped a young Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in Oklahoma City in 2020, then Victor Wembanyama last season in San Antonio  its not because hes become some rotational afterthought. Last season, he played all 82 games and can still hit that elbow jumper automatically.\n\nWouldnt it be fun to see his cutthroat competitiveness in play on a contender again? The question is how far from Los Angeles, where his family lives, he would be willing to go to chase a ring."

        "content": "Soldiers from the Army 82nd Airborne Division, dressed in World War I-era uniforms, march past the reviewing stand and President Trump during a military parade commemorating the Armys 250th anniversary, coinciding with his 79th birthday.\n\nThousands of President Trumps supporters descended on the nations capital Saturday for a parade marking the 250th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Army, a rare spectacle of military hardware and uniformed soldiers filing down American streets.\n\nThe festivities, scheduled to coincide with Trumps 79th birthday as well as Flag Day, drew as much MAGA paraphernalia as American flags to Constitution Avenue. Attendees who spoke with The Times all expressed support for the president.\n\nBut outside the expansive security perimeter for the event, in downtown Washington and beyond in cities across the country, demonstrations of the No Kings movement against Trumps rule countered his military display with a show of defiance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parade kicked off early, with Trump leaving the White House for the festivities roughly 45 minutes ahead of schedule over weather concerns. He arrived to rapturous applause from the modestly sized crowd roughly 30 minutes before a light rain began. An opening video montage celebrating the Army made no mention of Trump, although videos aired at the Mall festival ahead of the official program did include images of the president in MAGA gear.\n\nPresident Trump salutes as he attends Saturdays military parade commemorating the Armys 250th anniversary and coinciding with his 79th birthday.

A federal judge on Thursday ruled that the deployment had violated the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the official program for the parade, drafted by the Army, offered wholesome patriotism to viewers and spectators that lent an Independence Day spirit to the festivities.\n\nA narrator walked through the history of the U.S. military as weapons and uniforms from each American war, starting with the Revolution, was marched past a podium where the president sat, alongside the first lady, vice president and secretary of Defense, among others.\n\nA parachute team jumped from the skies over the mall, historic aircraft flew overhead, and modern tanks rolled by throughout the evening. Dozens of planes and helicopters, hundreds of vehicles and thousands of troops participated in the event  just a preview of the festivities expected next year, when the nation marks 250 years since the United States declared independence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA No Kings protest in Chicago. (Nam Y. Huh / Associated Press)\n\nTrump had sought a military parade ever since his first term, when he fawned over the sight of a military march down the Champs-lyses during a Bastille Day celebration in Paris. Saturdays event, according to an Army spokesperson, will cost between $25 million and $45 million, depending on how much damage the tanks inflict on D.C. roads.\n\nMost revelers were enthusiastic at the sight of hardware that rarely makes it out for public viewing. Several attendees expressed excitement at the opportunity to celebrate the sacrifices and accomplishments of the Army.\n\nAshton Earl, 30, a legislative assistant who lives in the district, stood at the edge of the parade route holding his 3-year-old daughter, Carol, up in his arms while his 4-year-old son, Hiram, sat on his shoulders, so they could both see the tanks rolling by.\n\nBoth of them seemed to be loving the show  and being there with Grandma, their dads mom, Beth, who stood with them.\n\nEarl said it had been a great event for the family.\n\nFor one, kids love trucks, he said with a smile.\n\nOne of the great things about living in D.C. is you get to show your kids things theyd never see anywhere else in the country, he added. I love my country, and I want them to as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the midst of supporters, near the main bandstand, stood Kathy Straus, 63, of Richmond, Va. Straus held a protest sign reading, $45 Million = 1 Parade or Feeding 18,000 Vets for 1 Yr.\n\nI think we can spend our dollars a little more conscientiously, she said, adding, I thought it was more important to share this message with people who are of a different mindset than me.\n\nAhead of the start of the parade on Saturday, visitors posed alongside tanks, jeeps and other military vehicles parked along the Mall, part of a large festival area between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. One stand near the Mall offered shirts for sale reading The Big, Beautiful Military Parade, a reference to the similarly named spending bill that Trump is championing in Congress.\n\nAfter waiting in long lines, people cleared security checkpoints where they passed through metal detectors and had their bags  limited in size  checked by law enforcement. Inside, troops handed out bottled water for free from tents. Take as many as you want, one said. Stay hydrated.\n\nHats and other expressions of support for President Trump were popular among members of the crowd on the National Mall. (Jacquelyn Martin / Associated Press)\n\nPaul Brown, a 57-year-old Army veteran, had driven to the event from Ohio. On Saturday, he wore a shirt that said, Jesus is my savior. Trump is my president, and a hat reading, Afghanistan War Veteran, U.S. Army.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown said he served from 2010-16, and deployed to Afghanistan for nine months in 2012 and 2013 before being medically retired.

And if other countries are watching, theyll see we can flex our muscles, too, if we have to.\n\nOf criticisms that such parades arent commonly held in America, he said, thats the problem  its something America should have been doing.\n\nThe president has had a complicated relationship with the military. During his first term, Trump called service members killed in combat suckers and losers, according to his former chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly.

The No Kings protests brought out more than 2 million Americans to protest Trumps rule, according to their organizers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReal power isnt staged in Washington, the groups website read ahead of the event. It rises up everywhere else.\n\nHundreds of thousands came out to demonstrate as part of the movement across Southern California, with additional large gatherings taking place in Philadelphia, New York and other major cities. But protesters turned out in smaller cities, as well, including some in the most conservative states in the country.\n\nNo Kings protesters gather in front of the Capitol in Boise, Idaho, on Saturday. (Maria L. LaGanga / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn Idaho, where Trump prevailed with 67% of the vote in November, more than a dozen No Kings rallies were scheduled. In Boise, a couple thousand protesters had gathered in front of the state Capitol building by 1 p.m., and crowds were still streaming in.\n\nThere were sun hats and kids in strollers, wheelchairs and mountain bikes. American flags fluttered, along with the occasional LGBTQ+ banner. A single Mexican flag was wrapped around a young womans shoulders. Law enforcement kept a low profile, and there were no obvious counter-protesters by the time speeches began.\n\nLes Herman, a 74-year-old Boise resident, joined the boisterous rally, he said, because this country has gone too far right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIm a Vietnam veteran, he continued. This is personal. I went to a war that was unpopularI didnt live to come back to see what I see today.\n\nMirren Henny, a 27-year-old transplant from Glendora, texted back and forth with her parents, who were attending similar rallies in California, sharing photos of their signs. Hennys said, Lady Liberty Welcomes the Tired not the Tyrants on one side, JD Vance ate my cat on the other.\n\nIm here because I oppose a lot of what Trumps imposing, she said as the crowd chanted, No kings! No kings! No kings! Its really scary.\n\nThe Trump administration said it welcomes peaceful protests throughout the country. But that White House commitment was called into question when a federal judge in California ruled Thursday that Trump had violated the law by federalizing the National Guard in response to largely peaceful demonstrations in Los Angeles protesting its immigration enforcement tactics.\n\nIn the ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said he was troubled by the implication inherent in the Trump administrations argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion.\n\nTrump wrested control over the National Guard troops from California Gov. Gavin Newsom to deploy 2,000 to Los Angeles after less than 24 hours of protests across the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands more were later called to Los Angeles, as were hundreds of Marines.\n\nLate Thursday, following an appeal by the administration, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals put Breyers decision on hold, leaving the forces in L.A. under Trumps control as the litigation continues.\n\nMilitary vehicles cross over the Potomac River into Washington for the parade commemorating the Armys 250th anniversary and coinciding with President Trumps 79th birthday. (Stephanie Scarbrough / Associated Press)\n\nThe legality of Trumps troop display in Washington was never challenged. But concerns persisted leading up to the parade inside the military that the visual of an Army march in Washington, at Trumps request, could feed into fears over the politicization of the military amid the ongoing crisis in Los Angeles.\n\nCritics of the administration also expressed unease over their presence in an American city, blasting the parade as the sort of spectacle more expected from countries like Russia, China and North Korea.\n\nSecurity measures around the event were similar to those put in place during other major events in Washingtons downtown core since Trumps supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed attempt to keep Trump in office after his 2020 loss to President Biden.\n\nThe insurrection caused widespread damage to the Capitol and put many lawmakers at risk. Trump pardoned all of the Jan. 6 defendants shortly after he was reelected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeanette Mangia, 46, stood on the National Mall on Saturday afternoon waiting for a friend  a fellow J6er, as she put it.\n\nMangia was among those charged with participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection. She faced a dozen charges, including multiple assault charges, she told The Times, and was in jail for seven months before Trump won reelection and issued the pardons.\n\nShe had driven down from Pennsylvania for the parade. It was her first time back in Washington since her release, she said.\n\nIt feels kind of strange, know what I mean? she said, pointing around the Mall. I seen these streets every time I went back and forth to court from jail.\n\nMangia had a Trump 2028 hat on, and said she wants him to run again  which the Constitution forbids  if theres no better option.\n\nHes the lesser of two evils, thats for sure, she said.\n\nShe was hoping to meet up with a group of other so-called J6ers on Saturday to make some kind of statement about their deserving compensation for being jailed, she said. Some people want millions. I dont want that, she added. I just want to be made whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaria L.

        "content": "Brian Camenker is used to being on the losing side of the same-sex marriage debate.\n\nHe fought unsuccessfully for years to reverse his home-state Massachusetts decision in 2004 to legalize same-sex marriages, the first state in the union to do so. He grew even more determined after the Supreme Courts Obergefell v. Hodges decision in June 2015 established a federal right to marry, a ruling that Mr. Camenker calls fundamentally flawed.\n\nMr. Camenkers organization, MassResistance, is among a constellation of conservative, mostly evangelical groups that is laying the groundwork for a long-shot legal push to try to get the Supreme Court to roll back Obergefell. They argue that the social and legal pressure to accept same-sex marriages is undermining religious liberty and the traditional family, and that states should reclaim authority to regulate such unions, just as they now do for abortion.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Its been a decade since the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed a right to same-sex marriage. Public acceptance has grown since then, but some conservatives aim to challenge that ruling in an echo of what happened with Roe v. Wade.\n\nSimply put, Obergefell, in their eyes, was a mistake. And what the Supreme Court giveth it can take away.\n\nAll you have to do is persuade five of the nine judges, says Mr. Camenker.\n\nCourtesy of Brian Camenker Brian Camenker, founder and director of MassResistance, a conservative advocacy organization, addresses a meeting in this undated photo. Mr. Camenker has worked with Republican state lawmakers to introduce resolutions opposing the 2015 Obergefell ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that created a federal right to same-sex marriage.\n\nRolling back same-sex marriage rights is not something that the Republican Party at large  or President Donald Trump  particularly wants to take on. Public opinion, party leadership, votes in Congress, and legal scholarship all suggest that opponents of same-sex marriage face a severe uphill battle. Even before the Obergefell ruling, polling showed a majority of Americans supported the right of same-sex couples to marry, and a surge in same-sex marriages since then appears to have boosted public approval and reinforced a view in Washington that what was once a powerful wedge issue now has mainstream acceptance.\n\nTo many who defend same-sex marriage, opposition by people like Mr. Camenker appears rooted in bigotry. Some watchdog organizations label MassResistance a hate group.\n\nMr. Camenker and his allies say their movement is based on traditions tethered to biology, societys reliance on marriage as a support for child-rearing, and natural law  plus, for many, proscriptions in the Bible.\n\nWhen marriage is redefined, fatherhood and motherhood are deemed optional, and it is children who suffer, Arthur Schaper, field director for MassResistance, told a North Dakota state legislative committee in February.\n\nEarlier this month, the Southern Baptists passed a resolution at an annual convention held in Dallas to oppose Obergefell and other laws that defy Gods design for marriage and family.\n\nRichard W. Rodriguez/AP Southern Baptist Convention President Clint Pressley gives the President's Address during the 2025 SBC Annual Meeting, June 10 in Dallas.\n\nBackers of the resolution are aware of the uphill nature of their battle. The nonbinding resolution is an effort to keep the conversation alive, its author, Andrew Walker, a Baptist from Kentucky, told The New York Times.\n\nIn 2022, Congress voted to codify same-sex marriages in a bill that passed with bipartisan support. The Respect for Marriage Act replaced the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which had defined marriage as between one man and one woman. Similar language was officially removed just last year from the Republican Party platform, which had previously castigated Obergefell as robbing Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as heterosexual.\n\nBut opponents see a new opening, fueled by anti-woke politics on the right and a broader rejection among independents and even some Democrats of new left-wing orthodoxy on gender and identity. Beneath the surface of public acceptance of same-sex marriage, they believe, lie a widening partisan divide and a conservative reaction against societys leftward shift on LGBTQ+ rights and gender roles, which could be mobilized in a campaign against Obergefell. And the Supreme Courts Dobbs decision in 2022, overturning a national right to abortion that had held for five decades, showed that the most dogged climbers sometimes do eventually reach the summit.\n\nThere is a sense of at least some momentum on the far right for trying to gut those marriage protections, says Melissa Deckman, chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute.\n\nMs. Deckman says PRRIs polling shows that while theres broad support for same-sex marriage, there has been a collapse of support among young Republicans in recent years. In 2020, about 64% of Republicans between the ages of 18 and 29 supported marriage equality, compared with 83% of Democrats. In 2024, Democrats views were almost unchanged, but only 51% of young Republicans approved. Young men were more likely to disapprove than young women.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP/File Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California (center), Senate Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York (center left), and other members of Congress react after she signed the Respect for Marriage Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec. 8, 2022.\n\nSimilarly, a Harvard Youth Poll that surveyed more than 2,000 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 in March 2025 found a sharp partisan divide: Fifty-two percent of Republican respondents said same-sex marriage was morally wrong, compared with 11% of Democrats. According to Gallup, there is a 47-point gap between Republicans and Democrats on approval of marriage equality, the highest since it began tracking this measure in 1996. Gallup found that Republican support in 2025 had fallen to 41%, down from a 55% peak in 2022 but still above the 30% level in July 2015.\n\nSeeking change at the state level first\n\nSince the 2015 Obergefell ruling, the Supreme Court has moved to the right, a shift that President Trump engineered in his first term when he appointed three conservative justices. Those justices later delivered the reversal of Roe v. Wade that Mr. Trump had promised to Evangelicals and other social conservatives who voted for him in 2016. In a concurrent opinion for the Dobbs ruling, Judge Clarence Thomas wrote that Obergefell could be overturned on similar grounds as Roe since a right to marry is neither in the Constitution nor deeply rooted in U.S. history.\n\nThose seeking to overturn Obergefell closely match those who patiently worked for Roes demise. The Southern Baptist network of mostly white evangelical churches, which has more than 12 million members and is aligned with the Republican Party, has long served as a base of support for the anti-abortion movement.\n\nMr. Trump has shown no interest, however, in reversing Obergefell. As a candidate last year, he excoriated transgender rights and diversity programs, but not same-sex marriages, a choice that speaks to a political consensus that extends to some, if not all, of his MAGA base. Trump is reluctant to fully embrace the culture wars when politically its unpopular, says Ms. Deckman.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP/File Donald Trump holds a flag as he arrives at to a campaign rally at the University of Northern Colorado, Oct. 30, 2016, in Greeley, Colorado.\n\nMr. Camenker agrees that Mr. Trump isnt an ally on this issue, and that the president seems more interested in courting LGBTQ+ donors, as he did in December 2022 at a celebration of gay rights held at Mar-a-Lago. The event was a gala for Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative LGBTQ+ group. We are fighting for the gay community, Mr. Trump told the tuxedoed guests.\n\nPresident Trump has been terrible on this issue, Mr. Camenker says.\n\nSo this year his organization took another tack: drafting resolutions for GOP state lawmakers who oppose same-sex marriage. Nonbinding resolutions calling for a reversal of Obergefell were introduced by lawmakers in statehouses in Montana, Idaho, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Michigan, though none were passed or signed into law.\n\nMr. Camenker describes the resolutions as a way to show the Supreme Court how states feel about the issue. They have some legitimacy, he says. In public hearings, MassResistance officials told lawmakers that states should reclaim their authority to restore the natural order of marriage and claimed that strong families had been eroded by the courts ruling.\n\nAround half of all states have constitutional or statutory bans, or other limits, on same-sex marriages. Should the Supreme Court end a federal right to marry, these laws would take effect, though these states would still be required to recognize same-sex couples who married in other states under the Respect for Marriage Act that President Joe Biden signed in 2022.\n\nJosh Schriver, a Republican lawmaker in Michigan, introduced an anti-Obergefell resolution in February that drew swift condemnation from Democratic lawmakers and from officials, including Attorney General Dana Nessel, the first LGBTQ+ person elected to a statewide position in Michigan. Im not giving up the fight to maintain [marriage equality], and Im ... not giving up this ring, Ms. Nessel said in a video posted on the social platform X, showing her ring finger.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Schriver described the 2015 Supreme Court ruling as a judicial imposition that disrupted the moral framework necessary for a stable and flourishing society. He said his resolution would restore order and end an aberration that wasnt a settled norm.\n\nIf we are serious about preserving the legacy of Western civilization, then restoring foundational institutions like marriage is essential, he told the Monitor.\n\nA legal showdown\n\nOverturning Obergefell would require a constitutional case to be litigated and appealed before it could reach the Supreme Court; state resolutions that challenge rulings carry no legal weight. The court only addresses concrete disputes ... not theoretical requests, says Daniel Pinello, a political scientist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nOne such case involves Kim Davis, a clerk in Kentucky who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses and was sued in 2015. A petition filed by Liberty Counsel, an evangelical law firm, seeks a review of her case with the explicit goal of overruling Obergefell. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently denied a request to overturn a civil verdict against her.\n\nAny legal showdown could be years away, says Mr. Camenker, though he takes encouragement from Justice Thomas Dobbs opinion and hopes that states will eventually regain authority over who is permitted to marry. People shouldnt be forced to accept gay marriage, he says.\n\nHe denies that the public has come to accept these unions. What the Supreme Court has done, he says, is force everyone else to accept this. Every business has to accept this. Every school has to teach that its legitimate.\n\nHe adds, Homosexuality is naturally abhorrent to people, and it always has been.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has described MassResistance as an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group. Mr. Camenker says his group is a pro-family organization that advocates on many issues, not just same-sex marriage.\n\nProfessor Pinello, who has written several books on and advocated for marriage equality, says he used to consider Obergefell the final word and to be settled law. The 2022 Dobbs decision changed his calculus, though, as a federal right seen as inviolable was taken away.\n\nYet the reactions to the same ruling and to revelations about justices accepting gifts from wealthy donors also put some pressure on the court for restraint. I still think Obergefell is going to remain in place, if for no other reason than the Dobbs decision had a devastating impact on public opinion of the Supreme Court, he says."

Mayor Karen Bass, not known as a public brawler until recently , is ducking punches and throwing her own jabs and uppercuts.\n\nShe has accused President Trump of initiating the protests he condemned, and called Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a liar for suggesting L.A. was a city of mayhem .\n\nI had a conversation with her Tuesday about what its like to deal with a president like this one, but before we chatted, she stepped to the podium at City Hall, flanked by labor, business and faith leaders, and defended her turf again .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is essentially an all-out assault against Los Angeles, Bass said, denouncing the U.S. Justice Departments lawsuit accusing her and the City Council of hindering the battle against a crisis of illegal immigration. Its a political stunt, Bass said several times, denying that the citys sanctuary city protections are unlawful.\n\nSteve Lopez Steve Lopez is a California native who has been a Los Angeles Times columnist since 2001. He has won more than a dozen national journalism awards and is a four-time Pulitzer finalist. Read more from Steve Lopez\n\nWe know that Los Angeles is the test case, Bass said. And we will stand strong, and we do so because the people snatched off city streets and chased through parking lots are our neighbors, our family members, and they are Angelenos. Let me be clear. I wont be intimidated.\n\nThis has not been the best year of Bass political career. It began with the destruction of Pacific Palisades by a wildfire that started while Bass was out of town, and continued with the second-guessing of L.A.s disaster preparedness and questions about who would lead the rebuilding effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrow in the lingering catastrophe of widespread homelessness and wrangling over a city budget deficit , and it was looking as though Bass might be vulnerable in a 2026 reelection bid.\n\nThen came the arrival of federal agents and troops, with raids beginning June 6, and Bass started to find her footing by going against type.\n\nHer natural instinct is to be a coalition builder  to govern by consensus, said Fernando Guerra, a political science professor at Loyola Marymount University. But that doesnt work with Trump, so shes recalibrating and saying, you know, the only thing this guy understands is confrontation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPomona College politics professor Sara Sadhwani said Trump is attacking the heart and core of Los Angeles, and there may be unintended consequences, given the way the presidents actions are unifying many Angelenos. I think the vast majority of folks in Los Angeles, but also throughout the state, can agree that whats happening now is not OK and runs counter to our values, Sadhwani continued. And Bass is showing incredibly strong leadership.\n\nPresident Trump shook hands with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass after a fire briefing in Pacific Palisades on Jan. 24. (Mark Schiefelbein / Associated Press)\n\nEven a half dozen Republican state legislators have joined the opposition, sending a letter to Trump suggesting he focus on arresting actual criminals rather than going after people who make up an essential component of the economy.\n\nAs Sadhwani noted, Republican lawmakers for years have lamented federal overreach and argued in favor of states rights and local control. And yet the Trump Administration is set on telling California and Los Angeles how to govern themselves, most recently on sanctuary protections, despite court arguments that theyre protected under the 10th Amendment.\n\nAfter Tuesdays press conference, Bass retreated to her office and told me her support for immigrants began with her work as an activist in the 1970s.\n\nThis is fundamentally who I am. But of course, having a blended family  also factors into her politics on immigration. My ex-husband was a Chicano activist  I have other family members that are married to people from the Philippines, Korea, Japan. I have a Greek side to my family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen gathered, she said, her family looks like the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\nAnd thats what Los Angeles looks like, with storylines that crisscross the globe and transcend borders.\n\nI dont see anybody [here] anywhere calling for deportations, whereas you could imagine in some cities this would be a very divisive issue, Bass said.\n\nI told her I hear quite often from people asking: What dont you understand about the word illegal? or from people arguing that their relatives waited and immigrated legally.\n\nI understand those perspectives, I told Bass. But I also understand context  namely, the desire of people to seek better opportunities for their children, and the lure of doing so in a United States that relies upon immigrant labor and tacitly allows it while hypocritically condemning it.\n\nWhile serving in Congress, Bass said, she witnessed the toll wrought by the separation of families along the border. She met people who carried the trauma throughout their lives, the insecurity, the feeling of abandonment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the very least, the mayor said, federal agents should identify themselves and they also should have warrants, and they should stop randomly picking people up off the street. The original intent, remember, [was to go after] the hardened criminals. Where are the hardened criminals? Theyre chasing them through parking lots at Home Depot? Theyre washing cars? I dont think so.\n\nU.S. Marines post guard at the Federal Building at the corner of Veteran Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles on June 19. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of arrestees in Los Angeles have no criminal records .\n\nAs for the cost of the raids in L.A.  by an administration that made a vow to shrink government  Bass wanted to make a few points.\n\nYou think about the young men and women in the National Guard. They leave their families, work, their school. For what? she asked. Its a misuse of the troops. And the same thing with the Marines. Theyre not trained to deal with anything happening on the street. Theyre trained to fight to kill the enemy in foreign lands.\n\nWhile we were talking, Bass got an urgent call from her daughter, Yvette Lechuga, who works as senior administrative assistant at Mount St. Marys University. Lechuga said a woman was apprehended while getting off a shuttle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seems like ICE grabbed our student, Lechuga said.\n\nBass said her staff would look into it.\n\nWe were on quasi-lockdown for a while, Lechuga said.\n\nJesus Christ, said the mayor.\n\nsteve.lopez@latimes.com"

        "content": "Israels preliminary analysis of the damage caused by U.S. strikes on Irans main nuclear facilities  based in part on assessments on the ground  shows the attacks inflicted widespread destruction, a senior Israeli official said.\n\nThe official, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said that Tehran has been actively trying to hide the damage from the Sunday attacks, which President Trump said in The Hague on Wednesday had all but eliminated Irans enrichment program.\n\nTrump, who repeatedly defended the effectiveness of the strikes at the NATO summit, made reference to individuals who had been on the ground to assess the damage, without providing details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI cant say its a final assessment, because were less than a week after, the Israeli official said. Its not like we can send officers openly. But thats the indication we have now.\n\nA spokesperson for Irans Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said the bombing raid badly damaged the nuclear sites, but the Iranian government has said it will continue its nuclear efforts, which it insists are for peaceful purposes.\n\nA full review of the mission could take weeks, and experts have expressed skepticism of declarations by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that the U.S. operation was a success within mere days of the attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBattlefield damage assessment is an imprecise art, with initial estimates frequently being way off, said Patrick Clawson, an expert on Iran and director for research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. I would be very suspicious of any claims  by Iran, by Trump, by Israel  about what has happened to Irans enriched uranium stocks or to its centrifuges.\n\nIsraels preliminary findings come after an initial assessment from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency cast doubt on the effectiveness of the American strikes. The U.S. intelligence agency said that, based on what it knew at the time, it believed that Iran had retained the core elements of its nuclear program despite the attack. The agencys assessment was first reported by CNN.\n\nThe U.S. strikes came after nine days of an Israeli military campaign that decimated Irans air defenses, its military leadership and its ballistic missile stockpiles, while degrading its nuclear facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsraeli intelligence has also monitored the reaction to the campaign among Iranian leadership, which has struggled to comprehend the extent of the damage, the Israeli official said.\n\nWe dont believe everyone in the leadership knows what really happened, because the whole program was compartmentalized  they werent sharing a lot of information, and a lot of the officers who were highly involved on the ground level were eliminated, the official continued. So a lot of the top leadership hasnt fully begun to understand whats happened.\n\nThe developing intelligence picture comes as Trump defended the U.S. mission, called Operation Midnight Hammer, during multiple appearances at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in The Hague on Wednesday.\n\nIts been obliterated, totally obliterated, he said of Irans nuclear facilities. Addressing the U.S. intelligence report, he added: They did a report, but it was like, if you look at the dates, its just a few days after.\n\nThe U.S. deployment of massive bunker buster munitions targeting Irans main nuclear sites  including six dropped on Fordo, a facility burrowed deep into the side of a mountain  was intended to bury its most advanced equipment and most highly enriched uranium, which can be used to build nuclear warheads.\n\nInitial assessments of the damage were unclear, but since then, Trump said, weve collected additional intelligence. Weve also spoken to people that have seen the site, and the site is obliterated."

        "content": "WASHINGTON  The Republican-controlled House on Thursday passed a multitrillion-dollar package of tax cuts and spending, sending the bill to President Donald Trumps desk after a tense 24 hours of negotiations and arm-twisting.\n\nThe mostly party-line vote of 218-214 came one day ahead of Trumps July 4 deadline and caps an arduous process that lasted more than four months, rife with ideological clashes and acrimony between the House and Senate, where Republicans had little margin for error given their narrow majorities.\n\nIn the end, the GOP largely unified to pack the bulk of Trumps domestic agenda into a single measure, with just Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., voting against it. A bloc of Republican holdouts had initially opposed a procedural vote Wednesday to advance the bill, leading to an hourslong overnight standoff. But Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., managed to sway all but one of them, teeing up final passage in the House.\n\nTrump is now expected to sign the bill into law on Independence Day, marking the partys biggest legislative accomplishment since taking full control of Washington in January.\n\nThe 887-page package , dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" extends the tax cuts Trump enacted in 2017, while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay. It approves hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending on the military and to carry out Trumps mass deportation plans. And it partially pays for all that with steep cuts to Medicaid, food aid benefits and clean energy funding. That includes an estimated $930 billion in spending reductions under Medicaid, violating Trump's promise not to cut the program.\n\nOverall, the bill is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over a decade, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finding that the revenue losses of $4.5 trillion outstrip the spending cuts of $1.2 trillion. The bill also increases the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.\n\nThroughout the process, Republican leaders had an ace in the hole to corral the votes even as the competing demands of rival factions appeared irreconcilable: They knew their members wouldnt ultimately say no to Trump, from the most conservative to the least ideological and politically vulnerable.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have succeeded in our mission to enact President Trumps America First agenda, Johnson said in joint statement with his leadership team. And importantly, we did it in record time, so that the effects of this nation-shaping legislation can be felt by the American people as soon as possible.\n\nRepublicans often turned to Trump throughout the process to help close the deal on key votes. He regularly held meetings with and made phone calls with key lawmakers, while issuing the occasional threat on Truth Social to holdouts who stood in the bills way. Vice President JD Vance was also a regular presence in Senate and House meetings around the bill.\n\nIf President Trump and Vice President Vance had not engaged at the time they did, it wouldnt have passed, said conservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who attended White House meetings in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room on Wednesday and ultimately voted for the bill.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the wee hours of the morning, Johnson said Trump had been making phone calls to recalcitrant holdouts as late as 1 a.m. Thursday to help break an impasse on the floor.\n\nHe doesnt really sleep a lot, said Johnson, who also dangled the prospect of future bills to address concerns and demands from a variety of members.\n\nIn his 1 a.m. call with holdouts, Trump and other White House officials made promises to aggressively implement key provisions in the bill  from clean energy tax credit phase outs to new Medicaid restrictions, a source familiar with the call said.\n\nOne by one, the GOP critics folded and accepted demands they insisted they wouldnt. Conservatives swallowed a bill that adds trillions to the debt. Politically vulnerable Republicans endorsed steep cuts to Medicaid and health care spending that are projected by CBO to cost 11.8 million people their insurance. Republicans whose districts and states benefit from clean energy incentives ended up voting to strip them away.\n\nTheyre just afraid of Trump and the backlash that would ensue if he called them out, Massie, who opposed the bill, told NBC News the day before the final vote. Im not concerned.\n\nTrump and his allies sought to strike fear in GOP lawmakers by vowing to support a primary challenger to Massie in his next election. Massie, who objected to the large deficit increase in the bill, said Trumps real goal was to keep other Republicans in line by sending a message that defying him comes with political pain.\n\nTheyre whipping this horse, because Im out of the barn, to keep the other horses in the barn, he said.\n\nFitzpatrick, who represents a swing district, said the steeper Medicaid cuts, in addition to several other Senate provisions, moved him from supporting an earlier version of the bill to opposing the final one.\n\nI believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community, he said in a statement. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.\n\nLater, on the 1 a.m. call with Trump, Massie remarked how it'd be nice if Trump stopped attacking him, the source said, then flipped from no to yes on the key procedural vote.\n\nThe House took up the bill after the Senate voted 51-50 to pass the legislation on Tuesday, with Vance breaking the tie. The only Republicans who voted against it were Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Thom Tillis, R-N.C. and Susan Collins, R-Maine. The party used the filibuster-proof budget reconciliation process to get around the 60-vote threshold, which meant that some non-budgetary provisions were stripped out.\n\nEvery Democrat in both chambers voted against the bill, blasting it as a tax cut for the wealthy that is paid for by cutting programs like Medicaid that benefit the working class. They plan to place a heavy focus on the bill in their message to voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, emboldened by polls showing that the legislation is unpopular.\n\nAt the start of a record-breaking floor speech Thursday morning that lasted for 8 hours and 44 minutes, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., ripped what he called the big, ugly bill, this disgusting abomination, and accused Republicans of working through the night to pass it because it would kick millions of Americans off Medicaid and food stamps. Republicans argued that work requirements would target waste, fraud and abuse in those programs.\n\nWhy did debate begin at 3:28 a.m. in the morning? Jeffries asked with House Democrats filling the seats behind him. Republicans are once again, which has been the case, Mr. Speaker, through every step of this journey, trying to jam this bill through the House of Representatives under cover of darkness.\n\nRepublicans began making plans for their reconciliation package even before last years presidential election. In March 2024, House Republicans huddled at their annual retreat, at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, to brainstorm what should be included in the bill so they'd be better prepared than in 2017.\n\nBut after Republicans took unified control of the White House and Congress in January, fissures in the party quickly began to emerge. Senate leaders pushed to carry out Trumps agenda in two separate bills, before the president endorsed the House approach of passing his agenda in one big, beautiful bill, which eventually became the title of the legislation.\n\nAlong the way, all 53 Senate Republicans voted to set a novel precedent by using a budget trick known as current policy baseline that treats $3.8 trillion in Trump tax cut extensions as costing $0, in order to avoid satisfying Senate rules requiring that they be paid for. Democrats said it was akin to the nuclear option will weaken the 60-vote threshold going forward.\n\nStill, Democrats did get a jab at Trump in the process: They deleted the title, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, by successfully arguing that the name wasnt budgetary in nature. The legislations official title is instead, An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14."

        "content": "As she heads out onto the rolling streets of Asheville, North Carolina, Brandi Hayes is moved by a memory of a father she barely knew.\n\nPart of the areas 5-year-old Post-Overdose Response Team (PORT), she races to emergency calls in a county-owned vehicle. With each rescue attempt, she is reminded of her own fathers death following a heroin overdose at age 27.\n\nMs. Hayes work, like PORTs efforts, doesnt stop at the 911 calls. The four-unit team follows up within 72 hours to provide support, education, counseling, and linkage to care. Given that Medicaid pays for most opioid treatment here, the governments low-income insurance program is intricately linked to PORTs mission.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Americans want to help combat drug addiction, within limits. Cuts to Medicaid, which supports many drug-treatment programs, could have community repercussions nationwide.\n\nMedicaid is a huge part of what we do, she says.\n\nNow, as Republicans move to limit Medicaid spending  hoping to rein in government and offset proposed tax cuts  opioid treatment efforts like those here in Asheville face an uncertain future. Its part of a broader controversy around the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, now nearing final approval in Congress. Even among Republicans, the Medicaid cuts are causing tension amid forecasts that millions of Americans could become uninsured.\n\nEligibility changes to Medicaid are coming at a tenuous moment for the opioid crisis, according to KFF, a nonprofit that provides nonpartisan reporting on national health policy. Nearly two-thirds of those with opioid addiction who are seeking treatment are on Medicaid, it says.\n\nSome 71 million Americans are currently enrolled in Medicaid, according to recent government data. The proposed changes could result in nearly 12 million more people being uninsured over the next decade. Spending cuts of up to $1 trillion, critics say, would be used to extend tax benefits to corporations and households earning over $200,000 per year.\n\nYou might wonder, if it is generally poor, white men who are dying of drug overdoses, why would this administration, which is built on the backs of lower-education white male voters, abandon something thats working? says David Herzberg, co-author of Whiteout: How Racial Capitalism Changed the Color of Opioids in America.\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP Three women and their baby daughters  Sandi Fox and Talia (left), Nathalie Demirdjian-Rivest and Helena (middle), and Allison Walker and Savannah (right)  gather with other MomsRising activists to oppose Medicaid cuts on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 25, 2025.\n\nThe opioid epidemic contributed to more than 100,000 overdose deaths in the United States in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with some 7 million Americans estimated to have some form of opioid use disorder, whether involving a prescription, fentanyl, or heroin.\n\nProgress in reducing overdose deaths\n\nBut last year, those overdose deaths dropped 27% nationwide and by a similar amount here in North Carolina, an encouraging sign to front-line workers like Ms. Hayes.\n\nAside from PORTs response and wraparound services, the decline, she says, is the result of myriad factors, including community saturation of the overdose-fighting drug naloxone, expansion of medication assisted treatment, the worsening quality of heavy street drugs thanks to interdiction efforts, and hesitancy by many to get involved in opioids given to the spike in overdose deaths that affected their communities.\n\nThe Trump administration has focused on an array of strategies, including securing borders where the drugs have been trafficked, promoting medical interventions, and disrupting the global pipeline of fentanyl, the opioid at the root of the overdose spike.\n\nWe will take action to continue to love and cherish the Medicare and Medicaid programs to ensure they are preserved for those who need them most, says a June 6 executive order signed by President Donald Trump that refers to older people as the primary Medicaid recipients it is focused on. (While older people are covered by Medicare, many also turn to Medicaid due to low incomes.)\n\nFor working-age adults, Senate and House versions of the bill include a requirement to work, volunteer, or study 80 hours a month to qualify for enrollment, unless they have an exception.\n\nThe bills rollback of eligibility exempts those with addiction disorders seeking treatment. But there are broad concerns about other eligibility and reporting requirements for those with drug problems, whether federal cuts will lead states to cut payments to treatment providers, and the impact of the cuts on rural hospitals, which have been the primary concern for holdout Republicans like Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina.\n\nPeople in conservative rural areas are often more likely to qualify for Medicaid. But getting help for drug addictions can often be difficult since some conservative states limit the kind of prescriptions that can be used for treatment, as well as what services are available.\n\nMedicaid is a big, if not the biggest, player, and a huge factor in how people with opioid abuse disorder get care, says Joshua Lynch, a professor of emergency and addiction medicine at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in New York. Reducing access to care following a year where deaths have been reduced is absolutely not the right answer. The opioid epidemic continues to evolve, and we need to evolve our response.\n\nLindsey Wasson/AP/File Rachel Cooper (right), who says she was introduced to fentanyl by her children, walks with Evelyn Jefferson, a Lummi Nation crisis outreach supervisor, at the edge of an encampment for homeless people near a Walmart store in Bellingham, Washington, Feb. 8, 2024.\n\nMuch the way crack cocaine impacted predominantly Black, urban neighborhoods in the 1990s, opioid dependence and overdoses bulldozed through rural America, mainly affecting young adult and middle-aged white men.\n\nBut in the past 15 years, overdose deaths among U.S. racial minorities, including from the use of opioids, have accelerated the fastest, with the mortality rate among Black Americans rising by 249% between 1999 and 2022.\n\nAn issue of public concern  with boundaries\n\nAlthough drug use has typically been considered a problem for poor, urban communities, Americans more generally have grown increasingly sympathetic toward opioid users seeking care. Three in 10 say they or a family member has experienced opioid addiction.\n\nAnd it is not just an issue for Democrats. More than half of Republicans (55%) oppose major cuts to the current Medicaid program. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, has called the proposed Medicaid rules morally wrong and politically suicidal, saying that the cuts would alienate working-class voters.\n\nBut there is a limit to that concern.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, an early Republican critic of the Medicaid reductions, told CNN recently that she changed her mind and was now supporting the cuts because they target people in the country illegally and people who refuse to meet work requirements.\n\nAttitudes about who should receive help can shift depending on historical patterns and whether favored groups are the ones suffering, says Professor Herzberg, a historian also at the University of Buffalo.\n\nPlaces like Asheville, a leafy, vibrant city that some locals see as an oasis for drug use, are among the testing grounds.\n\nStarting around 2010 through the COVID-19 pandemic, Asheville and the surrounding Buncombe County saw a surge in fentanyl-related overdose deaths, with about half of them being of people also experiencing homelessness. The other half came from all socioeconomic backgrounds. According to the North Carolina coroners office, those who died were restaurant workers, a dance instructor, a jeweler, and a Border Patrol agent.\n\nThat toll fueled a local response, which tapped into a culture of recovery in Asheville. Government institutions adopted harm reduction programs over punitive ones. The sheriff was elected in part on his plan to offer medication assisted treatment  which can cut overdose deaths by half  to incarcerated people. Underwriting many of these costs was, again, Medicaid.\n\nPatrik Jonsson/The Christian Science Monitor Yon Goldblatt, a recovering methamphetamine addict, talks about how Medicaid, the low-income government insurance program, was part of his journey to sobriety, in Asheville, North Carolina, on May 29, 2025.\n\nYon Goldblatt, a who is recovering from an addiction to methamphetamine and is homeless and living in Asheville, says Medicaid got him on the road to recovery.\n\nBut he understands how many Americans grow impatient with helping people who dont seem willing  or able  to help themselves. Its like saving someone from drowning and then watching them jump right back in the water, says the former massage therapist.\n\nProfessor Herzberg offers a different read. To him, an effective strategy is like pulling a drowning person to the surface and then releasing them only after theyve had the chance to take a breath.\n\nMedicaid cuts, he says, could jeopardize ready resources for addiction-affected places like Asheville to help them develop  and provide  harm reduction programs, fentanyl test strips, and other drug deterrents.\n\nWe have this continuum in the U.S. where harm reduction is really respected and in other places its not, says Professor Lynch, a former emergency medical technician. You can get people on a recovery pathway. Or you can say, Too bad. You get nothing.\n\nAs Ms. Hayes and her team gather in a grocery store parking lot, she hails a shirtless man and waves him over. His name is Shawn Vandernick, and he was her fathers best friend. Mr. Vandernick says that he has had an addiction to meth for a long time. But he credits Ms. Hayes PORT for helping him seek Medicaid-funded treatment.\n\nTheres no doubt, he says with a bright grin. Their efforts are paying off."

        "content": "An injured man is helped to leave the scene on Sunday after an explosion in downtown Tehran, amid Israels campaign of strikes against Iran.\n\nLast month, President Trump stood in the palatial ballroom of the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, and rebuked Americas misadventures in the Middle East.\n\nAs Saudi officials and U.S. business leaders looked on, Trump said that too many of his predecessors were afflicted with the notion that its our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins.\n\nIn the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built, he added. And the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA mere five weeks later, Trump appears to be on the cusp of his own Middle Eastern adventure, one with uncomfortable parallels to Americas invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nThat conflict  which killed at least 100,000 Iraqis and some 4,400 Americans, lasted almost nine years and destabilized the region for half a generation after. It became the prime example of the forever wars Trump railed against during his election campaign, and a lesson in the folly of intervening with no clear endgame.\n\nFor Trumps Persian Gulf and Arab allies, the prospect of a repeat performance has left them scrabbling for a diplomatic off-ramp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are no nations on the face of the Earth working harder than the Gulf countries today to calm the situation and stop this crazy war. They are absolutely against any military confrontation, said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist and commentator, adding that leaders of the United Arab Emirates have been burning the phones round the clock.\n\nIve never seen their diplomacy more active and more engaged than it is today to bring an end to this.\n\nMost Arab governments have little love lost on Iran, which they view as an unruly neighbor fomenting unrest in their own backyards. Its nuclear program has long been a concern, but the bigger fear has often been Irans allies in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, and their loyalties with a Shiite-majority Iran in a Sunni-dominated Arab world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the Biden administration, U.S. officials hoped to use that antipathy to forge an anti-Iran coalition that would see friendly nations like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE cooperating with Israel to isolate Tehran.\n\nInstead, rapprochement with Iran has been the modus operandi in recent years, with Gulf countries normalizing and easing tensions with the Islamic Republic under the calculation that regional stability would bring regional prosperity.\n\nAll were quick to condemn Israels attacks last week. Saudi Arabia, which for years engaged in proxy matches with Iran and was often seen as its main competitor for regional influence, denounced what it called blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nThe UAE said much the same. Despite being an enthusiastic member of the Abraham Accords, the Trump-brokered treaty that established relations between Israel and a raft of Arab nations, the UAE excoriated Israel for attacking Iran.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Emirati ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, called Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to express his solidarity; the same day, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed emphasized a diplomatic approach was needed to prevent the situation from spiraling into grave and far-reaching consequences.\n\nThat focus on diplomacy, observers say, reflects pragmatism: If the U.S. were to enter the conflict, its likely Iran  or one of its allied militias  would lash out at American personnel, bases and other interests in the region, including in the UAE.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are more than 40,000 U.S. soldiers and civilian contractors stationed in the Middle East, according to statements by Pentagon officials (though that number has fluctuated since Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023).\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations says the U.S. operates military facilities in 19 locations in countries such as Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the UAE. Eight of the facilities are considered permanent.\n\nPro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria have in the past regularly attacked U.S. bases. Last year, a drone launched by an Iranian-backed militia on a U.S. base in Jordan near the Syrian border killed three U.S. soldiers and injured 47 others.\n\nAlso, there is precedent for Irans allies attacking economic concerns, such as when the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen sent drones striking oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in 2019 and the UAE in 2022.\n\nIran may also decide to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital passageway that handles a fifth of the worlds energy flows. Meanwhile, Qatar shares ownership of the South Pars/North Dome field in Iran, the largest natural gas field in the world, which was hit last week in Israels strikes.\n\nA projectile hit buildings as Israels Iron Dome air defense system fires to intercept Iranian missiles over Tel Aviv, Israel, on June 13. (Leo Correa / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UAE and other Gulf countries absolutely do not want to be caught in the middle of a broader conflict nor do they want to be targeted by any party, as they have been in the past, said Elham Fakhro, a Gulf researcher at Harvards Belfer Center. She added governments also fear fallout from a strike against Irans nuclear facilities could contaminate natural resources they share with Iran.\n\nOthers, unsure how far the U.S. and Israel will go  whether they still stop at crippling Irans nuclear and missile programs or push for regime change  fear the impacts of the Iranian state disintegrating. Foremost in their minds are the aftereffects of Americas toppling of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, which unleashed sectarian rage, saw Iraq engulfed in blood-drenched bedlam and empowered terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.\n\nIts not in the interest of the Gulf states to see their large neighbor Iran collapse, wrote former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Jaber Al Thani in a post on X, adding that the region saw the consequences of what happened in Iraq. He urged Gulf decision-makers to immediately halt this madness initiated by Israel.\n\nThis war will also have profound repercussions for our region and perhaps the world, he wrote. Ultimately, the victor will not always be victorious and the vanquished will never be defeated.\n\nBehind that rhetoric is a growing conviction that Israel, rather than Iran, is the biggest threat to instability in the region, said Abdulla, the Emirati political scientist. Iran, after all, is diminished. In the past, it could rely on the so-called Axis of Resistance  a constellation of pro-Tehran militias and governments in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan  to frustrate adversaries plans. But the last 20 months of fighting have seen Israel cripple militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah while the U.S. has subdued Iraqi militias.\n\nIsrael, on the other hand, he said, continues its brutal military campaign in Gaza and is planning to annex the West Bank. It has also occupied areas in Syria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImperial Iran is probably no longer. OK, thats an opportunity. But imperial Israel is not necessarily good for the stability of the region either, Abdulla said.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials say Iran is not pursuing a nuclear bomb  contradicting Trump, who has said the opposite  and intelligence assessment experts quoted by CNN this week said Tehran was at least three years away from building a bomb and delivering it in a strike.\n\n(For all his complaints about American interventions in the Middle East  and claims that he had opposed the Iraq war two decades ago  when Trump was asked by radio personality Howard Stern in 2002 if he supported invading Iraq, he replied, Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.)\n\nIf the U.S. were to attack Iran now, it would likely supercharge efforts to bulk up the militaries not just in Iran but elsewhere in the region.\n\nThis week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said regional threats necessitated a ramping up of his nations medium- and long-range missiles, saying they were needed for deterrence.\n\nSoon, well reach a defense capacity that no one will dare challenge.  If youre not strong politically, socially, economically and militarily, you lack deterrence, and youre vulnerable, Erdogan said. We will elevate our level of deterrence so high that not only will they not attack us  they wont even dare to think about it."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trumps package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline.\n\nRepublicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks. Not all GOP lawmakers are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps, and and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion dollars in Trump tax breaks.\n\nThe 940-page bill was released shortly before midnight Friday. Senators were expected to take a procedural vote Saturday to begin debate on the legislation, but the timing was uncertain and there is a long path ahead, with at least 10 hours of debate time and an all-night voting session on countless amendments.\n\nSenate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House.\n\nIts evolving, said Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, as he prepared to close up the chamber late Friday.\n\nThe weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Mr. Trumps party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic policy plan. President Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up, even as he sometimes gives mixed signals, allowing for more time.\n\nAt recent events at the White House, including Friday, Mr. Trump has admonished the grandstanders among GOP holdouts to fall in line.\n\nWe can get it done, the president said in a social media post. It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country.\n\nThe legislation is an ambitious but complicated series of GOP priorities. At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Mr. Trumps first term that would otherwise expire by years end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit $350 billion to national security, including for Mr. Trumps mass deportation agenda.\n\nBut the spending cuts that Republicans are relying on to offset the lost tax revenues are causing dissent within the GOP ranks. Some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving health care through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives, worried about the nations debt, are pushing for steeper cuts.\n\nRepublican Sen. Thom Tillis said he is concerned about the fundamentals of the package and will not support the procedural motion to begin debate.\n\nIm voting no on the motion to proceed, he said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson, pushing for deeper cuts, said he needed to see the final legislative text.\n\nThe release of that draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the bill to ensure it complied with the chambers strict Byrd Rule, named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd. It largely bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 GOP edge and Democrats unified against Mr. Trumps bill.\n\nRepublicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals were determined to be out of compliance by the chief arbiter of the Senates rules. One plan would have shifted some food stamp costs from the federal government to the states; a second would have gutted the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nBut over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.\n\nThe final text includes a proposal for cuts to a Medicaid provider tax that had run into parliamentary objections and opposition from several senators worried about the fate of rural hospitals. The new version extends the start date for those cuts and establishes a $25 billion fund to aid rural hospitals and providers.\n\nMost states impose the provider tax as a way to boost federal Medicaid reimbursements. Some Republicans argue that is a scam and should be abolished.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that under the House-passed version of the bill, some 10.9 million more people would go without health care and at least 3 million fewer would qualify for food aid. The CBO has not yet publicly assessed the Senate draft, which proposes steeper reductions.\n\nTop income-earners would see about a $12,000 tax cut under the House bill, while the poorest Americans would face a $1,600 tax increase, the CBO said.\n\nOne unresolved issue remains the so-called SALT provision, a deduction for state and local taxes that has been a top priority of lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states. The cap is now $10,000.\n\nThe White House and House Republicans had narrowed in on a plan for a $40,000 cap, but for five years instead of 10. Republican senators says thats too generous. At least one House GOP holdout, Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, said he cannot support the compromise.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows whats in it.\n\nTheres no good reason for Republicans to chase a silly deadline, Mr. Schumer said.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who sent his colleagues home for the weekend with plans to be on call to return to Washington, said they are very close to finishing up.\n\nWe would still like to meet that July Fourth, self-imposed deadline, said Mr. Johnson.\n\nWith the narrow Republicans majorities in the House and Senate, leaders need almost every lawmaker on board to ensure passage. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thune have stayed close to the White House, relying on President Trump to pressure holdout lawmakers.\n\nThis story was reported by the Associated Press.\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Joey Cappelletti contributed to this report."

        "content": "President Donald Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House on Monday for the first time since the U.S. and Israel took military action against Iran last month in an effort to dismantle the countrys nuclear capabilities.\n\nThe two leaders complimented each other on their alliance in the conflict, with Netanyahu presenting Trump with a letter he said he sent to the Nobel Prize committee, in which he nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, a longtime ambition for the president. Israel would be the second country to nominate Trump for the award.\n\nTrump told reporters that Iran wants to talk with the U.S. and that Washington and Tehran have scheduled talks. He declined to reveal the timeline for those talks, telling reporters, Id rather not say, but youll be, youll be reading about it tomorrow.\n\nAsked whether regime change should take place in Tehran, Netanyahu said that is up to the people of Iran.\n\nWhile a ceasefire between Israel and Iran continues to hold after last month's 12-day conflict, a similar agreement in Gaza is proving harder to achieve, despite the optimistic tone struck by Trump and Netanyahu in recent days.\n\nTrump said Monday night that there was no \"hold-up\" in reaching a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. \"I think things are going along very well,\" he said.\n\nAsked about possibility of a two-state solution, Trump yielded the question to Netanyahu, who said Palestinians should have the powers to govern themselves but \"none of the powers to threaten us.\"\n\n\"That means that certain powers, like overall security will always remain in our hands. Now, that is a fact, and no one in Israel will agree to anything else, because we dont commit suicide,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nShortly before the White House meeting, Netanyahu met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and separately with Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Rubio and Witkoff joined Monday's dinner, along White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee.\n\nIsrael and Hamas appear deadlocked on whether a proposed agreement will lead to a permanent end to the fighting, which, barring a six-day pause in November 2023 and a 42-day ceasefire earlier this year, has raged for 21 months."

        "content": "The documentary 4.1 Miles opens to a bright, sunny day on the Aegean Sea. Its October 28, 2015, and for a moment the setting is beautiful: blue sky, blue water, horizon tilting in and out of view. Then you hear the screams. A gloved hand reaches out of frame and returns pulling a young boy to safety aboard a coast-guard boat. Then the captain spins around with a baby girl in his arms. Put the camera down, he says to the person behind the lens. Take this.\n\nJust over four miles from Turkey, the Greek island of Lesbos has been on the front lines of the global refugee crisis. Since January 2014, more than 1.5 million people have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, with many fleeing the Syrian civil war, the rise of ISIS, and oppressive regimes and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Upwards of 12,000 have died or gone missing along the way, but many of those whove survived the short but treacherous journey have landed on Lesbos, which received more than 500,000 migrants in 2015 alone.\n\nDaphne Matziarakis 20-minute Oscar-nominated film 4.1 Miles follows Greek Coast Guard Captain Kyriakos Papadopoulos as he and a small crew on Lesbos head out to sea again and again to pluck desperate men, women, and children from the swells. Before thousands of Syrians, Afghans, and Iraqis started setting out in boats in the hopes of finding refuge in Europe, Papadopoulos spent his days making routine patrols. But the film finds the captain thrust into the role of professional savior without any additional training or equipmentan average citizen trying to deal with a humanitarian disaster.\n\nOf the 10 films nominated for the 2017 Academy Awards in the documentary categories, four deal with the Syrian conflict or refugee crisis. Along with 4.1 Miles, the Netflix original The White Helmets and Watani: My Homeland are up for the short-form documentary Oscar, while the Italian film Fire at Sea was nominated for best feature documentary. The strength of these projects lies in the emotional, and often stark, portraits they paint of their characters. If audiences can imagine themselves in the shoes of Syrian rescue workers, a Greek coast-guard captain, an overwhelmed physician, or a migrant mother, these films may do more than enlighten or inform. Their creators all told me they hoped that, like other documentaries that have mobilized viewers and influenced lawmakers, their films can make far-away problems feel more immediately urgent.\n\nThe films nominations were announced just four days after President Donald Trumps inauguration and three days before he issued an executive order suspending refugee admissions from Syria indefinitely and from all other countries for 120 days. The order also temporarily halted arrivals from seven majority-Muslim nations and cut the total number of refugees that would be admitted to the U.S. in 2017 by more than half to 50,000. While the travel ban has since been suspended by federal courts, Trumps executive order set off protests at airports across the country and pushed the people and issues portrayed in these documentaries back into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen I made the film [in 2015], I thought it was very timely because it was when the refugee crisis was in the news, Matziaraki told me. I would never ever imagine that unfortunately the film would be so much more timely now in the U.S. While its unusual to have so many Oscar nominees address the same topic, The White Helmets producer Joanna Natasegara told me it makes sense in this case: Storytelling has always engaged with the most pressing issues of any given time, and documentary perhaps even more than narrative [film]. Those issues today, she said, are the refugee crisis and the war in Syria.\n\nAs a medium, documentaries offer an intimacy and focus often missing in daily news. Since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, the escalating violence and resulting flood of migrants have been covered by the international press, but in the face of constant coverage, its difficult for many readers to sustain the same level of attention day to day. It often takes a particularly horrifying imagea dead toddler washed up on a beach, a blank-faced 5-year-old covered in blood and dustto re-galvanize interest.\n\nMatziaraki, who grew up in Greece but is now based in the San Francisco Bay Area, said even she felt disconnected from the disaster playing out in her homeland. When she arrived on Lesbos, she found the situation was worse than shed imagined. I really wanted to make a film that would [bridge] this gap between our comfort zone and the reality of the world, she said.\n\nI asked them, Why go across the sea if you might die? They said, Its the word might that makes us go across the sea. The word might is hope.\n\nThe White Helmets director Orlando von Einsiedel also admitted to feeling numb to the tragedy. The film, made with Natasegara, tells the story of the Syrian Civil Defense, a group of volunteer rescue workers in the country who respond to attacks on civilians. When the filmmakers saw a YouTube video of the White Helmets pulling a newborn from a bombed-out building, they recognized a story missing from the mainstream representation of Syria. Theres a confusing, unbalanced picture of what is left behind for Syrian civilians on the ground, and a vacuum of any narrative about Syrians helping themselves or being active in their own saving, Natasegara told me. The idea of the Syrian hero was almost completely absent from the media landscape. The White Helmets were the perfect anecdote to that gap: They were former bakers, builders, tailors, and students whod banded together to save their fellow Syrians.\n\nThe other Syria-specific film, Watani: My Homeland follows the family of a rebel commander in Aleppo who has been kidnapped by ISIS. His wife, Hala, and their four children make the heartbreaking decision to flee the country and begin a new life in Germany. The director Marcel Mettelsiefen, a veteran photojournalist who covered the Arab Spring, said documentaries offer an emotional way into a story that can otherwise feel abstract. The importance of documentary filmmaking is to humanize the conflict, he told me.\n\nIn the feature category, Gianfranco Rosis Fire at Sea focuses on Lampedusa, an Italian island where hundreds of thousands of African refugees have landed since the 1990s. The filmmaker moved to Lampedusa for a year and a half to understand both the rhythms of daily life and the harrowing journey migrants endure to get there. The film is a cry of help to raise awareness, Rosi told me, recounting a conversation with one migrant. When I asked them, Why go across the sea if you might die? They said, Its the word might that makes us go across the sea. The word might is hope.\n\nWhile documentaries may have once been considered stale educational fare, their reputation as an exciting and mainstream art form has undoubtedly grown in recent years. Because of new distribution options and social media, documentaries now have the potential to reach a more global audience. By licensing The White Helmets to video-streaming giant Netflix, von Einsiedel and Natasegara made their film available in 190 countries (fellow documentary Oscar nominee 13th is also on Netflix). Matziarakis 4.1 Milesproduced while she was a graduate student in journalism at the University of California-Berkeleycan be viewed on the New York Times website, free to anyone with an internet connection. Fire at Sea has been released in 64 countries, including Japan, where it opened earlier this month. According to Reuters, the country accepted only 28 refugees in 2016, yet the 10 p.m. showing sold out in Tokyo on opening night.\n\nDocumentaries can often have clear, measurable consequenceswhether driving politicians to action or investing the general public in an issue that affects them. A 2015 study found that Gasland, the 2010 documentary on the dangers of fracking, led to greater discussion on social media and increased mass-media coverage, after its release and subsequent nomination for an Oscar in 2011. Sometimes films are credited with inspiring legislationas was the case with the 2012 Oscar-nominated film The Invisible War, which investigated sexual assault in the military, and the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which explored the treatment of orca whales at SeaWorld. Of course, some films have been criticized for misleading audiences by omitting inconvenient details or twisting statistics to make a more convincing argument or interesting story (as was the accusation leveled at the 2010 documentary Waiting for Superman, which portrayed charter schools as the prescription for an ailing public education system.)\n\nWhile its too soon to tell if this years Oscar-nominated documentaries have had a broader effect on peoples understanding of the migrant crisis or Syrian conflict, some of the filmmakers have already seen their work resonate on a smaller scale. Matziaraki said shes received letters from viewers asking how they can help or donate, including from one who traveled to Lesbos to volunteer after seeing 4.1 Miles. People that write to me and say, Thank you for changing my mind. Thank you for making me realize what is happening. This is really maybe the most important thing, Matziaraki said.\n\nIn the Fire at Sea director Rosis experience, the emotional connection fostered by these documentaries inevitably leads to a question: What can I do? Over the phone from New York, one of Rosis film subjects, Pietro Bartolo, offered one answer. As the physician on Lampedusa, Bartolo is often the first person to have real human contact with the refugees who arrive; hes also the man who performs autopsies on those who dont make it alive. He told me its important to simply show migrants they are welcome. People say, Can I come to Lampedusa to help? We dont need the help. We never asked for any help, he said. On Lampedusa, we are the door. That we leave it open, this is not enough. [When the refugees] arrive in Europe they need to feel that they are home."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Being a liberal justice on a Supreme Court with a six-Justice conservative super-majority can be a miserable job. The opportunities for victory are scant; frustration is the baseline. There are two different models for dealing with this reality, approaches that can broadly be described as strategic and rhetorical. A strategic Justice can try to lure a conservative vote here and there, to cobble together an elusive majority and at least limit the damage. A rhetorical Justice can call out the conservatives for the sake of educating the current public and planting a flag for history. Or sheand the three liberals are all womencan tailor her response to the specific case.\n\nElena Kagan exemplifies this last, hybrid model. She is more than willing to let the majority have it when that is warranted; she also forges compromises with individual conservatives when it is possible to pick up their votes. The newest member of the Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, is the epitome of the rhetorical Justice. Last week, as the Court prepared to finish its work for the year, Jackson issued a pair of dissents that signalled her despair over the Courts trajectory, her refusal to sugarcoat its behavior, and her willingness to break with her liberal colleagues, Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nNew Justices tend to hang back; Jackson, now in her third term, spoke up from the start. In her first eight oral arguments, she spoke eleven thousand words, twice as many as the next most loquacious Justice, Sotomayor. That tendency has persistedThe Hill found that Jackson spoke seventy-five thousand words this term, fifty per cent more than Sotomayorand it isnt the only measure of Jacksons assertiveness. As the Times Supreme Court correspondent Adam Liptak noted at the conclusion of Jacksons first term on the Court, Chief Justice John Roberts did not write his first solo dissent in an argued case until 16 years into his tenure. Justice Jackson issued three such dissents in her first term. Jacksons conduct this termin her work on the Court and her comments outside itis not different so much as it is more so: more alarmed at the direction the Court and the country are heading, and more willing than ever to go it alone in expressing that distress.\n\nJacksons independence from her liberal colleagues was on display in April, when the majority ruled that a challenge to President Trumps use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants to a Salvadoran prison had been brought in the wrong court. Sotomayors dissent, joined by Kagan, Jackson, and, in part, by the conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, was unsparing. She described the Trump Administrations effort to hustle the Venezuelans out of the country before they could obtain due process as an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. The Courts seeming indulgence of that behavior, she added, was indefensible. Jackson went further, in her own dissent. She assailed the majoritys fly-by-night approach of deciding cases on an emergency basis, without full briefing or oral argumentand compared the opinion with Korematsu v. United States, the discredited 1944 ruling upholding the internment of Japanese Americans. At least when the Court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong, Jackson wrote. With more and more of our most significant rulings taking place in the shadows of our emergency docket, todays Court leaves less and less of a trace. But make no mistake: We are just as wrong now as we have been in the past, with similarly devastating consequences. It just seems we are now less willing to face it.\n\nSpeaking last month at a judicial conference, Jackson seized the opportunity to call out the elephant in the room, which is the relentless attacks and disregard and disparagement that judges around the country, and perhaps many of you, are now facing on a daily basis. Two of her colleagues had already taken oblique aim at President Trump. In March, after Trump called for the impeachment of the district-court judge who handled the Alien Enemies Act case, the Chief Justice departed from his usual Olympian silence to note that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. Later that month, Sotomayor went a bit further. One of the things that is troubling so many right now is many of the standards being changed right now were norms that governed officials into what was right and wrong, Sotomayor cautioned in an appearance at Georgetown University Law Center. Once norms are broken, then you are shaking some of the foundation of the rule of law. Jackson, for her part, let it rip. Across the nation, judges are facing increased threats of not only physical violence but also professional retaliation, just for doing our jobs, she warned. And the attacks are not random; they seem designed to intimidate those of us who serve in this critical capacity. The attacks are also not isolated incidents; that is, they impact more than just the individual judges who are being targeted. Rather, the threats and the harassment are attacks on our democracyon our system of government. And they ultimately risk undermining our Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nThe ferocity of Jacksons dissents last week was remarkable in part because the opinions came in two relatively low-profile cases, not the kind of hot-button disputes that tend to bring out the adjectives. It was even more remarkable because, in both cases, one of her liberal colleagues was on the opposing side: Kagan, who tends to be more moderate than Jackson and Sotomayor, joined the majority. One case involved the important but technical question of whether the federal disability-rights law covers discrimination against retired workers in the benefits they receive. The majority opinion and the dissent each accused the other side of being driven by the desire to reach the outcome they wanted rather than by an interest in interpreting the law correctlya charge that is about as nasty as things get at the high court. Gorsuch, writing for the majority, asserted that Jackson had resorted to examining the purpose and legislative history of the disability law because she found the method of pure textualismlooking only at the precise language of a statuteinsufficiently pliable to secure the result she wanted. Jackson returned fire. Too often, this Court closes its eyes to context, enactment history, and the legislatures goals when assessing statutory meaning, she wrote. I cannot abide that narrow-minded approach. If a statutes text does not provide a clear answer to a question, it is not our role to keep twisting and turning those words until self-confirmatory observations solidify our first blush assumptions.\n\nSotomayor joined that part of Jacksons dissent, but she pointedly did not sign on to a lengthy footnote in which Jackson accused the majority of an unfortunate misunderstanding of the judicial role, arguing that the insistence on pure textualismits refusal to consider Congresss goals in enacting a statuteturns the interpretive task into a potent weapon for advancing judicial policy preferences. Far from being insufficiently pliable,  Jackson added, pure textualism is incessantly malleablethats its primary problemand, indeed, it is certainly somehow always flexible enough to secure the majoritys desired outcome.\n\nIf that exchange wasnt heated enough, in the second casewhich concerned whether gasoline companies, not just automakers, have standing to challenge Californias auto-emissions standardsJackson all but accused the majority of being in the pocket of big business. The Justices allowed the case to proceed even though the Trump Administration had signalled that it will repeal the waiver letting California set its own emissions standards. The Court does not explain why it is so eager to resolve this highly factbound, soon-to-be-moot dispute, Jackson wrote. For some, this silence will only harden their sense that the Court softens its certiorari standardshow it decides whether to hear a casewhen evaluating petitions from moneyed interests. She added, This Courts simultaneous aversion to hearing cases involving the potential vindication of the rights of less powerful litigantsworkers, criminal defendants, and the condemned, among otherswill further fortify that impression. Jackson made a similar point about the Courts finding: that gasoline companies had the right to sue. The majoritys demonstrated concern for ensuring that the fuel industrys ability to sue is recognized on these facts highlights a potential gap in the manner in which the Court treats the claims of plaintiffs pursuing profits versus those seeking to advance other objectives, she wrote. Sotomayor, notably, dissented separately."

        "content": "CNN \n\nAt some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report theyve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found.\n\nThis is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse, said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways, said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. This study is a major wake-up call.\n\nNonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found.\n\nStudents also overuse medications or use a pill that someone gave them due to a sense of stress around academics  they are trying to stay up late and study or finish papers, said pediatrician Dr. Deepa Camenga, associate director of pediatric programs at the Yale Program in Addiction Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nWe know this is happening in colleges. A major takeaway of the new study is that misuse and sharing of stimulant prescription medications is happening in middle and high schools, not just college, said Camenga, who was not involved with the study.\n\nWide range of abuse\n\nPublished Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.\n\nIn the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools.\n\nSchools with the highest rates of teens using prescribed ADHD medications were about 36% more likely to have students misusing prescription stimulants during the past year, the study found. Schools with few to no students currently using such treatments had much less of an issue, but it didnt disappear, McCabe said.\n\nWe know that the two biggest sources are leftover medications, perhaps from family members such as siblings, and asking peers, who may attend other schools, he said.\n\nSchools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study.\n\nSchools with more White students and those who had medium levels of student binge drinking were also more likely to see teen abuse of stimulants.\n\nOn an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis.\n\nIn addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found.\n\nBut these findings were not being driven solely by teens with ADHD misusing their medications, McCabe said. We still found a significant association, even when we excluded students who were never prescribed ADHD therapy.\n\nData collection for the study was through 2020. Since then, new statistics show prescriptions for stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most age groups. At the same time, there has been a nationwide shortage of Adderall, one of the most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patients unable to fill or refill their prescriptions.\n\nDangers of misuse\n\nThe stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say.\n\nIf overused or combined with alcohol or other drugs, there can be sudden health consequences. Side effects can include paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nResearch has also shown people who misuse ADHD medications are highly likely to have multiple substance use disorders.\n\nAbuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications  studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said.\n\nFor children with ADHD who use their medications appropriately, stimulants can be effective treatment. They are protective for the health of a child, Camenga said. Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well  they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.\n\nWhat parents and caregivers can do\n\nThe solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isnt to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed.\n\nParents should use a lockbox, count pills and stay on top of early prescription refills, experts say. Tassii/E+/Getty Images\n\nInstead, we need to look very long and hard at school strategies that are more or less effective in curbing stimulant medication misuse, he said. Parents can make sure the schools their kids attend have safe storage for medication and strict dispensing policies. And ask about prevalence of misuse  that data is available for every school.\n\nFamilies can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added.\n\nYoud be surprised how many kids do not know what to say, McCabe said. Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.\n\nParents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.\n\nFinally, if parents suspect any type of misuse, they should contact their childs prescriber right away, McCabe said. That child should be screened and assessed immediately."

        "content": "Zohran Mamdani, the young democratic-socialist state assemblyman who has waged a surprisingly strong campaign for mayor of New York City, hasnt just frustrated his opponents. Hes made them jealous. I regret not running for mayor in 2021, State Senator Jessica Ramos said this month, during a televised Democratic primary debate, when asked if she had any regrets in her political career. I thought I needed more experience, she explained. But turns out you just need to make good videos. Someone in the audience broke out in applause. It was obvious to everyone that this was a jab at Mamdani. Standing a few feet away from Ramos, Mamdani took in the dig withwhat else?a winning, dimpled smile.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nIn 2025, the idea of dismissing a political candidate for just being good at social media is almost a joke in itself. We have known for many years now that a candidate who can tell their story creatively on the internet is at an electoral advantage, in New York City and pretty much anywhere in the world. Social media is where many voters decide if a politician is what the Tammany Hall bosses a hundred years ago used to call regularwhether they can be counted on. Its an authenticity test. A mayoral campaign today that doesnt have a plan for good videosones in which the candidate can make their case and an implicit compact with their audienceis likely doomed. Its not difficult to understand Mamdanis opponents frustration. Most have spent years carefully plotting their mayoral runs, building their rsums, political connections, and fund-raising networks. Now the kid with the nice eyebrows is running circles around them.\n\nWhen I had coffee with Mamdani a few months ago, he proudly told me that his thousands of campaign volunteersthe people hed converted to his side, partly with good videoswould, before primary day, knock on a million doors on his behalf. I was skeptical. Which million, I asked. Mamdani flashed me another one of those damned smiles. At the time, I had been thinking of recent debates over the effectiveness of political canvassing and other ground-game techniques. I was reminded particularly of the former congressman Beto ORourke, who excited his supporters around the country with a pledge to knock on more than a million doors in Texas in his run for Senate, in 2018, only to come up short against Ted Cruz. Texas is bigtwo hundred and sixty-nine thousand square milesand has resisted canvassing efforts for decades. But New York Citys four hundred and sixty-nine square miles might present an even harder challenge to door knocking: Who in this town answers the door to a stranger with an open mind? Who even opens the door?\n\nWhat I hadnt considered is that, even if knocking on a million doors isnt the most efficient use of campaign resources in New York City, it makes for great content. The story of Mamdanis door-knocking campaign and other old-fashioned efforts reached millions of people online, gave the campaign shape, and helped it become a movement. Ding-dong and TikTok. In politics today, one can feed off the other.\n\nMamdani has a movement behind him, but he has spent the closing days of the primary race struggling to build a coalition. Even in the polls that look best for him, Mamdani comes up short to Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor who has led every ranked-choice poll since he entered the race. In one poll, conducted on behalf of a super PAC that supports Mamdani (in 2025, even socialists have super PACs), he comes out just two points behind Cuomo in the final round of ranked-choice voting. The cross tabs of that poll showed why. Among Black voters, Mamdani lost by more than forty points. Among Hispanic voters, he lost by nearly ten. Mamdanis voters trended younger than Cuomosno big surprise therebut also whiter, better educated, and more male. That he has aspired to speak for the citys downtrodden but has done best drawing out the work-from-home creative class is a contradiction that he wasnt able to resolve before primary day.\n\nThat same poll showed Mamdani leading among Asian voters. There are 1.5 million residents of Asian descent in the city, but thats still less than twenty per cent of the citys population. Mamdani, the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan Indian political scientist, and Mira Nair, an Indian American filmmaker, has also made a representation pitch to the citys more than seven hundred thousand Muslims. But forming a coalition requires reaching voters beyond what might be considered a politicians natural base, stitching together unlikely factions, communities, and blocs. In the races closing days, Mamdanis campaign became fixated on momentum, reaching for the figurative in lieu of the numerical. (E-mail subject line, June 17th: AS MOMENTUM REACHES A FEVER PITCH, BERNIE SANDERS ENDORSES ZOHRAN MAMDANI FOR MAYOR.) When the votes get counted, though, coalitions trump momentum every time.\n\nMamdani has been stymied for several reasons that were apparent before primary day. For one thing, he is undeniably young, and he never found a way to reassure voters that he was truly up for the job of managing the citys agencies, its hundred-billion-dollar budget, and its three-hundred-thousand-person workforce. In trying to become the youngest mayor since John Purroy Mitchelthe idealistic Boy Mayor who was elected at thirty-four, in 1914, and got crushed by Tammanys man John Francis (Red Mike) Hylan three years laterMamdani never explained how he might avoid Mitchels fate. The new program of public spending he has proposed is predicated on increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations, taxes that would have to be approved in Albany. If the big shots in Albanynever a good bet for anything, politicallyrefuse him, what would become of Mayor Mamdani? No one can say.\n\nSome voters are turned off by the socialist label, though most of Mamdanis policies are hardly revolutionary. Hes calling for free buses (they have some free bus lines in Boston) and freezing the rent on rent-regulated apartments (which Bill de Blasio did three times in his eight years as mayorand rents still kept rising in the city over all). Mamdani has backed off some of the language that hed espoused during his activist days in college and the years afterI will not defund the police, he said, at the final Democratic primary debatebut he has not fully explained what changed his mind, besides the fact that he is running for mayor.\n\nMamdanis critics and opponents have cornered him for his views on Israela line of questioning that his supporters say is unfair. Theyre right that outlets like the New York Post and the Free Press have tried to make him a bogeyman, and that attack ads funded by Cuomo and his allies have relied on Islamophobic tropes and racism. (Less Safe. Too Radical, read one mailer that arrived in my mailbox, next to what must be one of the only unflattering photographs of Mamdani in existence.) But part of the reason that reporters have kept asking Mamdani about Israel is because his answer isnt very convincing. I believe Israel has the right to exist as a state with equal rights, he says. For a guy who exudes authenticity, that sounds suspiciously like a line he arrived at not personally but after a series of increasingly frustrating meetings. There are nearly a million Jews living in New York City, many of them ardently Zionist, and the next mayor is going to have to speak on this issue. (Think of the protests at Columbia, and of the ongoing federal response to them.) This was a challenge for Mamdani, and not one he has yet met.\n\nIn the primary campaigns closing days, Mamdani has shown signs of casting about for ways to winhes shown signs, in other words, of being a normal politician. Hes reached for the strains of liberalism and radicalism that have expressed themselves in the city in recent years, sometimes reaching for more than one at once. Government must deliver an agenda of abundance that puts the ninety-nine per cent over the one per cent, he told a huge rally crowd at the Manhattan music venue Terminal 5, serving up Occupy-tinged red meat with a side of centrist-slogan salad. He made a surprising overture to the citys Orthodox Jewish communities, which were stung a few years ago by a Times investigation that revealed neglect and academic underperformance in Hasidic yeshivas. The issue of your education is something I will listen to your leaders [about], Mamdani told a Hasidic newspaper a few weeks ago. Were these the shrewd moves of a wunderkind on the doorstep of a historic election upset? Or were they compromises made by a precocious political talent seeing the numbers close in around him?\n\nNo one has ever accused Andrew Cuomo of being regular. For more than a decade, he has loomed over New York politics like the Prince of Darkness. The son of a legendary former New York governor, Mario Cuomo, he is the closest thing in living memory that the state has to political royalty. Cuomo, who legalized same-sex marriage in New York and spearheaded major infrastructure projects such as the bridge across the Hudson River named for his father, is among the handful of paternalistic local leaders in historylike Peter Stuyvesant, who told the residents of New Amsterdam that he would rule over them like a father, Nelson Rockefeller, and Michael Bloombergwhose legacies, good and bad, will endure for centuries.\n\nThe question is: what is he doing running for mayor? Four years out from a sexual-harassment and abuse-of-power scandal that forced him from office as governor, Cuomo is clearly running to redeem himself, if only in his own eyes. He has plodded through the race, parking his Dodge Charger wherever he pleases and apologizing for nothing and no one, making no promises to avoid the bullying, recalcitrance, handsiness, and tolerance of corruption that he was known for in the governors office. In fact, hes avoided promises of any kind about what hed do as mayor. Instead of focussing on policy pledges, Cuomo has made the campaign a demonstration of political might, garnering endorsements from elected officialsincluding many who called for him to resign four years agofrom labor union leaders (though DC 37, which represents most city workers, backed Mamdani over him), and from religious leaders in Black and Jewish communities. The power plays have at times been breathtaking. In June, a group of Orthodox leaders in South Brooklyn announced their support for Adrienne Adams, the speaker of the City Council. A few days later, they announced that they had changed their minds and had decided to back Cuomo instead.\n\nCuomo doesnt make good videos, but he knows that he doesnt need to. Say what you will about the cynical old operator, he has spent the campaign stitching together a coalition. In 2013, Bill de Blasio won the mayoral election with a potent mix of Black votes plus liberals of various creeds and colors. In 2021, Eric Adams succeeded de Blasio with a potent mix of Black votes plus moderates of various creeds and colors. Cuomo is now attempting to re-create Adamss formula. Sunday after Sunday, he has sat in the pews at Black churches. He has called the rise in antisemitism the most important issue in the election, and, though this is transparent pandering (most voters say affordability and public safety are top of mind for them), it has not blunted its political effectiveness. When Mamdani has wobbled on provocative slogans like Globalize the intifada, he has played right into Cuomos hands. The former governors chances of being a disaster as mayor are at least as high as Mamdanis, but many rich and powerful New Yorkers appear willing to ignore that risk. (Bloomberg contributed more than eight million dollars to a super PAC backing Cuomo.) He simply might have the votes.\n\nSince Mamdani gained on Cuomo in the last weeks of the spring, the Democratic primary has mostly looked like a two-man contest. But there was a moment last week when everyone was talking about Brad Lander, the citys comptroller, who has spent much of the race polling at a distant third place. Within a matter of days, Lander was sort of endorsed by the Times and got himself detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers while trying to escort a man out of immigration court. Im going to be just fine, Lander told reporters after his release. I lost a button. The real issue, he said, was what happened to the man he was trying to help, who was now trapped somewhere in the countrys immigration-detention gulag. It was a good performance from a veteran of local government who hopes to lead a city of immigrants through a period of anti-immigrant terror. And, though the sight of masked plainclothes officers manhandling the citys second-highest-ranking elected official was a terrifying omen for Trumps encroachment on New York, it also made, not incidentally, for good videos.\n\nLander is a candidate who might have once hoped for an endorsement from the Times editorial board, and who was dismayed last year when the paper announced it would stop endorsing in local races. Everyone remembers the primary in 2021, when a Times endorsement helped propel Kathryn Garcia, the camera-shy former sanitation commissioner, within a few thousand votes of the front-runner, Eric Adams. This month, the papers opinion section relented in its determination to stay out of the mayoral race, sort of, and released a survey of fifteen notable New Yorkers, seven of whom picked Lander as their first-choice candidate. (No other candidates received the support of more than two respondents.)\n\nThen, a few days later, the paper published an unsigned editorial that admonished New Yorkers not to vote for Mamdani; described Lander as competent but uninspiring; and reluctantly supported Cuomo, despite serious objections to his ethics and conduct. The piece was bizarre. It glossed de Blasios eight years as mayor as the source of the citys current decline, while making almost no mention of the pandemics devastation, the shoddy scandals of the Adams administration, or the hostility that the current President displays for the politics and people of his home town. But in its weird, jumpy antagonism, the editorial captured a mix of sentiments that a certain swath of New Yorkers, particularly the wealthy and the powerful, do feel: that the city is less nice and less safe than it was not so long ago, that theyd rather go with a disgraced establishment politician like Cuomo than risk it with more progressive alternatives, and that the thirty-three-year-old socialist upstart with the good videos is a joke. The punch line is hes still making them nervous. "

        "content": "DHAKA, Bangladesh  A special tribunal has sentenced Bangladeshs former leader Sheikh Hasina to six months in jail after she was found in contempt of court for allegedly claiming she had a license to kill at least 227 people.\n\nWednesdays sentence was the first in any case against Hasina since she fled to India during a mass uprising last year that toppled her 15-year rule.\n\nThe contempt case stemmed from a leaked audio recording of a supposed phone conversation between Hasina and a leader of the student wing of her political party. A person alleged to be Hasina is heard on the audio saying: There are 227 cases against me, so I now have a license to kill 227 people.\n\nThe Criminal Investigation Department confirmed the audios authenticity through forensic analysis.\n\nThe recording showed Hasinas anger at the charges of murder and numerous other crimes against her under the interim administration of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, who vowed to punish Hasina and her top aides for the deaths of hundreds of people in the uprising against her.\n\nSheikh Hasina in Doha, Qatar in 2023. Christopher Pike / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe sentencing by the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal came as a trial against her being held in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity began in June.\n\nThe tribunal had ordered Hasina and her former home minister to respond by May 15. When they failed to do so, the tribunal summoned them May 25 to appear in court June 16. Later the tribunal asked for notices to be published in newspapers asking Hasina to appear.\n\nThe prosecution said later neither of the suspects appeared before the court or explained their absence through a lawyer. In such circumstances, the tribunal has the authority to issue a sentence under the law.\n\nHasina and her Awami League party had earlier criticized the tribunal and its prosecution team for their connection with political parties, especially with the Jamaat-e-Islami party.\n\nThe Yunus-led government has banned the former ruling Awami League party and amended laws to allow for the party to be prosecuted for its role during the uprising.\n\nIn February, the U.N. human rights office estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks in the crackdown on the student-led protests against Hasina, who was the countrys longest serving prime minister.\n\nThe tribunal was established by Hasina in 2009 to investigate and try crimes involving Bangladeshs independence war in 1971. The tribunal under Hasina tried politicians, mostly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, for their actions during the nine-month war against Pakistan. Aided by India, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasinas father and the countrys first leader."

        "content": "To reach a landmark agreement in 2015 limiting Irans nuclear program, President Barack Obama accepted two years of tough negotiations with Tehran as the diplomatic price to pay to seal a deal.\n\nNot so Donald Trump.\n\nWhen Iranian negotiators balked this month at the maximal terms President Trump demanded of Tehran to guarantee its nuclear program would never deliver a bomb  and especially after Israel unilaterally began an air war on Iran  an impatient president dispatched the military.\n\nWhy We Wrote This In his second term, and in particular over the past two weeks, President Donald Trump has unleashed on friend and foe alike a diplomatic style that jettisons all the norms of traditional diplomacy in favor of commands, threats, and shows of force.\n\nSaying he was acting in the interest of peace and heading off a broader war in the Middle East, Mr. Trump sent bombers to attack three Iranian nuclear sites, including the Fordow facilities located deep inside a mountain.\n\nIt was diplomacy by 30,000-pound bunker-buster bomb.\n\nIn his second term, and in particular over the past two weeks, President Trump has unleashed a diplomatic style that jettisons all the norms of traditional diplomacy  dialogue, bargaining, trust-building, and patience  in favor of commands, threats, and shows of force.\n\nAnd much of the policymaking and announcing is carried out on the one-way street of social media.\n\nIts diplomacy by tweet and by fiat, says Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow in international affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.\n\nIts also a style that aims to keep friend and foe alike guessing, and our closest allies, like those in Europe, off balance, Dr. Kupchan says.\n\nShifting tune on NATO\n\nThat approach was on display at the NATO summit at The Hague Wednesday.\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters on Air Force One Tuesday, the president cast some doubt on the U.S. commitment to the alliances mutual-defense principle, enshrined in the NATO charters Article 5. Depends on your definition; there are numerous definitions of Article 5, Mr. Trump said.\n\nBut in a press conference at the end of the summit Wednesday, the mercurial president said he had a new appreciation for NATO.\n\nHe said he came here because I had to, but is leaving feeling differently. Its not a rip-off, and were here to help them protect their countries.\n\nKin Cheung/Reuters U.S. President Donald Trump (center), British Prime Minister Keir Starmer (at left), and NATO General-Secretary Mark Rutte attend a North Atlantic Council plenary meeting during the NATO summit at The Hague, Netherlands, June 25, 2025.\n\nIts a diplomatic style unique in American history, Dr. Kupchan says, but one that reflects Mr. Trumps background as an authoritarian businessman used to getting his way.\n\nHes used to making decisions and telling the people around him what to do and they do it, he says.\n\nIn his first term Mr. Trump was restrained by some seasoned advisers and Cabinet members who controlled his whims, Dr. Kupchan says. But in his second term, the president has been set free to apply his management style to diplomacy and world affairs.\n\nThis week the war simmering between Iran and Israel was the setting for Trump diplomacy 2.0  and it garnered mixed results.\n\nMonday evening the president announced a ceasefire on his social media channel, surprising even some of his closest aides. Israel and Iran had both agreed to a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE, he declared on his social media channel  even though neither of the belligerents had announced any such agreement.\n\nRage on the South Lawn\n\nBut by Tuesday morning, when the ceasefire was showing signs of unraveling, an impatient president exploded in rage at both Iran and Israel.\n\nAs he departed for the NATO summit, he confirmed to journalists assembled on the White House South Lawn that Iran had broken the ceasefire he had declared, adding, But Israel violated it, too.\n\nBaring his displeasure, he then added, We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they dont know what the [expletive] they are doing. It was hardly traditional diplomatic speak.\n\nWithin a few hours, both Israel and Iran announced their adherence to the ceasefire. And again Mr. Trump gathered journalists for an announcement, this time aboard Air Force One.\n\nNow were going to NATO, and well get a new set of problems, Mr. Trump said. Well solve a new set of problems.\n\nBut whether the presidents fast-paced and unvarnished diplomatic approach is truly solving problems remains to be seen, some foreign policy experts say.\n\nTrump wants quick deals and fast results, and he wants to shout these deals in capital letters on social media, says Julianne Smith, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and president of Clarion Strategies, a Washington consulting firm. But the truth of the matter is that diplomacy requires patience, building relationships, and a two-way street, she adds, so well see if Trumps very different approach delivers lasting results.\n\nRemko de Waal/Reuters U.S. President Donald Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni attend a dinner with NATO heads of state and government at the Paleis Huis ten Bosch ahead of the summit at The Hague, Netherlands, June 24, 2025.\n\nAnother hallmark of the presidents diplomatic approach is his frequent referencing of American power and its unilateral application, Ambassador Smith says. His preference is a language of power and strength, and he believes we are in an era of the great powers asserting their spheres of influence.\n\nNoting Mr. Trumps attendance at the summit, she adds, In reality he has little use for the kind of multilateralism that the U.N., the European Union, or even NATO represent.\n\nHard power is back in vogue\n\nOne question analysts debate is whether the diplomacy Mr. Trump is pursuing is a blip closely tied to his personality, or if global trends will make it, at least to some degree, the new norm.\n\nDonald Trump is sui generis; hes a reality TV star who makes everything about him 24/7, Dr. Kupchan says. But on the other hand, he says, there are forces at work that are influencing President Trump and will influence the course of presidencies to come.\n\nOne factor is that hard power is back in vogue, and it doesnt matter if its Trump or Biden or Obama in the Oval Office, he says. Thats a change that is not going to go away.\n\nAnother factor at work is a waning of the deep multilateralism that took hold  and for which the United States was the chief architect  after World War II, he says.\n\nTrumps instincts in many respects are more in tune with the world of the 19th century  think protectionism with a dash of gunboat diplomacy  that they resonate more with 19th-century grand strategy than with post-Pearl Harbor grand strategy, Dr. Kupchan says. The problem is that the fortress America vision and inward focus of the 19th-century world are not possible today.\n\nThus Mr. Trump found himself at the summit of one of the multilateral institutions of the last century  if for barely 24 hours.\n\nTo accommodate an impatient U.S. president, NATO summit planners made sure the event would be short and sweet  and as devoid of opportunities for spoilers as possible.\n\nThere were even signs that other world leaders are not only adapting to Mr. Trumps diplomatic style, but adopting it.\n\nDeepen your worldview\n\nwith Monitor Highlights.

Europe is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it will be your win."

        "content": "The retail industry is breathing a sigh of relief after it appeared to avoid the worst case scenario on Vietnam tariffs.\n\nBut some executives believe the tentative trade deal President Donald Trump announced Wednesday is still bad for business and could have a chilling effect on consumer spending.\n\nIts a lot better news than where we were on Liberation Day, one CEO of a popular consumer brand told CNBC after Trump said tariffs on Vietnamese imports would be 20%, down from the 46% levy he proposed on April 2, then later suspended. The new rate would be double the 10% duty currently in place.\n\nAnother executive called the news bad but agreed that a 20% tariff was better than the 46% duty Trump originally imposed, however unrealistic the proposed rate was.\n\nI guess Trump needs positive news, a third executive said. I think things are going to evolve. Lets see if this is definitive.\n\nTrumps announcement on Wednesday came only days before the 90-day suspension of the steep tariffs he proposed in April expires next week, and as his administration scrambles to strike agreements with dozens of trading partners. Even so, he did not say when the deal with Vietnam would take effect, or whether both sides have agreed to the tariff rates.\n\nIn the months between Trumps April 2 tariff rollout and his announcement on Wednesday, retail executives in the apparel and footwear industries fretted over the potential that Vietnam imports could face tariffs nearly as high as the cumulative 55% duties for Chinese imports.\n\nOver the last decade, some of Americas top retailers, including Gap, American Eagle and Nike, have all reduced their reliance on China to shield themselves from both high tariffs and the regions geopolitical turbulence.\n\nMany sought refuge in Vietnam, where the factories, some owned by Chinese businesses, are known to produce products at a similar quality and price as China. They also started manufacturing in other countries in southeast Asia, such as Cambodia, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Cambodia was facing tariffs of 49%, Bangladesh 37% and Malaysia 24% under Trumps April plan, but are subject to a 10% duty for now.\n\nVietnam is now the second-largest supplier of footwear, apparel and accessories sold into the U.S. market, according to the industry trade group the American Apparel & Footwear Association. It has become an essential part of the footwear supply chain, on pace to become the largest supplier of shoes to the U.S. in 2025, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, another industry trade group.\n\nIf Trumps proposed 46% tariff on Vietnam had taken effect, it would mean much of the industrys work to leave China would have been for naught. Some companies are relieved the tentative deal would set the levy at 20% and the announcement agreement is also a sign that Cambodia, Malaysia and Bangladesh could reach similar frameworks.\n\nTwenty percent is a sigh of relief, said Sonia Lapinsky, a partner and managing director at AlixPartners who advises fashion brands. Theres some positivity and some optimism that this is manageable. So at least theres that. This isnt business destroying, which is great. However, this does have real implications, right?\n\nMost companies have plenty of tools to offset the impact of tariffs, such as working with their suppliers to share costs. But to avoid major hits to their profit margins, many including Nike are planning to raise prices. Its still unclear how those hikes will affect consumer spending because it will take time for the increases to trickle down in the supply chain.\n\nAlixPartners previously created pricing models for CNBC that examined how the price of Vietnamese-made sweaters and shoes could rise under Trumps proposed tariffs  if retailers do not pass any of the cost on to suppliers or shoppers. At a 10% levy, the cost of a $95 pair of mens shoes could rise by $7.42 to $102.42. With a 20% duty in place, the cost increase would be even larger.\n\nMany executives worry any tariff hike of this magnitude will be bad for businesses and consumers. Paul Cosaro, the CEO of Picnic Time, a supplier to top retailers like Target, Kohls and Macys, said if the clocks were wound back to April and Trump said thered be a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, no one wouldve been happy.\n\nThere could be threats of a 46% tariff and you come back with 20 and its going to sound better but its just more money coming out of the consumers pockets at the end of the day and they have less money to spend on picnic baskets and coolers and things like that, said Cosaro, who raised his prices between 11% and 14% earlier this year to offset the cost of China tariffs.\n\nIts not good for the consumer. Ultimately, its just increasing the prices  I dont think thats good news."

        "content": "Seeing America from abroad\n\nDigital nomads from the U.S. who roam the world say their time abroad allows them to recognize  and even appreciate  aspects of American life and the privilege of American identity.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nSome things become clearer with some distance - like home. The farther you travel from your native country, the clearer you may be able to see it. And over the years, more Americans have left the U.S. to roam the world as digital workers. NPR's Frank Langfitt recently spoke with some of them, and they said they only gained insights into certain aspects of American culture and identity after they left the U.S.\n\nFRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Michael Jensen has spent the last eight years traveling and living with his husband in 30 different countries. Jensen credits his wanderlust to America's pioneering spirit and the encouragement to explore the world.\n\nMICHAEL JENSEN: I've had the freedom as an American to reinvent myself over and over. There was no societal norm holding me in place.\n\nLANGFITT: Drive and hard work fueled the American dream. Jensen says many Americans want to stand out, but he found that some people in some other countries don't. He came across the following concept in Australia.\n\nJENSEN: There's something called the tall poppy syndrome. The idea of that is, you do not want to be taller than everybody else, and if you do, they're going to cut you down. Americans, if you talked about the tall poppy syndrome, they'd be like, what the hell? I mean, that's ridiculous. Of course, you want to be the tallest poppy you can possibly be, and that's celebrated.\n\nLANGFITT: Jensen thinks many characteristics of American life cut both ways. The United States' $30 trillion economy creates tremendous consumer choice. Jensen compares a grocery store in England - where he was living when we spoke - with a Fred Meyer superstore in Seattle.\n\nJENSEN: Here you go to the grocery store, and, you know, there's a healthy selection of chips. But when I look at the chip aisle in a Fred Meyer, it's 30, 40 feet long of every different combination of chip. You know, on one hand, sure, it's great. You can have every kind of chip you want. On the other hand, it feels absurd and overwhelming.\n\nLANGFITT: Michael Kohler is a screenwriter who's lived in more than 16 countries over the past nine years. One thing his travels have taught him is that Americans are comparatively very chatty.\n\nMICHAEL KOEHLER: People from different countries have definitely pointed out that apparently, I talk a lot, which is hilarious because I think by American standards, I'm fairly introverted.\n\nLANGFITT: Koehler recalled watching a sunset from a balcony in Poland with a woman he was interested in.\n\nKOEHLER: And I was, like, man, just look at that sunset. Oh, you see those birds? And she goes, Michael, yes, I see the sunset. I see the birds. Can we just not mention the sunset and the birds because I have my pair of eyes as well?\n\nLANGFITT: In coworking spaces, Koehler noticed Americans were often the last to leave, reinforcing a reputation for industry rooted in the Protestant work ethic - a reputation that some in Europe also make fun of. Koehler cites a meme about out-of-office messages a couple of years ago.\n\nKOEHLER: The European out-of-the-office - I'll be on vacation for the next five weeks. If you email me, I'll get back to you after that. The American out-of-office - hey, so I'm going in for kidney surgery. I probably am going to have to duck out around, like, 4 p.m., but I'll be back up and running at, like, 5:30.\n\nSTEPHANIE PERRY: My name is Stephanie Perry, and I see the world as a house sitter.\n\nLANGFITT: Perry began roaming the world full-time in 2018. She supports her travel by looking after other people's homes. Perry also happens to be Black. She says she found that when she's overseas, people see her as American first and that she's less likely to encounter racism.\n\nPERRY: When I'm out of the United States, I never have to prepare for someone to mistreat me. Some of that is that people automatically know I'm American and I...\n\nLANGFITT: And is it because of how you dress, the way you hold yourself?\n\nPERRY: Definitely the Old Navy clothes. It's probably the way I smile. I'm smiling at people and saying good morning to people, right? Very American, and that comes with privileges. And there are a lot of places where the American privilege will far outweigh whatever anti-Blackness they might experience.\n\nLANGFITT: Perry is easy to peg as an American. She has a relaxed confidence and warm personality. Perry recalls sitting on a barrier at a mall in Malaysia, waiting to watch a water show.\n\nPERRY: The security guard came by and made everyone move off of a barrier, and he let me just sit there, right (laughter)? He was just like, she don't know. Let the American do what she wants to do.\n\nLANGFITT: Perry runs a business that helps fellow Black women plan lives abroad. She feels more comfortable overseas and says she has no plans to return to the U.S. to live anytime soon. Frank Langfitt, NPR News.\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "content": "An Alabama food bank braces for big increase in demand if SNAP cuts take effect\n\ntoggle caption Alina Selyukh/NPR\n\nAn Alabama food bank leader anticipates a major increase in people needing to turn to groups like hers to cover their basic needs if the massive tax and spending legislation backed by President Trump clears Congress.\n\nLinda Jones, the co-founder of the food bank Alabama Childhood Food Solutions, says her program that now distributes food to nearly 2,600 kids each week has already seen a 30% increase over last year. Overall, her organization now feeds close to 1,200 families in central Alabama  doubling last year's numbers.\n\n\"It's just growing by leaps and bounds. And if this new bill gets passed, which I feel like it probably will, we will probably start doubling even more so,\" Jones told NPR's Michel Martin.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSpeaking on Morning Edition, Jones said high food prices are driving the increase. \"We've had people come in and said that they got food stamps, but they don't give them anything but bread and milk. And by the time they get out of the grocery store, that's it. So that's where they come to us to get other food,\" she added.\n\nThe bill would make major changes to the country's social safety net. Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are targeted for major cuts. Millions of people stand to lose food assistance if the House passes the bill after it cleared the Senate earlier this week, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of the House's first version of the bill.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMichel Martin: Why do you think it's gone up so much?\n\nLinda Jones: I think it's because of the food prices. Like eggs, $8 a dozen. Who can afford that? And milk is so high. Everything is so high. We've had people come in and say that they got food stamps even, but that doesn't give them anything but bread and milk. And by the time they get out of the grocery store, that's it. So that's where they come to us, to get other food.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMartin: One of the things that this bill would do, especially with Medicaid and SNAP, it would now be linked to work requirements.\n\nJones: Yes. And I don't know how that's going to work because some of the people agree on it. Some of them could work. And I agree with that. Those that are capable of working should work. But some of them, you look at them and you think, man, they could go out and go to work. But once you start talking to them, it's a different story entirely.\n\nMartin: It's my understanding that a lot of people who get Medicaid and/or food stamps already work. Is that true?\n\nJones: Yes, I think so.\n\nMartin: So tell me more about that. If they were already working, what's the story? Why do they need this food help?\n\nJones: Some come in and get food. And they say they're like a dollar or two [off] to qualify for food stamps, or they've lost their food stamps because they moved.\n\nWe had some children in our backpack ministry where this young boy was getting food every week. He came in and asked the teacher if he could possibly get his bag early because they had no food in the house whatsoever. So, come to find out, there was a dad that had seven children whose wife took the youngest child and left him abandoned with the other children. And this man and his family were just hanging on by a thread. But we came in and we're giving them food now monthly to help him with his grocery bill, at least.\n\nMartin: And the backpack ministry, remind us what that is.\n\nJones: The backpack ministries is where we feed children that don't get enough food during the week at school and we give them food for the weekends.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMartin: Do you see waste, fraud and abuse in the system from where you are?\n\nJones: From my standpoint, no. Mostly what we see are poor, poor people. We try to make every dollar we can count to be able to buy that food. We have an audit every year. And this year, they came in and they said that 97% is what we use for all our food and stuff. Only 3% is used for other things.\n\nMartin: So it's only like 3% administrative costs, which is a very narrow margin. So I guess you're operating mostly on volunteers, right?\n\nJones: Yes, we have over 900 volunteers come in through our distribution center once a year.\n\nThe digital and broadcast versions of this story were edited by Olivia Hampton."

        "content": "President Trumps directive banning negative messaging about U.S. history at national parks includes Manzanar National Historic Site, where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.\n\nIn his ongoing war on woke, President Trump has instructed the National Park Service to scrub any language he would deem negative, unpatriotic or smacking of improper partisan ideology from signs and presentations visitors encounter at national parks and historic sites.\n\nInstead, his administration has ordered the national parks and hundreds of other monuments and museums supervised by the Department of the Interior to ensure that all of their signage reminds Americans of our extraordinary heritage, consistent progress toward becoming a more perfect Union, and unmatched record of advancing liberty, prosperity and human flourishing.\n\nThose marching orders, which went into effect late last week, have left Trump opponents and free speech advocates gasping in disbelief, wondering how park employees are supposed to put a sunny spin on monuments acknowledging slavery, Jim Crow laws and the fight for civil rights. And how theyll square the story of Japanese Americans shipped off to incarceration camps during World War II with an unmatched record of advancing liberty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe whole thing is flabbergasting, said Dennis Arguelles, Southern California director for the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Assn. These stories may not be flattering to American heritage, but theyre an integral part of our history.\n\nIf we lose these stories, then were in danger of repeating some of these mistakes, Arguelles said.\n\nAt Manzanar National Historic Site, a dusty encampment in the high desert of eastern California, one of 10 camps where more than 120,000 Japanese American civilians were imprisoned during the early 1940s, employees put up a required notice describing the changes last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike all such notices across the country, it includes a QR code visitors can use to report any signs they see that are negative about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes.\n\nAn identical sign is up at the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument in Kern County, a tribute to the struggle to ensure better wages and safer working conditions for immigrant farm laborers. Such signs are going up across the sprawling system, which includes Fort Sumter National Monument, where Confederates fired the first shots of the Civil War; Fords Theater National Historic Site in Washington, D.C., where Abraham Lincoln was assassinated; and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Park.\n\nIn response to an email requesting comment, a National Park Service spokesperson did not address questions about specific parks or monuments, saying only that changes would be made where appropriate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump titled his March 27 executive order Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History. He instructed the Interior Department to scrutinize any signs put up since January 2020  the beginning of the Biden administration  for language that perpetuates a false reconstruction of American history.\n\nTrump called out signs that undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.\n\nHe specifically cited the National Historical Park in Philadelphia and the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C., as bowing to what he described as the previous administrations zeal to cast our Nations unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.\n\nHis order directs federal employees and historians to rewrite the revisionist history with language that exudes patriotism.\n\nIt all seems pretty Orwellian, said Kimbrough Moore, a rock climber and Yosemite National Park guide book author. After news of the impending changes began circulating in park circles, he posted on Instagram a sign he saw in the toilet at the Porcupine Flat campground in the middle of the park.\n\nAcross from the ubiquitous sign in all park bathrooms that says, Please DO NOT put trash in toilets, it is extremely difficult to remove, someone added a placard that reads, Please DO NOT put trash in the White House. It is extremely difficult to remove.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPredictably, the post went viral, proving what would-be censors have known for centuries: Policing language is a messy business and can be hard to control in a free society.\n\nEven the pooper can be a venue for resistance, Moore wrote."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "The manner of Moonlights Best Picture win at the Oscars may have been bizarre and shocking, but in toppling expected favorite La La Land, Barry Jenkinss film set a number of milestones. Its the lowest-budgeted film to win the prize since Delbert Manns Marty in 1955; if adjusting for inflation, its the lowest ever. Its the first movie centered on an LGBTQ character to be named Best Picture, and the first whose cast is entirely people of color. Beyond that, its incredible that Moonlight beat La La Land simply because the latter seemed like a film aimed at Academy votersa well-made original musical about artistry and Hollywood dreams, shot through with nostalgia for the industrys Golden Age.\n\nBut maybe it shouldnt be so surprising that Moonlight took Best Picture. Its a stunning film, but also in some ways one that fits a mold the Academy has been leaning toward in recent years. For decades, it was very unusual for the movie with the most awards of the night to lose the Best Picture race. But in recent years, thats been the norm. For decades, splits between Best Picture and Best Director (as happened at last nights Oscars) were a relative rarity; in the last 20 years, its happened 8 times. Moonlight is a unique film, and one that tells the kind of story the Academy Awards have largely ignored through its historybut its also the kind of smaller, more intimate tale that voters have started warming to.\n\nMoonlight won three Academy Awards this year: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Mahershala Ali), and Best Adapted Screenplay for Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney. Last years Best Picture winner Spotlight took only two trophies, and in 2015, Birdman won four. The year before that, 12 Years a Slave won three, as did Argo in 2013. In every case, there was another more opulent production that won at least as many trophies, if not more: The Revenant, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Gravity, and Life of Pi, respectively (with all but Budapest winning Best Director but not Best Picture). La La Land seems to belong to this new ticket-splitting norm, where voters chalk up a bunch of technical wins for the glitzy frontrunner, but give Best Picture to the more critically acclaimed, smaller production.\n\nAgain, this is not to discount Moonlights game-changing triumph. Though movies like Spotlight and Birdman were independent works, they were made on a much bigger budget and distributed by more established indie wings of major studios (Moonlights distributor was A24, a company founded only five years ago that has quickly become one of the most respected names in American art cinema). Still, only one major studio has won Best Picture in the last decadeWarner Bros. (for Argo and The Departed). As Hollywoods major production companies have tilted away from prestige films to focus more heavily on big tentpole franchises, the Best Picture nominations list is mostly filled with indie and mid-major companies, (with streaming service Amazon making its own breakthrough this year for Manchester by the Sea).\n\nIf things had been already edging in this direction, then Moonlight might be the beginning of an even bigger sea change. Of this years nine Best Picture nominees, it is the lowest-grossing (having made $22 million in the fourth months since its release, behind the next lowest Hell or High Water with $27 million). The Oscars used to have a certain reverence for perfectly well reviewed films that broke out in a major way. Its how consensus choices like A Beautiful Mind, Gladiator, Braveheart, and Forrest Gump took the prize over more acclaimed movies. La La Land fits that mold wellbut that mold may have been broken.\n\nIt helps that Moonlight was universally heralded, getting the kind of rapturous critical raves that come once in a generation, rather than once a year. It was also a beautifully made film on every level, attracting support from a wider swath of Academy branches (it was nominated for its music, cinematography, and editing along with the expected writing, acting, and directing nods). Thats crucial for a Best Picture win, because people from every Academy branch get to vote on the winners, and its what had kept smaller, less technically impressive indie movies from winning in the past. Perhaps next year the trophy will go to some big epic that hits at the box office, like Christopher Nolans Dunkirk, and this recent pattern will be upended. Either way, Moonlights win is shocking enough to be remembered forever. The thing to watch for now is if its a magical Oscars anomaly, or a sign of profound change for the Academy."

Under the new policy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Kazakhstan will face 25% import duties starting Aug. 1, while goods from Cambodia and Thailand are set for 36% tariffs.

Bangladesh and Serbia were told their goods would face 35% import rates, while goods from South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina sent to the United States would face duties of 30%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a Great Honor for me to send you this letter in that it demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship, Trump wrote in the letters, sending the same text to each foreign leader.\n\nMarkets recoiled at the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1.4%, the Nasdaq falling 1.2% and the Standard & Poors 500 sinking 1.2%.\n\nThe move essentially returns U.S. tariff rates on those countries to those Trump first announced on April 2, on what he called Liberation Day, but that he ultimately abandoned over widespread Wall Street panic that began spooking the bond market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump hit pause on the crisis by announcing a 90-day suspension of the higher tariff rates, a period set to expire Wednesday. But the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Monday that Trump would extend the deadline to the end of the month.\n\nSeveral senior officials in the Trump administration had promised a slew of trade deals would follow the April episode  were going to run 90 deals in 90 days, said Peter Navarro, the presidents top trade advisor. Yet the administration has failed to secure a single detailed trade deal, instead announcing three frameworks of understanding with the United Kingdom, China and Vietnam.\n\nThe president is taking a very deliberate approach to correcting this wrong of many decades, of many past presidents  I think he should be commended for the time and the effort that hes putting into this, Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that he has announced a framework with China, a trade deal with the U.K., a trade deal with Vietnam and many others to come in just six months is truly historic, and its a testament to this president and his trade team, she added.\n\nIn his letters to foreign leaders, Trump warned that any effort by their governments to retaliate would be met with escalation.\n\nIf for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 25% that we charge, he wrote.\n\nLeavitt said more letters would be sent in the coming days. She also stated that additional trade deals could be announced soon. We are close, she said.\n\nIn a separate post on his Truth Social platform, Trump warned that countries in BRICS  an economic partnership comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran  would face an additional 10% tariff if they adopt Anti-American policies at a summit in Rio de Janeiro this week.\n\nThere will be no exceptions to this policy, the president wrote.\n\nScott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, told CNBC in an interview that his inbox was full last night with a lot of new offers for trade deals ahead of the now-defunct Wednesday deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeve had a lot of people change their tune in terms of negotiations, Bessent said. So its going to be a busy couple of days.\n\nThe stock market reaction to Trumps Liberation Day tariffs, which hiked rates on countries all around the world, was an historic rout, eviscerating trillions of dollars in value, with the Standard & Poors index bleeding 12% in just four days.\n\nMarkets recovered within weeks, after Trump reversed course, with the S&P hitting a record high on Thursday."

Today, more than 5,300 firefighters with some 1,600 vehicles were battling the fires, some of which officials say were started by arsonists. Wildfires have also left at least four people dead in neighboring Spain.\n\nArmy Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl pleaded guilty today to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. He was captured by the Taliban in 2009, after leaving his post in Afghanistan. It prompted an intense search and a prisoner swap. Bergdahl appeared before a military judge in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, today. The 31-year-old could be sentenced to life in prison. He said his actions were very inexcusable, adding he didn't  quote  \"think there'd be any reason to pull off a crucial mission to look for one guy.\"\n\nThe truck driver in deadly immigrant smuggling run has pleaded guilty in court.

The driver, James Matthew Bradley Jr., pleaded to conspiracy and transporting immigrants, resulting in death.

The second didn't detonate. Officials said Rahimi was inspired by ISIS and al-Qaida.\n\nJOHN MILLER, Deputy Commissioner, NYPD Intelligence & Counterterrorism: Ahmed Khan Rahimi learned a lesson which we keep reminding people of.

        "content": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivers the keynote speech at the Emerge 20th Anniversary Gala in San Francisco on April 30.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris hasnt decided whether she will run for California governor next year, but a new poll released Wednesday shows that she would be a favorite of voters if she does.\n\nThough many voters were undecided, Harris was the choice of 41% of survey respondents, compared to 29% who opted for an unnamed Republican candidate, according to a poll by the University of California Irvine. She also had the greatest favorability ratings and is most well known compared to all of the candidates who have announced.\n\nThe path to governor seems well-paved for Vice President Harris if she decides to run, said Jon Gould, dean of UCIs School of Social Ecology, in a statement. Although she lacks majority support at the moment, people know her better than the other candidates and generally view her favorably.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris, who served as the states attorney general and U.S. senator, unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, became former President Joe Bidens vice president and then ran for president in 2024 in a whirlwind and unsuccessful campaign after Biden decided not to run for reelection.\n\nShe has kept a relatively low profile since losing the November presidential election, moving back to the Brentwood home she shares with husband Doug Emhoff. She has made some public appearances, most recently attending the Saturday funeral for Democratic former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed along with her husband in what a federal prosecutor has described as an assassination.\n\nHarris also recently delivered her most pointed remarks about President Trump and attended a high school graduation in Compton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly 5% of Californians had never heard of Harris, while every other announced candidate was unknown by a far larger number of respondents, including those who had run for statewide office previously. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who ran for governor in 2018, was unknown by 47% of survey respondents; 48% were unfamiliar with former Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine, who ran for U.S. Senate in 2024.\n\nWhen tested against candidates who have announced, Harris was the choice of 24% of voters, the only candidate to crack double digits, according to the poll. However, 40% of respondents were undecided, according to the poll.\n\nAmong Democrats, who account for 47% of the states voters as of February, Harris had the support of nearly half, while every announced candidate had single-digit support. Harris led among Californians in every region and in every racial group, according to the poll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBillionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 2022 and is reportedly debating whether to run for mayor again or governor, was the favored choice of GOP voters, with the backing of 27% of survey respondents.\n\nHarris, whose representatives did not respond to a request for comment, is expected to decide whether she enters the race by the end of the summer, a delay that has prompted criticism from several candidates in the crowded field of candidates who have already announced their bids.\n\nThe statewide poll of 4,143 Californians was conducted online in two separate polls, one between May 27 and June 2, and another between May 29 and June 4. The margin of error in either direction varies between 2.9% and 3.6%, according to UCI.\n\n"

        "content": "President Trump speaks with reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Tuesday.\n\nAn initial damage assessment by the Pentagon found that U.S. military strikes over the weekend failed to fully destroy Iranian nuclear sites, setting back Tehrans nuclear program by only a few months.\n\nThe Defense Intelligence Agencys classified report, which was first reported by CNN, casts doubt on the narrative President Trump and his officials have repeated since Sundays raid: that nuclear installations in Natanz, Fordo and Isfahan were completely and totally obliterated.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump insisted yet again that Iran would not be able to salvage anything of its nuclear program. That place is under rock, he said. That place is demolished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump administration officials acknowledged the assessments existence but pooh-poohed its findings, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying in a statement it was flat-out wrong.\n\nThe damage assessment came the same day Trump excoriated both Israel and Iran over what he said were violations of the surprise ceasefire between the two nations that was set to begin Tuesday morning.\n\nWe have two countries that have been fighting for so hard and so long that they dont know what the f they are doing, said an enraged Trump before leaving Washington for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the days since U.S. forces pummeled Iranian nuclear sites with bunker buster bombs, Iranian officials have downplayed the attack, insisting that the damage was mostly surface level and that, in any case, the countrys nuclear know-how remains intact.\n\nThe U.S. and Israel should know that this industry has roots in our country, and the roots of this national industry cannot be destroyed, said Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency on Sunday.\n\nOf course, we have suffered some losses, but this is not the first time that the industry has suffered damage. ... Naturally, this industry must continue, and its growth will not stop, Kamalvandi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhead of the strikes, there was little consensus in the defense community as to whether the United States Massive Ordnance Penetrators  30,000-pound bombs that can be delivered only by the B-2 bomber  could wipe out Fordo, a facility buried almost 300 feet under a mountain. Such bombs, weapons experts say, use their sheer weight to drill as far down as 200 feet before exploding. Multiple bombs can hit the same point, penetrating deeper with each missile, a technique one expert described as digging with bombs.\n\nOther observers say Iran had transported much of the uranium at Fordo, its main nuclear enrichment center, off-site ahead of the strikes. A day after the U.S. strikes, Israel struck Fordo once more, hitting access roads leading to the facility.\n\nExperts estimate that Iran still has no less than 19,800 pounds of uranium enriched at levels between 2% and 60%. The International Atomic Energy Agency will have to account for the whereabouts of that uranium.\n\nOne of the big questions is the status of Irans stockpiles of enriched material, since this is what it would use to feed into an enrichment site to produce weapons-grade plutonium, said Eric Brewer, deputy vice president of the Nuclear Materials Security Program for Nuclear Threat Initiative, a Washington think tank.\n\nIts entirely unclear where these are today because they could be used to construct a covert facility, Brewer said.\n\nTehran insists it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes, and U.S. intelligence assessments before the war said it was not working toward weaponization  a view Trump contradicted. Even if a bomb was a goal, experts say, it would take months to enrich uranium to weapons-grade, and Iran would need more time to package it in a missile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael has for years accused Iran of running a clandestine nuclear weapons program, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly warned an Iranian bomb was imminent.\n\nNetanyahu launched a devastating campaign June 13 in a bid to destroy Irans nuclear facilities and ballistic missile arsenal and to kill key military leaders.\n\nThe leak of the initial damage assessment was the work of an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community, Leavitt said.\n\nThe leaking of this alleged assessment, she added, is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Irans nuclear program. Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000-pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\n\nThe state of Irans nuclear program is likely to be a pivotal issue in terms of whether a shaky ceasefire brokered by Trump and Qatars leadership early Tuesday would hold.\n\nShare via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe details of the ceasefire  negotiated hours after a limited volley of Iranian ballistic missiles targeted the United States Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday  remain unclear, but it spurred cautious optimism across the Middle East.\n\nIts fragility was underscored when Israel accused Iran of breaking the agreement mere hours after it was supposed to take effect, with the military saying that it intercepted a pair of ballistic missiles fired from Iran and that it would respond.\n\nIrans chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Abdolrahim Mousavi, denied any launch after the truces beginning, according to Iranian official media. A later statement by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said 14 missiles were fired in the last minutes before the ceasefire.\n\nA visibly enraged Trump castigated both sides for the violations, saying he was not happy with either country. These guys gotta calm down, he said.\n\nLater, he took to his social media platform to tell Israel to BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!\n\nIsraeli officials later told reporters that warplanes carried out a small strike against an Iranian radar north of Tehran around the time Trump was talking to reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA statement from the prime ministers office said: Following President Trumps conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from additional attacks.\n\nIrans Supreme National Security Council, the governmental body in charge of military affairs, took a similarly triumphant tone in its statement agreeing to the ceasefire, saying that Irans victory forced the enemy to regret and accept defeat and unilaterally halt its attack.\n\nIt added, however, that Iranian forces will remain with their hands on the trigger.\n\nIrans attacks on Israel killed 28 people and wounded more than 1,000 others, including the victims of Tuesdays strike. Israels campaign has killed 610 people and wounded 4,746 since the war began, according to Irans Health Ministry.\n\nThat a ceasefire was brokered at all came as a surprise. In the hours before Trumps announcement, Iran lobbed missiles at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest U.S. military installation in the region with about 10,000 U.S. troops and its Central Command headquarters.\n\nBut although it initially triggered fears of a rapid expansion of the conflict, Irans attack proved to be relatively subdued, less the mighty and powerful response it vowed before the barrage than a pre-choreographed, face-saving gesture designed to be largely symbolic. Trump said Monday that Iran had warned the U.S. of the attack in advance.\n\nQatar said the attack was a flagrant violation of its sovereignty and airspace, and promised it would respond in an appropriate manner. Instead, in a measure of the urgency felt by Persian Gulf nations to prevent a wider conflagration, the Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani coordinated with Trump and Vice President JD Vance to end the hostilities, according to an official briefed on the talks and who requested anonymity to be able to speak freely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Tehran on Tuesday, there was a mood of tentative joy at the end of what had been a bruising couple of weeks for the capital. Still, many expressed the feeling of being betrayed by the international community.\n\nIran was left with very few options, said Venus Shahri, a 40-year-old teacher from Tehran.\n\nOthers said that although they were disappointed by the defensive capabilities of Irans army, they wanted to double down on the fight.\n\nWe shouldnt have accepted the ceasefire offer at all, said Jaber Khadiri, 55. We must have nuclear weapons. Theres no other choice."

Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss what the presidents move could mean for the U.S. military.\n\nTrump, in his first term, tried to assert control over the military in a way that went beyond what the commander in chief does, not just as a defense for the country against external enemies but as a tool, potentially, for internal use when he had domestic criticism, Peter Baker said last night. Clearly, there is a decision that C. Q. Brown is not someone [Trump] can trust to carry out his bidding.\n\nWhether Browns firing will be an isolated one, or the beginning of a wholesale purge of generals, remains unknown, Susan Glasser said. Trump has made it very clear that he wants people who are loyal to him personally and not to the office, not to the Constitution, she continued. Trumps agenda really suggests a politicization of the nonpartisan leadership of Americas armed forces if generals are being replaced on the basis of perceived political loyalty to the president.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has also aligned with Russias Vladimir Putin on ending the war in Ukraine and has falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the conflict. Panelists discussed whats behind the presidents pivot toward Putin.\n\nJoining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times; Susan Glasser, a staff writer at The New Yorker; Jonathan Lemire, a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a co-host of Morning Joe on MSNBC.\n\nWatch the full episode here."

This is also the politicization of intelligence, he continued, which is precisely what [Gabbard] said she was going to root out in the intelligence community.\n\nJoining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Shane Harris, a staff writer at The Atlantic; David Ignatius, a columnist for The Washington Post; Andrea Mitchell, the chief Washington and foreign-affairs correspondent at NBC News; and Ashley Parker, a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\nWatch the full episode here."

        "content": "The Internal Revenue Service agreed in a court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without fear of losing their tax-exempt status.\n\nThe IRS made the statement in a court case challenging the Johnson Amendment, a 1954 U.S. tax code provision that prohibits all 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations  including churches  from formally endorsing or opposing political candidates.\n\nIn a filing Monday aimed at resolving a lawsuit between the National Religious Broadcasters and others against the IRS, the parties jointly agreed that churches can endorse candidates without fear of losing their tax-exempt status. The agreement likens such endorsements to a \"family discussion concerning candidates.\"\n\nWhen a house of worship in good faith speaks to its congregation, through its customary channels of communication on matters of faith in connection with religious services, concerning electoral politics viewed through the lens of religious faith, it neither 'participate[s]' nor 'intervene[s]' in a 'political campaign,' within the ordinary meaning of those words, the parties wrote in the filing in federal court for the Eastern District of Texas, which was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nThus, communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted.\n\nThe joint motion for a consent judgement in the case must be approved by a judge before the lawsuit is formally resolved.\n\nA spokesperson for the IRS and a lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThen-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, D-Texas, in 1956. Ed Kolenovsky / AP file\n\nThe amendment was named after Lyndon B. Johnson, who sponsored it in the Senate. Johnson had pushed for the rule in response to conservative nonprofits that supported a political rival.\n\nThe amendment has rarely been enforced when it comes to churches. The Washington Post reported in 2017 that more than 2,000 pastors had publicly defied the Johnson Amendment in organized demonstrations. Only one of the pastors was investigated, and none were punished, the paper reported.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been a vocal opponent of the amendment. He vowed to \"get rid of and totally destroy\" it at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, adding that doing so would \"allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.\"\n\nWhile the IRS action doesn't go that far  getting rid of the amendment would require an act of Congress  it does target the specific provision Trump complained about.\n\nLloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a professor at Notre Dame Law School, said that if approved, the joint motion would technically apply only to the churches that filed suit, but the language in it \"is basically giving the green light for churches to endorse candidates from the pulpit and not have to worry about IRS enforcement while President Donald Trump is in office.\"\n\nHe predicted the move will have two major ramifications.\n\n\"The first is that churches that maybe were hesitant to endorse candidates have less of a reason to be hesitant\" and are \"going to feel freer to support candidates from the pulpit,\" Mayer said.\n\n\"The second ramification is even church leaders who dont want to get involved will feel pressure to do so, from political candidates and members of their congregation,\" potentially putting pastors \"in an awkward position.\"\n\nThat pressure could include financial incentives from congregants who could try to sway churches with donations, Mayer said.\n\nThe religious groups' suit argued a change was necessary because churches were unfairly targeted by the amendment, and they sought to have the entire amendment declared unconstitutional.\n\n\"The IRS operates in a manner whereby the Plaintiffs are in jeopardy of punishment if they forthrightly say that a candidates positions are unbiblical; or that another candidates positions are consonant with biblical teaching,\" their suit says. \"The Plaintiffs speech is clearly chilled in this regard because they are not free to proclaim their views on the issues of the day and then compare their views with the views of the candidates on these same issues.\"\n\nAs part of the joint motion, the religious groups agreed to drop their constitutionality claims against the amendment as a whole, so it would still apply to other 501(c)(3) tax exempt organizations, including charities and universities."

        "content": "NATO members have agreed to more than double their defense spending in a move widely lauded as a historic step toward a more equal security relationship between the United States and its European partners. The effort may also be redefining concepts of military defense.\n\nEach members target security budget is now 5% of national gross domestic product. But of that, 3.5% of GDP is going toward traditional military spending  troops and hardware like guns and fighter jets  and 1.5% is planned to be domestic projects that count as defense spending, too.\n\nThis defense-adjacent spending can include everything from improving roads and railways to better accommodate tanks to fuzzier soft power items like societal resilience.\n\nWhy We Wrote This European nations have pledged more NATO funding partly through a novel redefinition of defense. From bridges to efforts at civilian resilience, the new efforts are criticized as gimmicks by some, but others see a more holistic approach to security.\n\nThis comes after years of complaints by President Donald Trump that NATO members have been taking advantage of U.S. military largesse. Following the late-June NATO summit at The Hague, the president said he was pleased with the outcome, calling it a big win for Europe and  Western civilization.\n\nOthers see it as an invitation for creative accounting. By way of example, some point to Italys plans to build a bridge it has sought since ancient times, connecting Sicily with the mainland. At an estimated cost of $16 billion, its long been deemed prohibitively pricey. With the argument that it could help move NATO troops south should the need arise, it could now count toward Italys 5% goal.\n\nIf defense is understood as a whole-of-society effort, what can genuinely be excluded from the accounting? a report from the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank, asks.\n\nClaudia Greco/Reuters Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni speaks to the media at a NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, June 25, 2025. A planned $16 billion bridge connecting Sicily with the Italian mainland may count toward Italys defense commitments, since the bridge could be used by the military as well as by civilians.\n\nYet this sizable range of security projects could also broaden and shift the definition of what safety means in helpful ways, analysts say, by shoring up the democracies of the alliance through investments in everything from child care to commercial undersea cables to investments in Indigenous communities. Such spending comes with the message that defense means many different things, that it matters, and that citizens have a critical role to play in keeping their countries safe.\n\nTheres a reason that societal cohesion is so important, says Rachel Rizzo, senior fellow at the Atlantic Councils Europe Center. Cracks and fissures are ... easily exploitable by our would-be adversaries.\n\nBuilding this unity means reaching out to skeptical European citizens, too, since the defense spending hikes come with concerns that NATO states will take those billions from health care, from social security, from education, Marcos Perestrello, the Portuguese president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, told an audience at The Hague.\n\nIn fact, many NATO countries are still figuring out where the money will come from. Belgiums foreign minister said his country has three options: to reduce government spending, to take on more debt, or to generate new revenue, potentially through taxation.\n\nSince these are not particularly popular choices, the alliance plans to push the idea that citizens will reap rewards like jobs through investments in technology and space with the newly pledged NATO funds, said Mr. Perestrello, a member of his countrys Socialist party.\n\nThere are existential benefits as well, he added. We need to be able to explain that you have no health care, no education, and no social security if you have no security.\n\nAn East-West divide within NATO\n\nSince the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, its been a maxim that the further from the front lines, the less interested citizens will be in bigger defense budgets.\n\nThis was born out by some person-on-the-street videos shot by summit organizers and aired in between policy talks at the gathering. Respondents answered questions about, among other things, being drafted and whether they supported their countries budgeting more for defense.\n\nA young man named Tom from Luxembourg said hes open to boosting military spending, but in a reasonable amount so as not to provoke Russian invasion.\n\nOne Eastern European panelist, upon seeing the video, pronounced himself provoked by Toms answer.\n\nIn another discussion, Latvian Minister of Defense Andris Sprds said, If you say in Latvia that you spend less than 5% [on defense] you might be losing elections.\n\nVirginia Mayo/AP German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius (center) speaks with Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur (second from left) and Latvian Defense Minister Andris Sprds (second from right) at NATO headquarters in Brussels, June 4, 2025.\n\nThe topic of just how much average voters want to give to NATO was a big one at the summit, particularly among European Union parliamentarians with eyes on polls.\n\nBecause a boost in defense spending is a particularly tough sell for politicians in Spain given national debt levels, that nation was the sole NATO member to negotiate an exception to the 5% pledge, in part by promising to spend 2% of its GDP on defense by the end of 2025.\n\nIn the Netherlands, some $21 billion will need to be freed up to go toward the 5% defense spending, says Anna van Zoest, director of the Netherlands Atlantic Association. Thats going to have to come from somewhere. So having at least some slight understanding of whats at stake is the responsibility of all of us.\n\nThis understanding can arise in very practical ways. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, energy prices rose throughout the alliance. It also comes, analysts say, through an appreciation, and a shoring up, of the democracies the alliance is defending through investments in people and infrastructure.\n\nTo this end, France is organizing war games to help people respond to societal disruptions like power cuts and massive disinformation campaigns.\n\nEstonias foreign minister has said that through investments in national railways alone, his country has likely already met the target.\n\nIn Canada, officials in the Yukon are investing in, among other things, projects in Indigenous communities that serve the needs of locals as well as that of the military, according to a Yukon Arctic Security Advisory Council report.\n\nOther countries are investing in cybersecurity, the protection of commercial undersea cables  which, if severed, could interrupt communications  and even cold storage for the better transport of refrigerated food and medical supplies, particularly during times of conflict.\n\nMatthias Schrader/AP European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives for the NATO defense forum on the sidelines of the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, June 24, 2025.\n\nStockpiling not just weapons, but also food\n\nIn an effort to encourage more cooperation with the civilian sector, NATOs political leaders are trying to be more transparent  and perhaps a bit more humble, Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kstutis Budrys told an audience at the NATO summit.\n\nHe recalled trying to loop in businesses to a security problem Lithuania was wrestling with: how to store up food supplies so citizens would have enough to eat for months in the event that Russia, say, cut them off.\n\nIn the past, when businesses asked follow-up questions to help puzzle out solutions, the Lithuanian government would tell them that the answers were secret. Its not for you to know, we were saying to businesses. You will get what you need to know when the war starts, Mr. Budrys said.\n\nBut the government learned a lot by opening up, he added. The first thing [farmers and businesses] said was, Look, it doesnt work like this. You dont understand how the business functions.\n\nNow, he says, his country will be more resilient in the face of potential adversarial pressure.\n\nResilience  and how to grow it  came up a lot during the NATO summit, including among military officers.\n\nIts not only giving the war to the military and saying, Fight wars, said Adm. Pierre Vandier, who heads NATOs Allied Command Transformation.\n\nThe shift involves not just thinking of defense as more than guns and military means, but also actively engaging citizens, such as in stockpiling supplies, said Linas Kojala, CEO of the Geopolitics and Security Studies Center, a Lithuanian think tank.\n\nYet how to boost readiness and societal resilience without scaremongering can be tricky, NATO officials acknowledge, particularly when geography plays a role.\n\nHearing you talk about preparedness in Lithuania, its a totally foreign concept to me because Im American and we are surrounded by two massive oceans, said Ms. Rizzo of the Atlantic Council.\n\nJust having conversations like these contribute to a shared sense of unity and purpose among allies, NATO officials say.\n\nIts not about handing Mr. Trump a win, Mr. Kojala argued. No. Its for our own sake  for our security.\n\nThis unity gives the alliance not only the capability to fight wars, he added, but the credibility and broadened mandate it needs to forestall them.\n\nAs NATO allies broaden their definition of defense spending, we'll look later this week at how one sub-Arctic corner of Canada is aiming to bolster security using this new mind-set."

        "content": "Newly released interviews and documentation further bolster evidence that Hamas systematically used sexual violence as a weapon of war during its Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, according to a report by a group of Israeli gender and legal scholars.\n\nThe report unveiled Tuesday, titled \"A Quest for Justice,\" was published by the Dinah Project, a legal research initiative led by Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, women's rights activist and law professor at of Tel Avivs Bar-Ilan University; Sharon Zagagi-Pinhas, a lawyer and the former chief military prosecutor at the Israel Defense Forces; and Nava Ben-Or, a former judge and deputy attorney general.\n\nPartly funded by the British government and Jewish nonprofit organizations, the report contains previously unheard accounts from 15 returned hostages from Gaza, along with testimony from a rape survivor from the Nova music festival, one of at least six different locations where Hamas carried out its attacks.\n\nIt also includes eyewitness testimony from at least 17 different incidents of sexual assault, as well as accounts from first responders, forensic evidence, and audio and visual documentation.\n\nMemorials at the Nova music festival site in May 2024. Leo Correa / AP\n\nThe issue of sexual assault and rape during the Oct. 7 attacks is highly emotive and charged, with some in Israel accusing United Nations observers of betraying survivors by downplaying the issue. Meanwhile, some international observers, including a United Nations official appointed to investigate, say that while there is evidence of cases of rape and sexual assault, this evidence does not point to those incidents having been systematic or directed by militant leaders.\n\nHamas has denied that its militants committed sexual crimes on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nThe report states that clear patterns emerged of sexual violence being perpetrated, including victims who were found partially or fully naked with their hands tied, often to structures like trees or poles; evidence of gang rapes followed by execution; genital mutilation; and public humiliation. The details add to and corroborate past reporting on sexual violence that took place during the attacks.\n\nThe sexual violence \"continued in captivity, with many returnees reporting forced nudity, physical and verbal sexual harassment, sexual assaults and threats of forced marriage, the report adds.\n\nThe victims also include two returned male hostages who were released in January and February after being held captive for about 500 days, where they were subjected to \"sexual humiliation, which included forced nudity and physical abuse when naked,\" according to the report.\n\nIn light of the testimonies, the report aims to have the sexual violence acknowledged as crimes against humanity and to hold the perpetrators accountable.\n\nNotably, it calls on the U.N. to send a fact-finding mission and blacklist Hamas as a group. We hence call upon the U.N. Secretary-General to blacklist Hamas as an organization responsible for the tactical use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, it states.\n\nSecurity forces at the Nova music festival site on Oct. 12, 2023 in Kibbutz Re'im, Israel. Leon Neal / Getty Images file\n\nReem Alsalem, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, said in a statement that she and fellow rapporteurs and experts emphasized that reports of such violence needed to be independently verified and investigated and perpetrators be held accountable.\n\nShe added that the U.N. special commission appointed to investigate \"found patterns indicative of sexual violence against Israeli women at different locations. The Commission was also unable to independently verify specific allegations of sexual and gender-based violence due to Israels obstruction of its investigations.\"\n\n\"It is my understanding that neither the Commission nor any other independent human rights mechanism established that sexual or gender-based violence was committed against Israelis on or since the 7th of October as a systematic tool of war or as a tool of genocide,\" Alsalem wrote in the statement.\n\nThe Dinah Project report's findings follow previously published reports by the U.N. and the International Criminal Court on sexual violence and gang rape during the attack.\n\nIn March 2024, a report compiled by Pramila Patten, the U.N. Special Representative on sexual violence in conflict, stated that it had found reasonable grounds to believe some victims of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 were raped and sexually assaulted.\n\nThere was clear and convincing information that some of those taken captive were subjected to sexual violence, the U.N. team of experts said in their report, including rape and sexualized torture  violence it said may be ongoing.\n\nIn December 2023, NBC News published a separate report which reviewed evidence suggesting that dozens of Israeli women were raped, sexually abused or mutilated during the Oct. 7 attack, where more than 1,200 people were killed in Israel.\n\nSince then, Israels ongoing military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 56,000 people and seriously injured thousands more, according to health officials in the enclave.\n\nThe Dinah Project's report also comes after a U.N.-backed body, the Human Rights Council, released an extensive report in March this year that accused Israel of the systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe report by the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory found that the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas, and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities had led to disproportionate violence against women and children.\n\nWhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address the latest report's findings, he called the organization an anti-Israel circus."

        "content": "Good morning. The war in Gaza  which began with the horror of the Hamas slaughter and kidnapping of Israeli civilians on 7 October 2023, and has brought unimaginable death and destruction to the population of Gaza almost every day since  has entered its 21st month.\n\nSo far every attempt to end the conflict has failed. But the the fraying patience of the US president, Donald Trump, who has promised to deliver peace to Gaza, has seen Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu dispatch a team of negotiators to Qatar for indirect talks with Hamas, with the Israeli leader expected to come under pressure on this weeks trip to Washington DC to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nYet despite Trumps desire to end the war, and Israel and Hamas making positive noises about the prospect of a ceasefire, the two sides are still far apart on a number of crucial negotiating points.\n\nLast night, just hours before Netanyahu told Trump at a White House dinner that he had nominated him for the Nobel peace prize, Israel laid out a plan that would force all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp on the ruins of Rafah, in a scheme that legal experts described as a blueprint for crimes against humanity.\n\nFor todays newsletter, I talked to the Guardians Middle East correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison about the prospects for peace, and what is at stake for everyone involved. First, the headlines.\n\nFive big stories\n\nImmigration | Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce plans for French police to do more to block small boats crossing the Channel at a summit in London this week, but a wider deal on returning asylum seekers is still up in the air. Iran | The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said in an interview released on Monday that Israel, which last month fought a 12-day war with Iran, had attempted to assassinate him by bombarding an area in which he was holding a meeting. Poverty | Children in England are living in almost Dickensian levels of poverty where deprivation has become normalised, the childrens commissioner has said, as she insisted the two-child benefit limit must be scrapped. Environment | Millions of tonnes of treated sewage sludge is spread on farmland across the UK every year despite containing forever chemicals, microplastics and toxic waste. An investigation by the Guardian and Watershed has identified Englands sludge-spreading hotspots and shown where the practice could be damaging rivers. US news | The Texas senator Ted Cruz ensured the Republican spending bill slashed funding for weather forecasting, only to then go on vacation to Greece while his state was hit by deadly flooding  a disaster that critics say was worsened by cuts to meteorology.\n\nIn depth: What a new ceasefire might look like  and the risks if it fails\n\nView image in fullscreen Aftermath of an Israeli strike that destroyed homes at a refugee camp in Gaza City last week. Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/Reuters\n\nA few hours before Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump met yesterday, the latest rounds of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Doha ended without a breakthrough. Despite this, Trump insisted at a dinner with Netanyahu last night that negotiations were going along very well.\n\nIf a new ceasefire is agreed and does come into effect, it will be the third during a war that has claimed the lives of at least 57,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians.\n\nThe first ceasefire  in November 2023  lasted just 10 days. The second, in February and March this year, collapsed after Israel reneged on its promise to move to a second phase that could have seen a definitive end to the conflict.\n\nIn the months since, a new Israeli offensive has claimed the lives of thousands more Palestinians. Extreme hunger is everywhere after an 11-week siege and ongoing tight blockade, with only minimal food and aid allowed in.\n\nWhat are the terms of this new proposed ceasefire?\n\nThe details of this new deal include the staggered release of 10 living hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas, and the return of the bodies of 18 more, in exchange for a number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. There would also be more aid entering the area and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from some parts of the Gaza Strip.\n\nLike the previous ceasefires, it will last for 60 days, with Trump and regional allies guaranteeing Hamas that Israel will engage in meaningful talks to bring about a permanent end to the war.\n\nThe deal would leave 22 hostages, 10 of them believed to be alive, still held in Gaza.\n\nHow strong is Netanyahus position with Trump?\n\nEmma Graham-Harrison said that, on paper, Donald Trump has most of the leverage, which he is using to push a reluctant Netanyahu to the negotiating table.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the world watched as Trump publicly eviscerated Israel for breaking a tentative ceasefire with Iran. He had already forced the Israeli prime minister to turn around fighter jets on their way to Iran  a display of raw power over Israels leader that Emma said is unprecedented.\n\nSince Trumps F-word outburst, the two allies have once again appeared in lockstep, with the US going on to launch a bombing run in support of Israel against Irans nuclear programme, handing Netanyahu a huge political boost.\n\nTrump has also backed Netanyahu on a number of other key political issues, calling for corruption charges facing the Israeli prime minister to be dropped and continuing to back his policy for distributing food to Palestinians in Gaza through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), despite hundreds of Palestinians being shot and killed while trying to reach the distribution points.\n\nNetanyahu has made sure that he appears to be taking Trumps demands for an end to the war seriously; for example sending a team of negotiators to the ceasefire talks in Doha, said Emma.\n\nAt last nights dinner, Trump was upbeat about the prospect of a ceasefire. When the US president was asked about Israels reported plans to force all Palestinians in Gaza into a new humanitarian city built on the ruins of Rafah, Trump directed Netanyahu to answer the question. In response Netanyahu said he was working with the US on finding countries that will give Palestinians a better future.\n\nDoes Netanyahu really want to end the war?\n\nWhile Netanyahu is aware he needs to appease Trumps desire to present himself as a peacemaker by announcing a ceasefire, Emma said that Netanyahus critics say he has multiple, compelling reasons not to want a lasting end to the war.\n\nHe is still very much beholden to far-right parties within his coalition government who are vehemently opposed to a ceasefire. National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and finance minister Bezalel Smotrich have both threatened to leave the government if Netanyahu ends the war.\n\nThere are very powerful voices in the Israeli government who are openly on a messianic mission to ethnically cleanse Gaza , said Emma.\n\nThere is also the separate issue of that corruption trial which, even with Trumps support, he may not be able to avoid if he loses political office.\n\nA third reason Netanyahu might want to keep the war going, Emma said, is that it allows him to delay any official examination of how the 7 October attacks happened on his watch. She thinks one possible option is that Netanyahu could attempt a political fudge, accepting a ceasefire and appearing to agree to Trumps plan that it should lead to a permanent end to the war, while telling allies at home that Israel can return to fighting once the 10 hostages are home.\n\nWhat about Hamas?\n\nThe hostages held by Hamas are the groups only significant leverage in the talks, said Emma.\n\nMilitarily, Hamas has been crippled by Israels relentless assault and obliteration of its senior leadership, (although Emma pointed out that Hamas is far from eliminated as a fighting force.\n\nAgreeing to give up more hostages in a situation that doesnt seem to be concretely leading to a permanent end to the war is arguably not that attractive an option for them, says Emma. I think their key aim now will be to end the war in a way that preserves some kind of power and influence in Gaza and trying to making sure that some elements of their organisation are still functioning.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you whats happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aid workers are saying that fuel stocks are close to running out, which would lead to the complete collapse of humanitarian operations, the health system and communications.\n\nAmid all the discussions about the ceasefire, the voices of Palestinian people themselves have seldom been heard, so I want to end this newsletter with Lama, a 12-year Palestinian girl who was interviewed by our Gaza correspondent Malak A Tantesh about what is really at stake if peace is not achieved.\n\nI was so happy during the last ceasefire. We felt a bit safe. When the war returned, I cried a lot because it meant going back to the suffering of tents, the summer heat and repeated displacement, Lama said.\n\nWhen asked about what she was afraid of if the ceasefire talks failed, she told Malak that she was scared of being torn apart, killed, paralysed or losing a limb.\n\nWhat else weve been reading\n\nView image in fullscreen Erin Patterson has been found guilty of murdering three relatives with a mushroom lunch at her home in regional Australia.

        "content": "Rightwing influencers in the US who are often aligned with Donald Trump are angry that a joint justice department and FBI memo has dismissed the existence of a client list in the case against late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe disgraced financier killed himself in a jail cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City in 2019 while awaiting prosecution on child sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges.\n\nAlmost ever since, Epsteins death has been the subject of conspiracy theories on the right, including a supposed client list that he purportedly used to blackmail wealthy co-conspirators.\n\nTrumps presidential administration then created anticipation that the alleged list would be publicly disclosed, including the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who had told Fox News in an interview: Its sitting on my desk right now to review.\n\nBut then a review conducted by the justice department and FBI revealed no incriminating client list, said an unsigned and undated memo first obtained by Axios on Sunday.\n\nThe memo added: There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\n\nFurther, the two-page, undated and unsigned memo stated that the government holds roughly 300 gigabytes of the evidence against Epstein, but that much of it would never be released because it contained identifying details about victims of trafficking or child abuse imagery.\n\nOnly a fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial  as the seal served only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing, the memo stated.\n\nThose findings have prompted rightwing influencers who are frequently in favor of Trumps policies to suggest that the federal government is protecting a powerful cabal of pedophiles.\n\nSome rightwing activists have even argued that the deep state  a term they use to describe what they purport to be a permanent government of bureaucrats and operatives in place to thwart Trump  is more muscular than they imagined.\n\nContextualizing all of this  this seems like unforgivable behavior, conservative influencer Liz Wheeler said on the Glenn Beck show on Monday, according to the New Republic.\n\nTrump has to fire Pam Bondi, said Keith and Kevin Hodge, known as the Hodge Twins on social media. She went on camera and told the world she has the Epstein client list on her desk  Now they say there is no list??\n\nConspiracy theorist and Infowars host Alex Jones added in an X post: Next the [justice department] will say, Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed.

But they contained little if any new information that wasnt already publicly available.\n\nHow could [Bondi] give the American people those phase 1 binders that contained nothing? Wheeler said after the new memo first reported by Axios.\n\nAsked about Epstein by a reporter at the White House on Tuesday, Trump irately deflected.\n\nAre you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? Trump said. This guys been talked about for years. Are people still talking about this guy? This creep? That is unbelievable.\n\nHe also claimed it seems like a desecration to discuss Epstein after the 4 July flash flooding in Texas that had killed more than 100 people.\n\nThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, had also previously been pressed about the administrations statements with respect to Epstein. She recently argued Bondi used the term client list to refer to the entirety of evidence against Epstein.\n\nShe was saying the entirety of all of the paperwork, all of the paper, in relation to Jeffrey Epsteins crimes, thats what the attorney general was referring to, and Ill let her speak for that, Leavitt said."

But right now we are focusing on the surface of the water first,\" Surabaya Search and Rescue head Nanang Sigit said.\n\nThe five bodies located by rescuers will be taken to their families in Banyuwangi, Sigit said.\n\nRelatives wait for updates on the search operation after a ferry sank off the Indonesian resort island of Bali, on Thursday. STR / AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe KMP Tunu Pratama Jaya sank almost half an hour after leaving Ketapang port in the East Java town of Banyuwangi late Wednesday for a trip of about 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) to Bali's Gilimanuk port, authorities said.\n\nA helicopter and 15 boats searched for survivors with assistance from fishermen and people onshore.\n\nWeather was a significant factor in the search effort. Strong waves up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) high and darkness hampered emergency responders overnight. While conditions improved Thursday morning, Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency indicated waves reached up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) with strong currents and winds Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"For today's search we are focusing on searching on the water, as the initial victims were found in the water between the location of the accident toward Gilimanuk port,\" Sigit said in a statement Thursday morning.\n\nAn officer at the port witnessed the sinking before rescuers could be alerted.\n\n\"The ferry could not be contacted via radio from the beginning. Then it could be contacted by other ships from the same company. But the ship was already in a tilting condition,\" Sigit said.\n\nMany of those rescued were unconscious after drifting in choppy waters for hours, Banyuwangi Police Chief Rama Samtama Putra said.\n\nIndonesian authorities are investigating the cause of the accident. Survivors told rescuers there appeared to be a leak in the engine room of the ferry, which was carrying 22 vehicles including 14 trucks.\n\nSome family members arrived at the port in a panic or weeping as they sought information about their loved ones.\n\nSurvivors were taken to nearby medical facilities including Jembrana Regional Hospital in Bali.\n\n\"When the ferry started to tilt, I initially intended to jump into the sea, but the ship quickly sank, so I did not jump any more but sank with the water entering the ship, maybe about 7 meters (23 feet) deep, so I immediately climbed up to the top,\" said Supardi, 64, a survivor at the hospital.\n\nHe and three other people grouped together in the water and used life jackets to say afloat, he said.\n\nFerry tragedies are common in Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, where ferries are often used as transport and safety regulations can lapse."

        "content": "Its a worldwide shift that has taken political scientists and sociologists by surprise: the growing ideological divide between young men and women.\n\nIn the recent U.S. presidential election, President Trump won 56% of the vote among men ages 18 to 29, according to an analysis from Tufts Universitys Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.\n\nIn Germany , young men are twice as likely as young women to support the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, according to the Pew Research Center. Last years European Parliament elections showed a similar trend. According to the European Policy Center, in Portugal, Denmark and Croatia, more than four young men voted for far-right candidates for every young woman who did the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut few countries exemplify the trend more than South Korea, where a recent presidential election showed just how polarized its youth has become.\n\nIn South Korea, 74.1% of men in their 20s and 60.3% of men in their 30s voted for one of the two conservative candidates compared with 35.6% and 40.5% of their female counterparts, respectively.\n\nExperts say the so-called 2030 male (men in their 20s and 30s) phenomenon, which emerged alongside the mainstreaming of gender equality discourse in South Korea over the last decade, has defied traditional left-right taxonomies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2030 men are difficult to define under standard electoral theory frameworks, said Kim Yeun-sook, a political scientist at Seoul National Universitys Institute of Korean Political Studies.\n\nHaving come of age in a world with radically different social contracts than those of their parents, right-leaning 2030 male voters are less likely to focus on North Korea  a defining preoccupation for older conservatives  than on feminism, which for them has become a dirty word that conjures freeloading women trying to take more than they are owed.\n\nThe men have taken umbrage with visual symbols or hand gestures  such as a pinched forefinger and thumb  that they argue are anti-male dog whistles used by feminists, in some cases succeeding in getting companies to discontinue marketing campaigns featuring such offending content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Korean women supporting the #MeToo movement stage a rally to mark the upcoming International Womens Day in Seoul on March 4, 2018. (Ahn Young-joon / Associated Press)\n\nIn the 2022 presidential election, it was men in their 20s and 30s who helped Yoon Suk Yeol  the conservative candidate who claimed that structural sexism no longer existed  clinch a razor-thin victory over his liberal opponent, Lee Jae-myung, who was elected president in June.\n\nThis perception that men  not women  are the true victims of gender discrimination in contemporary society is a defining belief for many young South Korean men, says Chun Gwan-yul, a data journalist and the author of 20-something Male, a book about the phenomenon that draws on extensive original polling of young South Koreans.\n\nAlthough male backlash to contemporary feminism is the most visible aspect of the phenomenon, Kim Chang-hwan, a sociologist at the University of Kansas, says that its roots go back to socioeconomic changes that began much earlier.\n\nAmong them was a series of government policies three decades earlier that led to a surge in both male and female college enrollment, which soared from around 30% of the general population in 1990 to 75% in 2024. Add to that the increasingly long-term participation of women in the workforce, Kim said, and the supply of educated labor has ended up outpacing economic growth.\n\nThe young men of today are now feeling like they are having to compete five times harder than the previous generation, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Despite the fact that gender inequality in South Koreas job market is among the worst in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with women making on average around 65% of their male counterparts and far more likely to be precariously employed, such wage gaps tend to be less prominent for earners in their 20s.)\n\nAnd although most research has shown that the negative effect of South Koreas male-only compulsory military service  which lasts up to 21 months  on wages and employment is minimal, anxieties about getting a later start than women in a hypercompetitive job market have also contributed to young South Korean men feeling that they are getting a raw deal.\n\nChun, the data journalist, points out that the mass entry of women into higher education also led to another tectonic shift being felt by the current crop of young men: the rapid collapse of traditional marriage dynamics.\n\nWomen have been doing the math and are increasingly concluding marriage is a net loss for them, he said. South Korea transformed from a society where marriage was universal into a marriage-is-optional one in an incredibly short time frame, especially compared to many Western countries where those changes played out over 60 or 70 years.\n\nIn 2000, just 19% of South Koreans between the ages of 30 and 34 were unmarried, but today that number is 56%, according to government data. Over a third of women between 25 and 49 years old now say they dont ever want to get married , compared with 13% of men, according to a government survey last year. One in 4 men will now remain unmarried in their 40s.\n\nSouth Korean women take part in a rally to mark International Womens Day in downtown Seoul on March 8, 2024. (Jung Yeon-je/ AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChun notes that the mismatch in the marriage landscape has bred in many the misogynistic resentment associated with incels, a term for men who identify as involuntarily celibate. A common refrain among young conservative men is the swearing-off of South Korean women, who are often cast as kimchi women  gold diggers who are unwilling to pull their weight while demanding too much of men.\n\nDo you need to only date Korean women just because youre Korean? No, said Chul Gu, an online personality popular among young men in a recent stream. There are Thai women, Russian women, women of all nationalities. There is no need to suffer the stress of dating a Korean kimchi woman. \n\nResentment toward South Korean women, Chun says, is inseparable from the generational animus that feeds it.\n\nIn the worldview of young South Korean men, they arent just fighting women, they are fighting the older generation that is siding with those women, he said. Its essentially an anti-establishment ethos.\n\nThe 586 generation, as they are commonly called, are South Koreans in their 50s or 60s who came of age during the high-growth, authoritarian period of the 1980s. Associated with the pro-democracy movements of the time, the 586 generation is one of the most liberal and pro-gender equality demographics in South Korea  and one whose members built much of their wealth through cheap real estate, an avenue no longer available for the majority of young South Koreans accustomed to seeing housing prices in Seoul double in as little as four years.\n\nYoung South Koreans are seeing those homes become worth millions, Chun said. Meanwhile, South Koreas birth rate is falling and life expectancy is rising to 80 or 90, so many young voters are thinking, Were going to have to be responsible for them for the next 40 to 50 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the candidates in last months presidential election, it was Lee Jun-seok , a 40-year-old third-party conservative candidate, who most aggressively targeted these tensions.\n\nDuring his campaign, Lee promised to segregate South Koreas fast-depleting national pension by age, a move he said would relieve younger South Koreans of the burden of subsidizing the older generations retirement.\n\nAlthough he finished with just 8% of the total vote, he won the largest share  37.2%  of the 20-something male vote, and 25.8% from men in their 30s.\n\nSouth Korea is very much locked into a two-party system where it is generally rare to see a third party candidate make much of a difference, said Kim Yeun-sook, the political scientist. I think theres a lot of negative polarization at play  an expression of defeatism or disenfranchisement at the fact that status quo politicians arent addressing young mens problems.\n\nData show that disillusionment with democracy too runs deep.\n\nAccording to a recent survey of 1,514 South Koreans by the East Asia Institute, a Seoul-based think tank, just 62.6% of South Korean men between the ages of 18 and 29 believe that democracy is the best political system  the lowest percentage in any age and gender group  with nearly a quarter believing that a dictatorship can sometimes be more preferable.\n\nWhether the rightward drift of young South Korean men is a temporary deviation or a more serious forecast for South Koreas democracy is still an open question, according to Kim Yeun-sook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now is the time to act, she said. There absolutely needs to be a political response to the younger generations frustrations.\n\n"

        "content": "Editors Note: Sign up for CNNs Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \n\nGobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018.\n\nOur study suggests poor carbohydrate quality is a leading driver of diet-attributable type 2 diabetes globally, says senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University and professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston, in a statement.\n\nAnother key factor: People are eating far too much red and processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, salami and the like, the study said. Those three factors  eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats  were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nIn fact, the study estimated 7 out of 10 cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide in 2018 were linked to poor food choices.\n\nUnhealthy carbs and processed meats are two leading contributing factors to global cases of diabetes, a new study said. djgunner/E+/Getty Images\n\nThese new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes, said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter.\n\nToo many processed foods\n\nMozaffarian and his team developed a research model of dietary intake between 1990 and 2018 and applied it to 184 countries. Compared with 1990, there were 8.6 million more cases of type 2 diabetes due to poor diet in 2018, the study found.\n\nResearchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents.\n\nOver 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice.\n\nInadequate intake of five protective dietary factors  fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and yogurt  was responsible for just over 39% of the new cases.\n\nPeople in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet.\n\nColombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.\n\nOur modeling approach does not prove causation, and our findings should be considered as estimates of risk, the authors wrote."

        "content": "Graphics: Where the Texas floods happened and how high the waters rose\n\nMost of the reported deaths in the July 4 floods occurred in Kerr County, Texas, along the Guadalupe River. Provisional flood gauge data from the U.S. Geological Survey, recorded at various points along the river, showed water levels spiking to record levels over the course of a few hours.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe flood gauge nearest Camp Mystic is about five miles downstream of the camp, where the South and North forks of the Guadalupe River merge. It recorded a rise of more than 25 feet in two hours, before going silent for the rest of the day.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe website for the National Water Prediction Service lists what might happen if a given flood gauge hits certain levels. For the Guadalupe River at Hunt flood gauge  the one downstream from Camp Mystic in the chart above  one might expect to see:\n\n\n\n\"Major flooding\" at camps along the South Fork of the river (an area that includes Camp Mystic) at 25 feet\n\n\"Disastrous life-threatening flooding\" at 32 feet\n\nThe area is known for being susceptible to flash flooding. Ana Campbell of Texas Public Radio reported:\n\nAs any Texan knows, the weather here is unpredictable. Thats because of the states unique position between cold, dry air from the north and moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico. Central Texas in particular is prone to intense rainstorms. Water fills the Colorado and Guadalupe rivers and their tributaries, making the area a popular destination for boaters and swimmers.\n\n\n\nBut when certain weather patterns collide like they did on Friday, the area is inundated with water that rushes through the hills and canyons. The abundant limestone keeps the water from soaking into the ground, so it rushes into the valleys, Sarah Spivey, a meteorologist with KSAT, told NPR."

He said that his unit was often ordered to shoot anyone entering areas deemed as no-go zones by the military.\n\nWe have a territory that we are in, and the commands are: Everyone that comes inside needs to die, Sky News quoted him as saying, referring to restricted areas, adding: If theyre inside, theyre dangerous, you need to kill them. No matter who it is.\n\nHe added that the criteria on whether to shoot often lay in the hands of the commander in charge. They might be shot, they might be captured, he told Sky News. It really depends on the day, the mood of the commander.\n\nNBC News has not spoken to the reservist and was not able to independently verify the soldiers account.\n\nAccording to Sky News, the reservist said his unit was stationed on the edge of a civilian area where soldiers slept in a house belonging to displaced Palestinians. Around their quarters was an invisible boundary, and civilians who crossed into this area were most often shot, he said.\n\nIn one of the houses that we had been in ... theres an imaginary line that they tell us all the Gazan people know it, and that they know they are not allowed to pass it, he said. But how can they know?\n\nThe soldier recalled several instances in which civilians were shot on the orders of the commanders, including once when the civilians were scavenging scrap metal and solar panels from a building near the Shujaiya area of Gaza City that was deemed a no-go zone. For sure, no terrorists there, Sky News quoted him as saying."

The court document says Abrego Garcia's treatment included \"severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia's lawyers shared the details about his treatment in CECOT in order to argue to a judge that he should not be deported to El Salvador, or any other country that could end up sending him there, \"without prior notice and opportunity to be heard.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe document describes how Abrego Garcia was stripped upon arrival at CECOT and \"kicked in the legs with boots and struck on his head and arms to make him change clothes faster.\" By the next day, \"he had visible bruises and lumps all over his body.\"\n\nThe detainees were held in overcrowded cells with metal bunks that did not have mattresses, and Abrego Garcia and 20 Salvadoran inmates were forced to kneel from approximately 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. \"with guards striking anyone who fell from exhaustion,\" according to the court filing. Abrego Garcia was denied bathroom breaks, and as a result, he soiled himself, the document says.\n\n\"While at CECOT, prison officials repeatedly told Plaintiff Abrego Garcia that they would transfer him to the cells containing gang members who, they assured him, would 'tear' him apart,\" the document says, continuing that Garcia \"repeatedly observed prisoners in nearby cells who he understood to be gang members violently harm each other with no intervention from guards or personnel.\"\n\nDuring his first two weeks at CECOT, the court document says Abrego Garcia's health deteriorated significantly, and his weight dropped to 184 pounds from roughly 215 pounds. Although journalists are typically not allowed access to CECOT, the human rights organization Cristosal and other advocates have accused authorities of abuses and overcrowding at CECOT and other Salvadoran prisons.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn April, Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen tried to visit Abrego Garcia at CECOT, but by then, he had been transferred to a different facility in El Salvador, the Centro Industrial prison facility in Santa Ana. The court document says that before the transfer occurred, Abrego Garcia and four others were taken to a different part of CECOT and \"photographed with mattresses and better food.\"\n\nIn a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said: \"Once again the media is falling all over themselves to defend Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\"\n\nMcLaughlin reiterated the administration's claim that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, a charge his family and attorneys strongly deny. She also reiterated the claim that he is a domestic abuser and added that the \"media's sympathetic narrative\" about Abrego Garcia \"has completely fallen apart, yet they continue to peddle his sob story.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed orders of protection against him in 2020 and 2021 alleging physical and verbal abuse, according to DHS. After those allegations surfaced, Vasquez said that she dropped the charges and the couple worked through their issues privately.\n\nNPR reached out to the embassy of El Salvador in Washington, D.C., but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\nAbrego Garcia was arrested in March by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and deported to El Salvador, despite a 2019 court order prohibiting his removal to the country due to fears of persecution.\n\nImmigration officials said his deportation order was an \"administrative error,\" but later accused him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang.\n\nThe Supreme Court in April ordered the administration to facilitate his return in order to give him proper due process in the U.S. About two months later, the Trump administration brought him back, but immediately detained him in Tennessee on federal charges of \"conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain\" and \"unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSince his return, a federal judge has ruled that Abrego Garcia is eligible for conditional release while awaiting trial. However, his attorneys have asked that he remain in jail over concerns that he could again be deported."

It has also been updated to clarify that attorney Gina Amato Lough serves as a directing attorney of Public Counsel.\n\nWhile its true that immigrant crime victims qualify for special benefits in some instances, the promise to get Gutierrez Aragon citizenship within three months at a discount dragged on for more than a decade. A housekeeper with a modest income, she was slowly bled for more than $100,000 through a mix of false assurances and threats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had to give him all my money instead of being able to buy my children what they need, she said between sobs in an interview. It was like torture. Every time the phone rang or every time a paper arrived for me, they were asking for more money.\n\nShe was a victim of so-called notario fraud, in which scammers acting as lawyers extract large sums from vulnerable immigrants.\n\nThe swindle is not a new one. But despite longstanding campaigns to raise awareness, advocates and law enforcement officials say they are concerned about a resurgence under the second Trump administration. Sweeps by federal agents and the deployment of troops to Los Angeles, they say, have created a climate of fear ripe for exploitation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hundreds caught up in the recent raids will be seeking affordable legal help as they fight to keep the lives they have built in the United States. Compounding matters, attorneys who specialize in immigration law say there is a shortage of qualified people working in the field. Unless separately appearing in state or federal court on criminal charges, people in civil immigration proceedings are typically not entitled to a court-appointed lawyer.\n\nCalifornia L.A. law enforcement leaders walk tightrope amid immigration crackdown The LAPD chief said in a department-wide message this week that some officers face conflicting feelings of loyalty, frustration, fear, or sometimes even shame as the community mistakenly views you as part of something that you are not.\n\nThe scam that bilked Gutierrez Aragon, a native of Mexico, hinges on confusion over what a notary public does in the U.S., and how it differs from Latin America and elsewhere, where notarios have far more legal standing.\n\nA notary public in the U.S. serves as an impartial witness when important documents are signed. But in other parts of the world, the term refers to an attorney with special credentials who has received the equivalent of a law license and who is authorized to represent others before the government, according to Victor D. Lopez, a professor of legal studies at Hofstra University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe type of fraud can vary. Some victims pay money to notarios who promise to represent them in hearings with immigration officials and never show up. Others see valid asylum claims end with deportation orders because the information submitted was false, bearing no resemblance to the harrowing experiences that forced them out of their home countries.\n\nIts the type of crime that preys upon the most needy and desperate people, Lopez said, adding that few places outside of Colorado have taken meaningful steps to crack down on immigration-related abuses.\n\nBecause of underreporting, he and others said, there is little reliable data on how many fraud victims there are each year. Many who have suffered losses are afraid to contact law enforcement because of their immigration status.\n\nGutierrez Aragon recounted in Spanish how she was duped by her notario, whom she and an attorney she found to help unravel the scheme identified as Fidel Marquez Cortes.\n\nIt started small, Gutierrez Aragon recalled: A few hundred dollars to process her fingerprints. Several hundred more for background checks. Trips to New York and Washington, D.C., which he claimed he needed to take to collect her passport. Each time, she gave him money to pay for the flight, hotel, rental car and gas, she said, but he always came back with an excuse for why he needed more time and cash.\n\nCalifornia How L.A. law enforcement got pulled into the fight over Trumps immigration crackdown The deployment of LAPD officers and L.A. County sheriffs deputies in response to protests over federal immigration actions has led to several viral incidents and raised questions about the role of local law enforcement in quelling the unrest.\n\nWhenever she pushed back, she claimed, Marquez Cortes warned that shed lose her chance at citizenship. She recalled how he would show her official-looking documents that he claimed were from a law firm in Orange County  all written in English and full of legal jargon she didnt understand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly later did she learn that he had created a fake letterhead for the law firm, and was using the money she gave him to pay for his back taxes, child support and even a speeding ticket, she said.\n\nEventually, in February 2011, Gutierrez Aragon found a lifeline in the Immigrants Rights Project at Public Counsel, a Los Angeles nonprofit that offers pro bono services for people seeking a path to citizenship or permanent residency. She came into their office terrified that it was her last day in the country, recalled Gina Amato Lough, who oversees the Immigrants Rights Project as a directing attorney at Public Counsel.\n\nShe was trembling, Lough said.\n\nHer new clients first words, Lough said, suggested she thought she was turning herself in to the authorities rather than seeking free legal counsel: I know that youre the immigration service and you have the power to deport me. But the day has come where I just have to know whats happened to my case.\n\nLough encouraged her to file a police report the following day at Olympic Division station. But an officer at the front desk turned her away, saying it wasnt a crime and that she needed to go to a courthouse to file a civil complaint. Lough accompanied her the following day and was told by another officer that they didnt take reports for such cases because its so common in L.A. that we couldnt possibly prosecute it.\n\nAfter Lough protested, police agreed to take a report and eventually, the man was charged with grand theft and convicted.\n\nDespite what Lough described as a lack of reputable immigration attorneys to help people through the labyrinthine U.S. immigration process, her group fought against a proposal by the state bar association to help bridge the justice gap by creating a paraprofessional classification, which would lower the bar to entry in the field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLough worried such a change would create more confusion and lead to more fraud. She called for local authorities to take seriously an issue that is often overlooked.\n\nMost district attorneys are reluctant to prosecute unless there are multiple cases and hundreds of dollars in losses, she said. There is a huge lack of enforcement within L.A. County.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis echoed that sentiment.\n\nSolis said she has fought for stronger regulations for a problem that isnt confined to the Latino community, pointing to recent cases in the county involving immigrants from Asian and European countries.\n\nHow do you deter the behavior if there is no teeth in the law? Solis asked.\n\nSome attorneys who practice immigration law say they are coming across scams that play out entirely online, allowing perpetrators to vanish before authorities even have a chance to investigate.\n\nLindsay Toczylowski, executive director of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said she recently had a client arrive saying they were expecting to collect a green card after sending money to someone they had been communicating with on WhatsApp.\n\nThe person on WhatsApp told the client they could pick up the proof of permanent residency status with Toczylowskis organization, which was a lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially that person was masquerading as a nonprofit organization, Toczylowski said, adding that her group is preparing a public service announcement to warn about the scam.\n\nOther times, immigration consultants arent out to defraud their clients, but still sometimes make promises that they cant keep, she said.\n\nToczylowskis center relies on local, state and federal funding, the latter of which has been threatened  a troubling development that comedian John Oliver highlighted on his show Last Week Tonight. After the episode aired, Toczylowski said the center received a flood of online donations, but not nearly enough to offset potential cuts to federal funding.\n\nThe center is also a plaintiff in an ongoing federal lawsuit out of Northern California against the Department of Human Services over slashed funding, she said.\n\nWhen the case involving Marquez Cortes, the man who defrauded Gutierrez Aragon, finally went to trial, he was found guilty and a superior court judge ordered him to pay three installments totaling $66,000 in restitution or face a two-year prison sentence.\n\nHe eventually fled to Mexico, where a bail bondsman tracked him down and he was arrested by local police, according to Lough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLough said she pushed for the man to be extradited back to the U.S. to serve out his sentence, but to this day shes not sure what his fate was. Gutierrez Aragon hasnt recovered her losses.\n\nShes never seen a dime, Lough said. And hes never spent not a day in jail."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Marine Le Pen is hoping the wave of populism sweeping the Western world carries her to the lyse Palace.\n\nThe wind of history has turned, Le Pen, who heads the far-right National Front (FN), told a crowd of supporters at the kickoff of her presidential bid earlier this month in Lyon, the industrial city in southeastern France. It will carry us to the summit.\n\nOpinion polls have shown Le Pen winning the first round of Frances presidential election in April, only to lose to whomever she faces in the second round of voting in May. That candidate will likely be Franois Fillon, the center-right candidate, or Emmanuel Macron, the independent; polls show the two men seesawing between second and third place in the first round. If no candidate achieves a majority in the first round, the top-two vote getters advance to a second round run-off. Although its still early, and polling can be wrong, the likelihood of Le Pen beating either Fillon or Macron in the second round is slim. Still, with the Western establishment reeling from Donald Trumps victory in the U.S. presidential election, the U.K.s decision to leave the European Union, and growing anger at political elites throughout Europe, Le Pen and other far-right, populist leaders in Europe fancy their chances.\n\nLe Pen envisions a France with closed borders, its own currency, and tough immigration controls; a country that is independent of international bodies like NATO, and one that ultimately puts itself first. This inward thinking, Le Pen reminded supporters, would not be unique to France.\n\nOther people have shown the way, she said, alluding to the Brexit vote last summer and Trumps election last November.\n\nAlthough such sentiments might be experiencing a resurgence, many of Le Pens policies are not new. Indeed, her 144-point manifesto outlining her vision for France reflects many of the policies the FN has put forward since it was founded more than four decades ago by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. From the onset, the party has opposed the European Union, economic protectionism, and same-sex marriage. It has also been characterized by anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and anti-Semitic sentiment (Jean-Marie Le Pen has repeatedly dismissed the Holocaust as a minor detail of history and defended collaborators of the Vichy government, which deported tens of thousands of French Jews to death camps during World War II).\n\nThose views havent earned the FN much electoral success. The party didnt win a single local election in 2015, and claims only two seats in French parliament. The FNs previous best performance in the presidential election was in 2002 when Jean-Marie Le Pen advanced to the second round for the first time in the FNs history; voters handed then-incumbent President Jacques Chirac 82 percent of the votean unprecedented victory that was widely regarded more as a rebuke of the FN than approval of Chirac. By the time Marine Le Pen took over as the leader of the FN in 2011, the party began a period of transformative rebrandingone which retained its far-right values with less emphasis on the homophobic, anti-Semitic elements. This ultimately resulted in the expulsion of the elder Le Pen from the party in 2015 in a family battle played out in the media.\n\nNational Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen delivers a speech next to his daughter, Marine Le Pen, in Britany, France on March 17, 2007. (Daniel Joubert / Reuters)\n\nVoluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries, Le Pen said of her father in November, adding: Today our adversaries no longer have that ammunition.\n\nStill, the younger Le Pens rebranding efforts alone may not be enough. Dr. David Lees, a researcher on French politics at Warwick University, told me last November that though Le Pens outsider status has certainly helped her anti-establishment image, it could also pose a challenge.\n\nThe FN has only got two members of the National Assembly in France  so if she does win, she wouldnt be able to form a government, Lees said. She would find it very hard to govern without having any sense of support in Parliament. She just wouldnt get anything through because the options of ruling by decree in France are very small for a president.\n\nIndeed, finding common ground with other members of the government would prove difficult for Le Penespecially in comparison to competitors like Macron, whose centrist, business-orientated agenda could be more appealing to swing votes on the left and right than the FNs populist agenda. Still, Le Pens rebranding has proven effective in communities previously marginalized by the FN. The party has actively pursued more progressive causes such as promoting womens rights and gay rights, as well as protecting Frances Jewish community from anti-Semitismoften by presenting Muslim immigration as a threat to all three.\n\nWe do not want to live under the rule or threat of Islamic fundamentalism, she told supporters in Lyon, and accused Muslim immigrants of looking to impose on us gender discrimination in public places, full body veils or not, prayer rooms in the workplace, prayers in the streets, huge mosques.\n\nThe FN has found common cause with far-right parties throughout Europe who share its anti-Islam and anti-globalist agenda, as well as other governments. Le Pen has praised both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that if she were elected, the three leaders would be good for world peace. Le Pen has been a vocal proponent of rapprochement with Russia. In addition to rejecting the notion of Russias actions in Ukraines Crimea as an invasion, she also condemned U.S. and EU sanctions on Moscow as completely stupid. The FN received an 11-million euro (about $11.6 million) loan from the Moscow-based First Czech Russian Bank in 2014, and Le Pen has reportedly asked Russia for another loan to finance her current presidential bid, citing French banks refusal to lend.\n\nFredrik Wesslau, the director of the Wider Europe Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me in January that Moscows ideological affinity with the FN is what attracts it to most of Europes far-right populist parties.\n\nThey see a country thats willing to stick up for socially conservative rights, thats embraced authoritarian populism, thats also xenophobic, in particular anti-Islam, which is something that many of these parties can relate to, Wesslau said. Theres a lot of overlap.\n\nAnd while the FN leader isnt the only French presidential candidate to support better relations with Russia (Fillon, the center-right candidate, has also supported reconciliation), reports of Russian media coverage favoring Le Pen against other contenders has sparked concerns Moscow might try to interfere in Frances elections similar to the way it did in the U.S. elections.\n\nBut for all the challenges Le Pen faces as an untested leader of historically fringe party, one that is often overlooked is her role as Frances sole female candidate. Women have historically been underrepresented in French politics, with female lawmakers making up 25 percent of the National Assembly and 27 percent of the Senate. dith Cresson became the first and only woman to serve as prime minister in 1991 under President Franois Mitterrand, but suffered low approval ratings and lost the post after less than a yeara loss some attribute to misogynist attitudes among the Socialist party elites. Socialist party member Sgolne Royal made French history in 2007 when she became the first woman to be nominated as a presidential candidate by a major party. She lost to Nicolas Sarkozy in the second round.\n\nIf Le Pen advances to the second round as polls suggest she could, shell only be the second female candidate to have done so since Royal. Its a glass ceiling Lees said she may have a difficult time shattering.\n\nWeve never had a female president, weve never had a female leader really in France, Lees said. So there really isnt precedent there.\n\nWith the first round of voting less than two months away, Le Pen has the task of maintaining the lead polls have given her since the start of the election. But it will also involve not being derailed by recent allegations she misused 300,000 euros of EU funds to pay her parliamentary assistants. Its a charge Le Pen denies, and one that has resulted in the arrest of her chief of staff, Catherine Griset, who has been charged with breach of trust. Le Pens lawyers say the investigation is an attempt to harm the presidential hopeful at the very moment when her candidacy is making a major breakthrough."

        "content": "CNN \n\nBuffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who has been cleared to resume football activities, said Tuesday his cardiac arrest during an NFL game in January was caused by commotio cordis.\n\nHamlin went into cardiac arrest after making a tackle and appearing to be hit with a helmet in his chest during the first quarter of the Bills game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.\n\nCommotio cordis can occur when severe trauma to the chest disrupts the hearts electrical charge and causes dangerous fibrillations.\n\nI died on national TV in front of the whole world, Hamlin said in his first session with reporters since the injury. I lost a bunch of people in my life. I know a bunch of people who lost people in their lives. I know that feeling. That right there is the biggest blessing of it all  for me to still have my people and my people to still have me.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been at the Bills practice facility in Orchard Park, New York, participating in voluntary offseason workouts this week, according to the team.\n\nHe is fully cleared, Bills General Manager Brandon Beane told reporters. Hes here.\n\nHamlin said he was blessed to have a wonderful medical staff who treat me with the care of their children.\n\nThe safety said his heart is still in the game and he was announcing his comeback to the NFL.\n\nI just want to show people that fear is a choice. You can keep going at something without having the answers and without knowing whats at the end of the tunnel, he said. You might feel anxious  you might feel any type of way  but you just keep putting that right foot in front of the left one and you keep going. I want to stand for that.\n\nBeane said that Hamlin had seen three separate specialists over the offseason, who all agreed that the player is clear to resume full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury.\n\n(Hamlins) in a great headspace to come back and make his return, Beane added.\n\nHamlin attends an event with lawmakers to introduce the Access to AEDs Act on March 29, 2023 in Washington, DC. The bill that would improve students' access to defibrillators in public and private elementary and secondary schools. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nBills head coach Sean McDermott said the team is happy that Hamlin is back.\n\nWere super excited for Damar. Hes moving forward one step at a time here. Hes been cleared from a physical standpoint, McDermott said.\n\nWell provide all of the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint so just happy for him that hes been able to check some of those boxes to this point and were moving forward taking it one day at a time.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, if no underlying cardiac abnormalities are discovered through testing, athletes who have been resuscitated from commotio cordis may return to playing.\n\nHamlin likely went through a lot of tests, including electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, before doctors cleared him to return to training.\n\nWhat it basically means a few things. One is that his heart function returned to normal. He has no underlying problems with the anatomy of the heart itself, and he has no underlying electrical problems, so thats the most important thing  and the way they figured that out over the last three-and-a-half months was to do a lot of tests, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on CNN News Central."

        "content": "A US coast guard rescue swimmer on his first rescue mission as well as teenage counselors who helped shepherd cold and wet young campers to safety have been credited with saving dozens of lives at a flood-ravaged Christian summer camp on the banks of Texass Guadalupe River.\n\nTheir stories of heroism and fortitude  including the counselors writing young campers names on their arms and legs with Sharpies so that authorities could identify them if necessary  are among the first to emerge recounting the grim reality of the torrent of water that surged Friday through the all-girls Camp Mystic, where at least 27 campers and counselors are known to have died.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, a further five campers and one counselor remained unaccounted for.\n\nCoast Guard petty officer Scott Ruskan, 26, of Oxford, New Jersey, spoke of plucking mud-covered children to safety after his helicopter crew flew through appalling weather to reach the campsite in rural Hunt early Friday afternoon.\n\nHe and his colleagues, he told the Washington Post, were greeted with scenes of devastation, and dozens of children, teenage camp counselors and staff desperate to escape.\n\nThats how quickly this floodwater rose, he told the newspaper in a phone interview. They didnt have time to grab shoes. Youre just carrying kids that dont have shoes on, theyre covered in mud, and youre trying to get them out of there.\n\nSome of it was simply talking to them and consoling them and trying to make them feel comfortable.\n\nRuskan, who joined the Coast Guard in 2021 and qualified as a rescue swimmer only last year, is credited with saving at least 165 lives during the three hours he spent on the ground triaging children and adults, and prioritizing the evacuation of the neediest cases, many on board Texas national guard black hawk helicopters.\n\nMany of the counselors, he said, were not much older than the young girls they were chaperoning  and they deserved credit for their role in saving lives. He said some told him of throwing children through windows and doorways to escape the fast-rising floodwater.\n\nIt was some really heroic stuff by those camp counselors, Ruskan said. I really hope they get the recognition they deserve.\n\nTwo Camp Mystic counselors, 19-year-olds Silvana Garza Valdez and Mara Paula Zrate from Mexico, spoke to the Mexican news network Televisa about the ordeal, which they said began at about 3am on Friday when electricity to the camp went out.\n\nBut it was not until about noon, they said, that counselors were informed that some areas of the sprawling 725-acre campsite had been flooded and survivors were gathered in a dining hall. The pair said the urgency of the situation was becoming clearer, and they began preparing girls in their care for what might be to come.\n\nWe began writing the girls names on their skin, wherever it could be visible, Zrate said.\n\nWe told them to make a bag with all their things, whatever was most necessary  to get ready to evacuate. But we didnt know if they were going to evacuate us or not, and so we waited.\n\nThey attempted to calm the frightened girls with songs and games as they watched furniture and other camp equipment washing by as the water rose higher.\n\nAll the girls started going crazy and crying because they didnt want to leave the camp  because they wanted to be with their parents, Garza Valdez said. It was a terrible situation. I dont know to explain it. It was something very awful.\n\nShe said she and those with her didnt initially realize others at the camp had died.\n\nWhat they spoke to us about at the time was that 25 girls were missing  and that two were found at a nearby campground alive and well.\n\nThey did not have their cellphones with them to be able to know more about the situation that was unfolding  or call their families  because the devices were kept in the camps front office, Garza Valdez said.\n\nTheir group was eventually rescued by a military team that arrived at the campsite at about the same time as the Coast Guard and national guard.\n\nI felt like I was in a dream  I didnt think it was true, Garza Valdez said.\n\nI dont think I understood the gravity of the situation until we saw it leaving on the army trucks. It was terrible. A week before, we were sleeping in the [hardest-hit cabins], and so simply it was difficult to process that they had moved and that we are alive because of that.\n\nRuskan spoke of the frustration of not being able to reach Camp Mystic immediately. He told the Post that early reports of flooding were received by 6.30am Friday, and his crew was in the air by 7am  but had to redirect to San Antonio because of zero visibility.\n\nThey finally landed in Hunt at 2.30pm, knocking over archery targets in a field from the helicopters downdraft as they descended.\n\nThe former financial consultant recalled that his trainers told him that his first rescue missions would be unlike anything they taught him to expect.\n\nThats kind of the point, he said. The expectation is that everyone is looking for someone to not be a hero, but kind of help them out and get them situated.\n\nThats what they needed me to be, and thats what kind of was in this case."

        "content": "Taylor Fritz survived a midmatch dip, a bold fightback from his opponent and even another linecalling malfunction as he beat Karen Khachanov 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) on Tuesday to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon for the first time.\n\nThe American coasted through the first two sets with some imperious serving, not facing a single break point, only to dip markedly in the third to allow Khachanov back into the match. However, after falling a break behind early in the fourth set, the No 5 seed rediscovered his focus and played a near flawless tie-break to advance to a clash with the defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nIts an amazing feeling, said Fritz, who hit 16 aces. Having played the quarter-finals here twice and lost in five [sets] twice, I dont think I could have taken another one. Im really happy Im going to get to play the semis here. Im feeling great to get through it. The match was going so well for me for two sets, Ive never really had a match just flip so quickly, so Im really happy how I came back in the fourth set and got it done. I think momentum was not going to be on my side in the fifth.\n\nAnother malfunction in the electronic line-calling system occurred at the start of the fourth set, when a forehand from Khachanov, which landed four feet inside the baseline, was called fault. The umpire, Louise Azemar-Engzell, stopped the point, got on the phone to reset the system and the point was replayed. Fritz ended up being broken as Khachanov moved ahead.\n\nHowever, the American broke back for 2-2 and from then on the two men raised the level and began to play outstanding tennis. The Russian held serve at 5-5 from 0-30, thanks to a brilliant lunging volley. Fritz was impregnable on serve again, though, and in the tie-break he began with a 138mph ace, hit two more and finished it off with a smash into the open court.\n\nFour years ago, after he lost against Alexander Zverev here in the third round, Fritz wrote a note on his girlfriends phone, saying: Nobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so good but 40 in the world, get your shit together. Now, he is in the top five, reached his first grand slam final at the US Open last year and is one match away from a first Wimbledon final.\n\nView image in fullscreen The chair umpire, Louise Azemar-Engzell, phones a friend after another malfunction in the electronic line-calling system. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nAt the time, my ranking was slipping, he said. I was coming back from a surgery and I felt like I was not playing to the level I felt like I should be playing. That note was never supposed to be public. I was ranting to my girlfriend about it, she said: Write it down, look at it. Im really happy with how Ive turned my career around over the last four years or so. Ive put in a lot of work and its good to see the results.\n\nStanding between Fritz and a first Wimbledon final is Alcaraz, who ended British interest with an impressive victory against Cameron Norrie. The pair have played each other twice, both on hard courts, with Alcaraz winning both times. The Spaniard has won the title in each of the past two years here but Fritz believes that if he can find his level, he has a fighting chance.\n\nIm happy that were not playing at the French Open on clay with the French Open balls because that would be an absolute nightmare, he said, laughing. I think grass is very much so an equaliser. So, trust in how Im playing. I truly know the way that I played the first two sets today, theres not much any opponent on the other side can do.\n\nAnd as an American, Fritz says he has already experienced the most pressure he is ever likely to face, when beating Frances Tiafoe to reach the US Open final last year.\n\nIts given me a lot of confidence in those moments and situations, just having been there, that I can do it again, Fritz said. Ive played the pressure matches. I dont think anythings going to get more stressful than me playing Frances in New York for a spot in the final."

        "content": "Search-and-rescue efforts continue in Texas after flooding leaves more than 100 dead\n\nCrews continue their search-and-rescue efforts in central Texas, four days after devastating flooding that left more than 100 people dead. Dozens are still missing.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nThe Texas Hill Country is reeling from the devastation caused by deadly floods.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe number of fatalities continues to increase four days after the overflowing Guadalupe River ravaged parts of the area. And residents are starting to ask whether this could have been prevented.\n\nFADEL: NPR's Sergio Martnez-Beltrn is in Kerrville, Texas, and joins us now. Hi, Sergio.\n\nSERGIO MARTNEZ-BELTRN, BYLINE: Hi, Leila.\n\nFADEL: So let's start with the latest. What do we know now about fatalities? It's gone up?\n\nMARTNEZ-BELTRN: Yeah, yeah. The latest news is very unfortunate. State authorities have said that at least 100 people have died as a result of the floods. But the vast majority of those fatalities are in one county here, Kerr County. The sheriff's office says 84 people were killed. This figure includes 56 adults and 28 children. Others remain missing. So truly devastating news here.\n\nFADEL: It's just so many children. Were most of them at that Christian summer camp, Camp Mystic, that sits along the river?\n\nMARTNEZ-BELTRN: Yeah, presumably. You know, local authorities did not provide a breakdown in their last update, which happened in the form of a social media post yesterday and different from the press conferences they had been holding twice a day. But Camp Mystic, which is the all-girls Christian summer camp along the Guadalupe River that you mentioned, has said that 27 campers and counselors were killed in the floods. I went up to the camp, Leila, and parts of it were swept away. And the areas around it were completely destroyed. And, you know, even people who survived the floods, like Paul Scherer, have mentioned how painful it is to see so many kids die.\n\nPAUL SCHERER: These kids that were there were like 7, 8, 9 and 10-year-olds. They had a big life ahead of them, and it's pitiful that this happened to them.\n\nMARTNEZ-BELTRN: Scherer is 74 and was living in a small apartment by the Guadalupe River. He had to evacuate in the early hours of Friday when the water was already about 4 feet tall in the parking lot. He lost his home, but he says he's lucky and that he's praying for the families of the girls who died.\n\nFADEL: And, Sergio, I mean, one of the big questions is about whether people were warned in time with enough notice to get out of the way of these flash floods. What are people telling you on the ground?\n\nMARTNEZ-BELTRN: Yeah, you know, almost all of the residents I've talked to in Kerr County say they did not get an alarm. Some got text messages, but they say it happened as the river was already on their steps. One of them told me he'd like the state to have an alarm system along the river. And this is something, you know, I've also heard from other folks. They want flood sirens or something like that. And politicians, Leila, seem to be listening. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told Fox News yesterday the state needs to step up and pay for an alarm system along the Guadalupe River.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDAN PATRICK: Had we had sirens along this area, up and down, the same type of sirens that they have in Israel when there's an attack coming, that would've blown very loudly, it's possible that that would've saved some of these lives.\n\nFADEL: Now, it's been four days of search and rescue. Is anything changing at this point?\n\nMARTNEZ-BELTRN: At this point, search and rescue operations continue. The governor has said it's a 24/7 operation. Yesterday, I was by the riverbank, and law enforcement agents were searching the area. And as the water volumes recede, you can clearly see the destruction in the area. So cleaning crews are now out in the streets, too, removing debris from the river and the roads.\n\nFADEL: That's NPR's Sergio Martnez-Beltrn in Kerrville, Texas. Thank you for your reporting.\n\nMARTNEZ-BELTRN: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "content": "Federal immigration agents detained renowned Mexican boxer Julio Csar Chvez Jr. on Wednesday outside his home in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nThe boxer was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in connection with \"an active arrest warrant in Mexico,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a news release Thursday.\n\nDHS alleges that the 39-year-old former WBC middleweight world champion is involved \"in organized crime and trafficking firearms, ammunition, and explosives.\"\n\nThe agency also said it believes Chvez is an affiliate of the Sinaloa Cartel, which President Donald Trump designated as foreign terrorist organization.\n\nChavezs attorney, Michael A. Goldstein, called the allegations outrageous and simply another headline to terrorize the community.\n\nChvez was being processed \"for expedited removal from the United States, the DHS said. Chvez is a Mexican citizen who has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for his involvement in organized crime and trafficking firearms, ammunition, and explosives.\n\nChvez claimed the middleweight title in June 2011 and defended the title three times. He was defeated Saturday at Honda Center in Anaheim, California, by influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul in a 10-round cruiserweight fight.\n\nChvez, the son of a former multidivision boxing champion, was born in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico. He made his debut as a professional boxer as a teenager in 2002.\n\nThe detention comes after weeks of federal immigration enforcement operations in the Los Angeles area after President Donald Trump made the issue a central part of his campaign.\n\nThe DHS said Chvez entered the country in August 2023 with a B2 tourist visa that was valid until 2024. He filed an application for Lawful Permanent Resident status last year based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen, whom the department also accused of having connections to the Sinaloa Cartel through a prior relationship with the now-deceased son of the infamous cartel leader Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.\n\nIn December, Citizenship and Immigration Services made a referral to ICE that Chvez is an egregious public safety threat, DHS said. In January, he was allowed to re-enter the country at the San Ysidro Port of Entry near San Diego.\n\nHe is accused of multiple fraudulent statements on the application for lawful permanent residence, according to the DHS, which deemed him removable from the United States on June 27.\n\nThis Sinaloa Cartel affiliate with an active arrest warrant for trafficking guns, ammunition, and explosives was arrested by ICE. It is shocking the previous administration flagged this criminal illegal alien as a public safety threat, but chose to not prioritize his removal and let him leave and come back into our country, said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. Under President Trump, no one is above the law  including world-famous athletes. Our message to any cartel affiliates in the U.S. is clear: We will find you and you will face consequences. The days of unchecked cartel violence are over."

A formal declaration would be announced after operations to clear any remaining sleeper cells and to remove landmines in the city were completed, Sello added.\n\nThe move is a major setback for the Islamic State which considered Raqqa the de-facto capital of its self-declared caliphate. It comes on the third anniversary of the global effort to defeat ISIS.\n\nRaqqa was the first provincial capital to fall from government control in March 2013 after it was captured by a rebel army. The army included both Syrian opposition groups and more hard line parties including al-Nusra and the Islamic State.\n\nA civilian government that was established in the city divided two months later, and less than a year later ISIS recaptured Raqqa and named the the capital of their caliphate.\n\nAbout 900 civilians have been killed since the the start of the five-month operation, including 570 people in coalition air raids, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the civilian death toll at 1,130 people. American journalist James Foley was beheaded in the mountains south of the city.\n\nSDF fighters pulled down the Islamic States black flag from the citys National Hospital near the citys stadium, according to a Reuters report.\n\nSpecial presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Brett McGurk said in August that the U.S. would attempt to perform a stabilization in Raqqa  including demining, removing rubble from major pathways to allow trucks and equipment through, and basic electricity, sewage, water, the basic essentials to allow populations to come back to their home.\n\nIt is not clear when the 300,000 civilians who have fled Raqqa since April during the operation will be able to return."

More than 580,000 refugees have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late August.\n\nWe really hold the military leadership accountable for whats happening, Tillerson said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Whats most important to us is that the world cant just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in that area.\n\nHe also called Wednesday for the U.S. and India to expand strategic ties. He pointedly criticized China, which he accused of challenging international norms needed for global stability.\n\nHe said the world needed the U.S. and India to have a strong partnership. The two nations share goals of security, free navigation, free trade and fighting terrorism in the Indo-Pacific, and serve as the eastern and western beacons for an international rules-based order which is increasingly under strain, he said.\n\nBoth India and China had benefited from that order, but Tillerson said India had done so while respecting rules and norms, while China had at times undermined them. To make his point, he alluded to Chinas island building and expansive territorial claims in seas where Beijing has long-running disputes with Southeast Asian neighbors.\n\nChinas provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for, Tillerson said.\n\nHe added that the U.S. seeks constructive relations with China but wont shrink from the challenges it poses when it subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries, and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.\n\nU.S.-India relations have generally prospered in the past decade, in part because of their shared concerns about the rise of China. While President Donald Trump has looked to deepen cooperation with China on addressing the nuclear threat from North Korea, hes also sought a closer relationship with India, which shares U.S. worries on Islamic extremism.\n\nIn this period of uncertainty and angst, India needs a reliable partner on the world stage. I want to make clear: with our shared values and vision for global stability, peace and prosperity, the United States is that partner, Tillerson said.\n\nTillerson said the U.S. wants to help improve Indias military capabilities, and also improve security cooperation among the regions major democracies, which included Japan and Australia.\n\nTillerson said the U.S. and India were leading regional efforts on counterterrorism. He called for Indias archrival Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based within their own borders that threaten its own people and the broader region."

They said the cross-dressing man, whose last name is Jiao, had been detained on Sunday on suspicion of spreading obscene material.\n\nBut police said Jiao was aged 38, not 60, as social media posts had stated. They also denied that he had intimate meetings with more than 1,000 men, but did not give a figure.\n\nJiao could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nIn China, homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997, but the dissemination of images of sexual acts is punishable by law.\n\nTaking pictures of sexual activities in a private setting and sharing them also violates privacy rights and could be deemed a criminal offense.\n\nMany social media users expressed public health concerns, with one Weibo user warning the incident could be a big headache for epidemic prevention authorities.\n\nSocial media users also circulated a montage of headshots of nearly 100 men supposed to have met the red uncle, prompting mock advice from some, urging women to check if their fiancs or husbands featured.\n\nThe invasion of personal privacy is a no-no, said one user, warning that it was irresponsible to publish such a compilation."

        "content": "The nations federal judges  including appointees of presidents of both parties, Donald Trumps among them  have been the bulwark against Trumps reign of lawlessness on deportations, spending, federal appointments and more. Repeatedly, lower courts have been standing up for the Constitution and federal law, trying to constrain a president contemptuous of both, at demonstrable danger to themselves. But too often, the administration disregards their orders.\n\nYoud think the Supreme Court  in particular Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the overseer of the judicial branch  would have the lower courts backs. But no, as the high courts conservative majority shamefully showed in a ruling on Monday.\n\nThat decision in one of many deportation challenges wasnt the courts first such display of deference to a president who doesnt reciprocate. And, safe bet, it wont be the last.\n\nThe court allowed the Trump administration to at least temporarily continue deporting migrants to countries not their own, unsafe ones at that, with little or no notice and no chance to legally argue that they could face torture or worse. No matter that lives are at stake  the justices blithely lifted an injunction by Judge Brian E. Murphy, of the U.S. District Court in Boston, that had blocked the administrations slapdash deportations while legal challenges wend through the courts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a blistering 19-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, marshaled legal arguments, damning examples of Trump administration dissembling and defiance of lower courts, and warnings of more defiance of federal courts from an emboldened president.\n\nIn contrast, the ruling from the Supreme Court majority was just one paragraph  unsigned legal mumbo-jumbo, its decision wholly unexplained, as is typical in the cases that the court takes all too frequently on an emergency basis, the aptly named shadow docket. (In two other shadow docket rulings in May, Trump was allowed to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Haitians, many of whom were here under programs created to protect refugees from violent, impoverished and repressive countries. Why? Who knows?)\n\nWhats all the more maddening about the Supreme Courts opacity in overriding both Judge Murphy and an appeals court that backed him is that its preliminary support for Trump in this case contradicts the plain language of the justices unanimous ruling in April that people subject to deportation are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.\n\nFire up the deportation planes, crowed a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department.\n\nSuch callous gloating surely didnt surprise Sotomayor. Her dissent began, In matters of life and death, it is best to proceed with caution. In this case, the Government took the opposite approach. And so did her conservative colleagues.\n\nAs Sotomayor wrote, historically the Supreme Court stays a lower court order only under extraordinary circumstances. Typically it doesnt grant relief when, as in this case, both district and appeals courts opposed it. And certainly it doesnt give the government a W when the record in the case, like this one, is replete with evidence of its misconduct, including openly flouting court orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamples: A judge agreed a Guatemalan gay man would face torture in his home country, yet the man was deported there anyway. The administration violated Judge Murphys order when it put six men on a plane to civil-war-torn South Sudan, which the U.S. considers so unsafe that only its most critical personnel remain there. And in a third case, a group was unlawfully bound to Libya before a federal judge was able to halt the flight.\n\nThus, Sotomayor said, the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration relief from an order it has repeatedly defied  an order that didnt prohibit deportations but only required due process in advance.\n\nAs she put it, the decision to stay the order was a gross abuse of the justices discretion. It undermines the rule of law as fully as the Trump administrations lawlessness, especially given that Americans look to the nations highest court as the last word on the law.\n\nThis is not the first time the Court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last, Sotomayor said. As if on cue, the Supreme Courts decision was followed on Tuesday by news that underscored just how dangerously misplaced the conservative justices deference toward Trump is.\n\nA former Justice Department official, who was fired for truthfully testifying in court that Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia had been wrongly deported to El Salvador, blew the whistle on his former colleagues  all Trump appointees  confirming in a 27-page document that theyd connived to defy court orders. Emil Bove, Trumps former defense lawyer and now his nominee for a federal appeals court seat, allegedly advised a group of DOJ lawyers in March to tell the courts f you if  when  they tried to stop Trumps deportations. Bove on Wednesday told the Senate he had no recollection of saying that; he might have denied it, as a DOJ associate did to the media, but Bove was under oath.\n\nAnd the alleged phrase captures the administrations attitude toward the judiciary, a coequal branch of government, though youd hardly know it by the justices kowtowing to the executive branch. The message, while more profane, matches Trumps own take on lower-court judges. The Judges are absolutely out of control, he posted in May. Hopefully, the Supreme Court of the United States will put an END to the quagmire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the sake of courageous judges who follow the law, and the rest of us, we can hope otherwise  even if the justices early record is mixed at best.\n\n@Jackiekcalmes @jackiecalmes.bsky.social @jkcalmes"

        "content": "New York CNN \n\nFew women will be surprised to learn that even when wives earn about the same as their husbands or more, a new Pew Research Center study finds that they still spend more time on housework and child care, while their husbands spend more time on paid work and leisure.\n\nEven as financial contributions have become more equal in marriages, the way couples divide their time between paid work and home life remains unbalanced, Pew noted.\n\nSo whos earning what?\n\nPew found that in 29% of heterosexual marriages today, women and men earn about the same (roughly $60,000 each). Husbands in egalitarian marriages spend about 3.5 hours more per week on leisure activities than wives do. Wives in these marriages spend roughly 2 hours more per week on caregiving than husbands do and about 2.5 hours more on housework, the study notes.\n\nIn 55% of opposite-sex marriages, men are the primary or sole breadwinners, earning a median of $96,000 to their wives $30,000.\n\nMeanwhile, in 16% of marriages the wives outearn their husbands as the primary (10%) or sole breadwinner (6%). In these marriages women earn a median of $88,000 to their husbands $35,000.\n\nOf all of these categories, the only one in which men are reported to spend more time caregiving than their wives is when the woman is the sole breadwinner. And the time spent per week on household chores in those marriages is split evenly between husbands and wives.\n\nIn all instances, its a big change from 50 years ago  when, for instance, husbands were the primary breadwinner in 85% of marriages.\n\nThese are the women most likely to be the biggest earner\n\nToday, which women are most likely to be the primary or sole breadwinners can vary by age, family status, education and race.\n\nFor instance, Pew found Black women are significantly more likely than other women to earn more than their husbands. For instance, 26% of Black women bring home more than their husbands, while only 17% of White women and 13% of Hispanic women do.\n\nBut Black women with a college degree or higher and few children at home are also among the most likely to earn about the same as their husbands.\n\nThese numbers are reported against a backdrop of societys attitudes about who should earn more and how caregiving should be divvied up between spouses.\n\nNearly half of Americans (48%) in Pews survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them.\n\nWhat do women want? Twenty-two percent of Americans said most women want a husband who earns more, while 26% said most would want a man who earns about the same.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. Only 19% said children are better off when their mother focuses more on home life and their father focuses more on his job.\n\nThe Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Is it too soon to start looking forward to the second presidential debate? Well, Donald Trump has yet to stop relitigating the first one, having spent most of Tuesday blaming his terrible Monday night performance by turns on moderator Lester Holt, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado and a debate commission that he suggested gave him a faulty microphone on purpose.\n\nBut while much of the post-debate commentary focused on how well Republican presidential nominee Trump and his rival Hillary Clinton performed under the bright lights of the debate stage, less attention was paid to the policies each one has been advocating. In Trumps case this is partly because he changes his policy preferences more often than most people change their underwear.\n\nDont like a Trump proposal? Wait 30 seconds, hell have another one.\n\nAs for Clinton, her reputation is that of a policy wonk who loves to dig deep into issues. Indeed, thats supposed to be one of the selling points of her candidacy. Campaign surrogates have often cited the thousands of words about policy on her website versus the few hundred on Trumps.\n\nOne area where she struggles is in connecting the importance of her policy solutions to their ability to materially affect disaffected voters who are unenthusiastic about voting for her. So some pointed questions on policy might help her in this area, if she can answer them without some of the stiltedness that she showed at times on Monday night.\n\nOf course, it is difficult to fit complex policy solutions into the two minutes allotted for answering questions. And any candidate will want to avoid going deep into the policy weeds and losing the audience. Still, there were some glaring omissions: The list of matters that got no airtime or at most a passing mention on Monday includes some of the most pressing issues we face.\n\nSo with the next debate scheduled for a week from this Sunday, here are a couple of topics that moderators Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC must ask the candidates about:\n\nClimate change\n\nPresident Barack Obama has said climate change is the most pressing foreign policy issue of our time. The competition of nations for resources that have been degraded and diminished by a warming planet is already leading to violent conflicts around the world. Indeed, there is some evidence that a drought driven by climate change has planted the seeds of the civil war in Syria that will be a foreign-policy priority for the next president.\n\nThe United States is a party to worldwide climate treaties that require it to do its part to reduce emissions. So whether a new administration would honor those treaties is an important matter for the rest of the world. Our military, which Trump keeps claiming he wants to rebuild, is already factoring climate change into its long-range plans. The GOP may still want to pretend the phenomenon is not happening, but that wont stop it.\n\nYet the only mention of climate change on Monday was when Clinton referenced a 2012 Trump tweet in which the real estate mogul accused the Chinese of inventing this hoax in order to destroy Americas economy. It deserves more attention than that  much more.\n\nHealth care\n\nObamacare still faces GOP-led resistance and continued efforts to kill it. This is causing problems for members of the public. Trumps plan is the same as it has been for over a year: Repeal Obamacare and replace it with something terrific. Clinton has signed onto the idea of a public option that would expand coverage and provide some competition for insurers.\n\nSeven years after the passage of Obamacare, the two parties still have a huge and unbridgeable philosophical gap on the right of Americans to have access to health insurance. A presidential debate is a good opportunity for the candidates to make clear to the voting public how their choice this fall will affect whether they have that access in the future.\n\nVoting rights\n\nThe Republican Party has been running a sustained effort to disenfranchise voters, particularly people of color, who generally vote Democratic. These efforts, which were ramped up after the conservative-dominated Supreme Court in 2013 gutted the Voting Rights Act, have been so egregious that federal courts have been furiously slapping them down. Yet some of the laws enacted by states for voter identification and other restrictions will keep thousands of people from voting this year.\n\nTrump, with his newfound concern for the African-American community, should be pressed hard on whether he agrees with the rest of the members of his party that it should keep as many black people from voting as possible. Clinton, meanwhile, could be asked about her announced plans for restoring voting rights and how much of a priority she intends to make restoring the franchise.\n\nFamily leave\n\nOne of the few topics on we have a specific plan from both candidates is family leave. Given Trumps history of sexism and misogyny along with his pride in having barely lifted a finger to help raise any of his children, this seems like a surefire topic that will get both candidates talking  and sparring. Serious issues can still make for great TV.\n\nThe moderators have until Oct. 9 to get their questions ready. Heres hoping they will address at least a few of the issues ignored in the first debate."

        "content": "Progress against H.I.V. marks one of the greatest accomplishments of biomedical research in history. Four decades ago, an H.I.V. infection meant an early, painful death. Scientists went on to develop powerful antiretroviral treatments that staved off AIDS and curbed H.I.V.s spread. Yet, in 2023, 1.3 million people around the world became infectedmore than thirty-five hundred per day, nearly a hundred and fifty every hour. Treatments only work if you take them, and many people do not know that they have H.I.V. Even for those who are aware of their status and can access the drugs, the virus integrates with human chromosomes and never clears, meaning that people living with H.I.V. must take medication for the rest of their lives. In 2023, almost forty million people were living with H.I.V., and six hundred and thirty thousand died from AIDS.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nThen, in June, 2024, Moupali Das, the head of H.I.V. prevention for the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, received an e-mail about lenacapavir, a drug being tested by the company to prevent the spread of H.I.V. The message authorized Das to see the results from an ongoing clinical trial in South Africa and Uganda. When she reviewed the data, at her companys sprawling campus in Foster City, California, she had to move closer to her computers screen to confirm that she was reading the numbers correctly. She was dumbstruck: What she thought was a zero really was a zero. More than two thousand teen girls and young women had been injected with the drug, which stays in the body for an astonishing six months. In the first year of the trial, each received two shots, and none of them became infected with H.I.V. It was phenomenal, Das told me. We thought it was going to work, but none of us thought it was going to be one hundred per cent. Three months later, the drug demonstrated ninety-six-per-cent efficacy in a similar trial that had enrolled more than three thousand men, transgender men and women, and nonbinary people who have sex with men.\n\nFor nearly twelve years, Gilead had been selling a pill named Truvada as a preventive treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. The drug worked remarkably well in clinical trials, but many healthy people had difficulty taking a daily pill, and others faced stigma and discrimination from sexual partners. Another company, ViiV Healthcare, brought a PrEP injection to market in 2021, but it only lasts two months, and remains little used. If two shots a year offered the same protection, Das knew, it could revolutionize H.I.V. prevention. On June 18th, the F.D.A. approved lenacapavir for PrEP. A stunning new era is upon us. But, as world leaders dismantle global health programs and cut back foreign aid, will this extraordinary new technology be able to change the world?\n\nWhen scientists first started talking about using drugs to prevent the spread of H.I.V., few expected that Gilead would be the company to develop them. In the early nineteen-nineties, the top anti-H.I.V. drugs on the market had at most a modest impact: they were reserved for people with severely damaged immune systems and, at best, only extended life by a few years. Side effects included diarrhea, nausea, headaches, and anemia. As the death toll approached a million per year, big pharmaceutical companies competed to create better treatments. Gilead, a small corporation that had a few hundred employees, was an underdog in the race. But it licensed a promising compound, tenofovir, from academics in Europe.\n\nDuring that bleak era, Che-Chung Tsai, a researcher at the University of Washington, contacted several companies, seeking experimental drugs for use in an animal study. Gilead sent him an early form of tenofovir, which produced remarkable results. When a group of monkeys were given the compound before being exposed to H.I.V.s simian cousin, S.I.V., not a single one was infected. Whats more, the drug had no significant adverse effects.\n\nH.I.V. is made up of single-stranded RNA rather than double-stranded DNA. To infect its host, it enters white blood cells, uses a viral enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA into DNA, and hijacks the cells machinery to make more copies of itself. Tenofovir works by crippling this enzyme. In a person with H.I.V., tenofovir prevents the virus from making new copies of itself.\n\nYet tenofovir also showed promise for people who did not have H.I.V. The monkey study found that, when a healthy animal received tenofovir, the virus was like a bullet that fell to the ground before striking its target: the RNA virus couldnt convert itself into DNA, so it couldnt splice itself into the DNA of the host.\n\nDespite the drugs potential as PrEP, Gilead made little effort to support the research: preventive drugs had unique risks. In uninfected people, its harder to prove that the benefits of a drug will outweigh potential risks, raising liability concerns. Some feared that widespread use of PrEP might breed resistant strains of the virus itself. And although millions of H.I.V.-positive people were desperate for effective drugs, it wasnt clear that people at the highest risk of infectiongay men, sex workers, people who injected drugs, sexually active heterosexuals in sub-Saharan African countrieswould want PrEP or be able to access it. And so Gilead focussed instead on the lucrative and stable market of H.I.V. treatments. In 2001, tenofovir won F.D.A. approval for treating H.I.V. infections. The next year, the drug accounted for about half of the companys sales.\n\nGileads disinterest in PrEP deeply frustrated academic researchers. In 2003, to confirm that tenofovir would work as well in humans as it had in monkeys, researchers announced plans to recruit sex workers for a clinical trial in Cambodia. Gilead kept itself at a distance from the study; the National Institutes of Health (N.I.H.) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation offered to fund the research. But some AIDS activists were enraged by the trials design. They argued that researchers were introducing risk of infection to people in a country with limited treatment resources. In July, 2004, at an international AIDS conference in Bangkok, a group descended on a Gilead Sciences booth and plastered it with posters: Sex Workers Infected by Gilead, Tenofovir Makes Me Vomit, and Gilead Prefers us HIV+. As news cameras from around the world gathered around the scene, the activists covered signs in fake blood. Soon after, the trials in Cambodia were abandoned. Though Gilead provided academic researchers use of the compound for PrEP studies, they declined to pursue further preventive testing on their own.\n\nA month after the Bangkok conference, the F.D.A. approved a new H.I.V. treatment, produced by Gilead, called Truvada, which combined tenofovir with a second drug. At the time, regimens typically required three drugs, several times a day. The new compound, a pill taken once a day, could be combined with just one other drug, simplifying treatment. By 2006, Truvada was the best-selling anti-H.I.V. drug on the market.\n\nFlush with cash, Gilead launched an ambitious project to create a new drug targeting an H.I.V. protein called capsid. Many scientists saw Gileads project as folly: viral proteins have no obvious weaknesses, making them far less druggable than viral enzymes. Researchers had long thought that capsid proteinswhich link together to form a protective shell, known as a cone, around the RNAsimply fell apart after infecting a cell. But a series of stunning discoveries found that the capsid cone not only survives infection but plays a far more complex role in the production of new viruses. With this insight, Gilead tested thousands of compounds, leading to the discovery, in 2012, of what would become lenacapavir.\n\nThat same year, Gilead finally sought F.D.A. approval for Truvada as PrEP. It was approved in July. A drug for prevention was a major turning point, yet it was met with ambivalence by some of the communities most affected by the virus. Even the primary market for the drug, gay men in the United States, had strong reservations about taking the pills to protect themselves. Critics feared it created incentives for uninfected men to abandon condoms and increase their number of sexual partners, undermining years of hard-won progress in prevention. Worries ran so high that some gay men for a time slagged people who used PrEP as Truvada whores.\n\nTruvada PrEP steadily gained popularity, and as it grew cheaper it became more widespread in poorer countries. In March, 2019, Gilead reported that lenacapavir had performed well in early human studies. Gileads risky investment was showing signs of paying offand this time, the company was eager to get ahead of its critics.\n\nIn December, 2019, Das flew to Kigali, Rwanda, to meet with community advocates and public-health leaders from across the continent. Lenacapavir was going to be tested as a prevention tool; the company wanted input on the design of the trials. How could the companys researchers avoid the community opposition that had dogged the Cambodia trial? Should they include pregnant people? What about adolescents as young as sixteen? Earlier research had been roundly criticized for excluding both groups, as well as for cutting out trans people and anyone taking hormones. Yvette Raphael, a human-rights activist who chairs the African Women Prevention Community Accountability Board, left the meeting reluctantly impressed. It was tough because, obviously, they are a pharmaceutical company, and we are advocates, Raphael said recently. Wed like to see more transparency from thembut they really have tried.\n\nThe company has also made efforts to increase access to preventive lenacapavir. After a drug is approved, years often pass before generic manufacturers are allowed to sell it at a discount. But in October, 2024, Gileadstill months away from even seeking F.D.A. approvalannounced that it had cut a deal with six generic manufacturers to provide low-cost versions of lenacapavir PrEP to a hundred and twenty poorer countries. While those producers are getting up and running, a process that may take an estimated two years, Gilead will sell lenacapavir to the same countries at cost. They learned from their mistakes, Mitchell Warren, the executive director of AVAC, an advocacy group for PrEP and other H.I.V.-prevention interventions, told me. At least conceptually, this is one of the most transformational moments in H.I.V. prevention ever.\n\nTwo months later, near the end of the Biden Administration, a major partnership set out to make injectable preventive lenacapavir available to at least two million people during its first three years on the market. It would bring together the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR; the deep-pocketed Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; the Gates Foundation; and the Childrens Investment Fund Foundation.\n\nThen came another seismic shift in the H.I.V./AIDS world. On the day President Donald Trump took office, his Administration began dismantling PEPFAR, which has spent more than a hundred and twenty billion dollars in more than fifty countries over the past two decadesnot only to support the treatment of twenty million people but also to purchase and deliver more than ninety per cent of PrEP drugs used globally. A State Department memo in February stated that, during this pause of U.S. Foreign Assistance or until further notice, PEPFAR could only support PrEP for pregnant and breast-feeding women.\n\nThe fate of the rollout of lenacapavir PrEP remains murky. Although neither the Gates Foundation nor the Global Fund has committed to honoring their original pledge, both have indicated that they still plan to support equitable access to lenacapavir PrEP. (What this means, in practice, is difficult to say.) The White House, earlier this month, released its Congressional Budget Justification for fiscal year 2026 that calls for continued support for PEPFAR, with a budget cut of thirty per cent and a desire to speed its elimination; it specifically mentions funding for high cost-efficiency biomedical tools, such as a twice-a-year HIV prevention injection.\n\nInjectable lenacapavir, despite its clear benefits, faces several other financial, political, and cultural challenges that have dogged PrEP from the outset. Will insurance companies reimburse for it in full? How aggressively will health officials promote its use? Will communities embrace it? We have not seen evidence of the bigger resources being devoted and the political will to do what needs to be done to get any of these PrEP options into the populations that need it the most, says Raphael Landovitz, an H.I.V./AIDS researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has helped run other PrEP studies. Everything we have seen is incremental. And so I fear that this is going to be yet another incremental improvement."

Hes an old Bush hand. I think he gave it his best shot. He is who he isnot a populist conservative.\n\nSean Moran of Breitbart had a similar take.\n\nVirginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespies loss to Ralph Northam represents a repudiation of the Republican establishment; Gillespie lost by more points than Donald Trump and Ken Cuccinelli, Moran wrote on Wednesday.\n\nOther conservative pundits have tried to paint the Republican disaster in Virginia as a question of demographics rather than anything specific about Trump.\n\nTuesday nights slaughter is more of a representation of Virginias rapidly changing demographics have made it a solid blue state  regardless of Trump, wrote Scott Greer of The Daily Caller.\n\nSimilarly, Doug Schoen of Fox News wrote that Virginia is now a seemingly reliable blue state, attributing Gillespies loss to the fact that minorities turned out in large numbers for Democratic candidate Ralph Northam. Schoen did acknowledge that to the extent President Trump was a factor in the election, he was a major negative to Gillespies candidacy.\n\nAmong Republican politicians, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan told an audience on Wednesday, It doesnt change my reading of the current moment.\n\nHe added, I fundamentally believe, when we deliver on comprehensive tax reform and tax relief . . . I think thats going to bear fruit politically, but most importantly its going to help people.\n\nSimilarly, a source close to Trumps political team told the conservative newspaper The Washington Examiner that both Gillespies loss and that of Kim Guadagno, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey, could be attributed to local dynamics and history.\n\nThese are blue states that the president did not win last year. This is not about the president, the source told the Examiner."

        "content": "Off the rails is how I would describe Donald Trump when he says he will be the protector of women.\n\nI woke up the other day and grabbed my cellphone to check my email where, courtesy of the internet, I had the pleasure of hearing the former president update me about the situation for American women. Now, early-morning Trump early is not exactly the dream scenario for most of us gals but what the hey. This particular morning, I learned that my current state of what I always thought of as moderate happiness was all an illusion, a cruel charade perpetrated by the fake news to make all of us ladies feel we were content with life under Joe Biden and the evil Kamala Harris.\n\nBut Trump enlightened me. Turns out I am less healthy, less safe on the streets, and poorer, paying more for all those cosmetics I smuggle in among the groceries so hubby doesnt see that I am spending too much on frivolous items. (As an aside, we gals have to buy lots of cosmetics to keep our looks, lest hubby trade us in for a younger model, as Trump did. But I extrapolate here. In fairness, Trump did not actually say that. Id characterize it as a nuanced trope underlying his overall message for us gals, except I dont have the education or the intellect to use words like trope.)\n\nBut I digress. Apparently, I am more stressed and depressed and unhappy and less confident in the future than I was four years ago. Gosh! All this enlightenment before I even get out of bed in the morning. Fortunately, help is on the way.\n\nI will fix all of that and fast. At long last, this nation, our national nightmare will end. Why? Because Trump will be our protector!\n\nGood old Donald Trump will make me safe at the border. (I assume he means the Mexican border, not the borders of my hometown, which the FBI happens to characterize as one of the safest in the country, partly because so many of its immigrant citizens are such exemplary citizens.) The good news is that Trump will not only ensure my border safety. He is going to make me and all the rest of my female posse safe on the sidewalks of [our] now violent cities in the suburbs which are under migrant criminal siege. Who knew?\n\nWe need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism\n\nThe even better news is that  true friend to women that he is  Trump is not content just to ensure my border safety. Nope. He is dealing with all those problematic emotional issues we gals wrestle with once we get our hair curlers out and put on our makeup and our six-inch heels so our fannies jiggle just right when we walk.\n\nDonald assures me I will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. I will no longer be in danger, will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today.\n\nHow? Trump will be my protector! Women will be happy, healthy, confident, and free. All we have to do is vote for him.\n\nWow! Im so relieved. And I hadnt even gotten out of bed that day. No need. I can just roll over and go back to sleep, secure in the knowledge that old Grab them by the pussy\" is on the job, taking care of me.\n\nThe man the jury said must pay E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million for sexual assault and defamation is taking time off from his numerous appeals and his presidential campaign to be my protector. The man who paid hush money to the adult film star Stormy Daniels and appointed the judges who overturned Roe v. Wade is going to take care of me. The man famous for his demeaning, derogatory, and just plain nasty comments about women, this man is going to be our protector, ladies. All we have to do is hop in our stilettos and hurry on down to vote for him, and we will be happy, healthy, confident, and free.\n\nSeriously?\n\nNow, Ive been thinking a lot recently about the moral courage of a few Republican leaders  women like Liz Cheney  who found the strength to stand up to Donald Trump. The former Republican congresswoman campaigned in Wisconsin, known as the birthplace of the Republican Party, with Harris on Wednesday. Three other Republican women, former Trump White House aides Cassidy Hutchinson, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Sarah Matthews, are set to campaign for Harris in Pennsylvania next week. I know not all Republicans, and certainly not all women, are stupid enough to fall for Trumps blatant lies about how he will treat women. We finally have a chance  an excellent chance  to elect a strong woman who, as president, will work to ensure equal treatment for women. Why would any woman want to return to the world of phony protection offered by Trump?\n\nIt's time for a woman president. Women can make a difference in this election by voting for Harris and giving Trump the message that he no longer needs to protect women. We can take care of ourselves just fine."

        "content": "CNN \n\nShares of Google-parent Alphabet fell more than 3% in early trading Monday after a report sparked concerns that its core search engine could lose market share to AI-powered rivals, including Microsofts Bing.\n\nLast month, Google employees learned that Samsung was weighing making Bing the default search engine on its devices instead of Googles search engine, prompting a panic inside the company, according to a report from the New York Times, citing internal messages and documents. (CNN has not reviewed the material.)\n\nIn an effort to address the heightened competition, Google is said to be developing a new AI-powered search engine called Project Magi, according to the Times. The company, which reportedly has about 160 people working on the project, aims to change the way results appear in Google Search and will include an AI chat tool available to answer questions. The project is expected to be unveiled to the public next month, according to the report.\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, Google spokesperson Lara Levin said the company has been using AI for years to improve the quality of our results and offer entirely new ways to search, including with a feature rolled out last year that lets users search by combining images and words.\n\nWeve done so in a responsible and helpful way that maintains the high bar we set for delivering quality information, Levin said. Not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as weve said before, were excited about bringing new AI-powered features to Search, and will share more details soon.\n\nSamsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogles search engine has dominated the market for two decades. But the viral success of ChatGPT, which can generate compelling written responses to user prompts, appeared to put Google on defense for the first time in years.\n\nIn March, Google began opening up access to Bard, its new AI chatbot tool that directly competes with ChatGPT and promises to help users outline and write essay drafts, plan a friends baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on whats in the fridge.\n\nAt an event in February, a Google executive also said the company will bring the magic of generative AI directly into its core search product and use artificial intelligence to pave the way for the next frontier of our information products.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has invested in and partnered with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to deploy similar technology in Bing and other productivity tools. Other tech companies, including Meta, Baidu and IBM, as well as a slew of startups, are racing to develop and deploy AI-powered tools.\n\nBut tech companies face risks in embracing this technology, which is known to make mistakes and hallucinate responses. Thats particularly true when it comes to search engines, a product that many use to find accurate and reliable information.\n\nGoogle was called out after a demo of Bard provided an inaccurate response to a question about a telescope. Shares of Googles parent company Alphabet fell 7.7% that day, wiping $100 billion off its market value.\n\nMicrosofts Bing AI demo was also called out for several errors, including an apparent failure to differentiate between the types of vacuums and even made up information about certain products.\n\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai stressed the need for companies to be responsible in each step along the way as they build and release AI tools.\n\nFor Google, he said, that means allowing time for user feedback and making sure the company can develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.\n\nHe also expressed his belief that these AI tools will ultimately have broad impacts on businesses, professions and society.\n\nThis is going to impact every product across every company and so thats, thats why I think its a very, very profound technology, he said. And so, we are just in early days."

        "content": "WASHINGTON  After her Army son died in an armored vehicle rollover in Syria in May, Sheila Murphy says, she got no call or letter from President Donald Trump, even as she waited months for his condolences, wrote to him to say some days I dont want to live, and still heard nothing.\n\nIn contrast, Trump called to comfort Eddie and Aldene Lee about 10 days after their Army son was killed in an explosion while on patrol in Iraq in April. Lovely young man, Trump said, according to Aldene. She thought that was a beautiful word to hear about her boy, lovely.\n\nLike presidents before him, Trump has made personal contact with some families of the fallen, not all. Whats different is that Trump, alone among them, has picked a political fight over whos done better to honor the war dead and their families.\n\nHe placed himself at the top of this pantheon, boasting Tuesday that I think Ive called every family of someone whos died while past presidents didnt place such calls.\n\nBut The Associated Press found relatives of two soldiers who died overseas during Trumps presidency who said they never received a call or a letter from him, as well as relatives of a third who did not get a call. And proof is plentiful that Barack Obama and George W. Bush  saddled with far more combat casualties than the roughly two dozen so far under Trump, took painstaking steps to write, call or meet bereaved military families.\n\nThe subject arose because nearly two weeks passed before Trump called the families of four U.S. soldiers who were killed in Niger nearly two weeks ago. He made the calls Tuesday.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump ignites furor with claim past presidents didnt console military families by phone\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Frederica Wilson said late Tuesday that Trump told the widow of a slain soldier that he knew what he signed up for. Early Wednesday, the president called Wilsons version of the conversation a fabrication.\n\nThe Florida Democrat said she was in the car with Myeshia Johnson on the way to Miami International Airport to meet the body of Johnsons husband, Sgt. La David Johnson, when Trump called. Wilson says she heard part of the conversation on speakerphone.\n\nWhen asked by Miami station WPLG if she indeed heard Trump say that she answered: Yeah, he said that. To me, that is something that you can say in a conversation, but you shouldnt say that to a grieving widow. She added: Thats so insensitive.\n\nTrump took strong issue with that recounting early Wednesday.\n\nDemocrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad! he said on Twitter.\n\nSgt. Johnson was among four servicemen killed in the Niger ambush.\n\nWilson said that she didnt hear the entire conversation and Myeshia Johnson told her she couldnt remember everything that was said.\n\nThe White House didnt immediately comment.\n\nREAD MORE: Trumps claim about predecessors, fallen troops disputed\n\nTrumps delay in publicly discussing the men lost at Niger did not appear to be extraordinary, judging from past examples, but his politicization of the matter is. He went so far Tuesday as to cite the death of chief of staff John Kellys son in Afghanistan to question whether Obama had properly honored the war dead.\n\nKelly was a Marine general under Obama when his Marine son Robert died in 2010. You could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama? Trump said on Fox News radio.\n\nDemocrats and some former government officials were livid, accusing Trump of inane cruelty and a sick game.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter was attacked, said: I just wish that this commander in chief would stop using Gold Star families as pawns in whatever sick game hes trying to play here.\n\nFor their part, Gold Star families, which have lost members in wartime, told AP of acts of intimate kindness from Obama and Bush when those commanders in chief consoled them.\n\nTrump initially claimed that only he among presidents made sure to call families. Obama may have done so on occasion, he said, but other presidents did not call.\n\nHe equivocated Tuesday as the record made plain that his characterization was false. I dont know, he said of past calls. But he said his own practice was to call all families of the war dead.\n\nBut that hasnt happened:\n\nNo White House protocol demands that presidents speak or meet with the families of Americans killed in action  an impossible task in a wars bloodiest stages. But they often do.\n\nAltogether some 6,900 Americans have been killed in overseas wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the overwhelming majority under Bush and Obama.\n\nDespite the much heavier toll on his watch  more than 800 dead each year from 2004 through 2007  Bush wrote to all bereaved military families and met or spoke with hundreds if not thousands, said his spokesman, Freddy Ford.\n\nVeterans groups said they had no quarrel with how presidents have recognized the fallen or their families.\n\nI dont think there is any president I know of who hasnt called families, said Rick Weidman, co-founder and executive director of Vietnam Veterans of America. President Obama called often and President Bush called often. They also made regular visits to Walter Reed and Bethesda Medical Center, going in the evenings and on Saturdays.\n\n___\n\nBynum reported from Savannah, Georgia.

        "bias": "",
        "content": "It makes so much sense to refer to certain kinds of celebrities as stars. At their heights, those people inspire the rest of us. They shine, larger than life, above us, and around us. They suggest, in their insistent omnipresence, a certain order to the world. To see the starsor, more specifically, to believe in them, taxonomicallyis to endorse a notion that the people before us on our screens, far from us and yet so close, exist, as the author Jeanine Basinger puts it, on some plane between ours and that of the gods.\n\nBut: Why are they stars, specifically? Why is Hollywoods Walk of Fame populated by pentagrams of pale pink, rather than some other arbitrary shape? Why is it stars who are, obviously and incorrectly, Just Like Us?\n\nThe answer has to do with Ovid. And Shakespeare. And Thomas Edison. And Mary Pickford. Stars are stars, certainly, because they sparkle and shinebecause, even when they are bathed in the limelight, they seem to have an incandescence of their own. But they are stars, much more specifically, because they are part of Western cultures longstanding tendency to associate the human with the heavenly. They are stars because their audiences want themand in some sense need themto be.\n\nThe broad use of the word star to indicate a leader among us dates back, Peter Davis, a theater historian at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told me, to the Middle Ages. Chaucer, who was also the first recorded user of the word celebrity and one of the first to use the word famous, also hinted at the lexical convergence of the human and the celestial: In The House of Fame, Chaucers dreamer worries that he might find himself stellified. O God Who made nature, the dreamer thinks, am I to die in no other way? Will Jove transform me into a star?\n\nChaucer, Dean Swinford points out in his book Through the Daemons Gate, was recalling Ovids notion of metamorphosisthe idea that humans could be transformed, in this case, into the shiny stuff of constellations. Chaucers words also carried architectural implications that would likely have been apparent to his audiences: Fixing with stars, Swinford points out, implies the creation of a mosaic-like decoration of the interior of a cathedral. The building was an intentional mimicry of the sky, and an unintentional anticipation of Hollywoods own kind of firmament: It presented stars as a constellation of gleaming lights, always above.\n\nIt was through the wily dynamics of public relations that star, in the United States, was born.\n\nThe US Weeklyfied version of stellification is in many ways a direct descendant of Chaucers: It emphasizes the role of the celebrity as a body both distant and accessible, gleaming and sparkling and yet reassuringly omnipresent. Stars have long suggested a kind of orderand orientationwithin chaotic human lives. They have long hinted that there is something bigger, something beyond, something more.\n\nLittle surprise, then, thatespecially as the world of science became more familiar with the workings of celestial bodiesthe world of the theater seized on their symbolism. Molire, Peter Davis told me, made Chaucerian use of the personified star: In School for Wives, in 1662, Horace describes Agnes as this young star of love, adorned by so many charms. Shakespeare, too, neatly anticipated Hollywoods blending of the personal and the celestial in both his plays and his poems. We make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and stars, Edmund laments in King Lear, as if we were villains on necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion. Love, too, in Shakespeares mind, makes its highest sense as a heavenly force, reassuring in its constancy: In Sonnet 116, the bard finds love to be ...an ever-fixed mark / That looks on tempests and is never shaken; / It is the star to every wandring bark, / Whose worths unknown, although his height be taken.\n\nIt was in this context, Davis explains, that the notion of the human star came to refer, in particular, to the decidedly grounded firmament of the theaterand to the decidedly human person of the actor. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first reference to a star of the stage came in 1751, with the Bays in Council announcing, You may Shine the brightest Theatric Star, that ever enlivend of charmd an Audience. Around the same time, in 1761, the book Historical Theatres of London & Dublin noted of an apparently Meryl Streepian actor named Garrick: That Luminary soon after became a Star of the first Magnitude. Garrick would appear again in 1765, in an extremely effusive article written about him in The Gentlemans and London Magazine: The rumor of this bright star appearing in the East flew with the rapidity of lightening through the town, and drew all the theatrical Magi thither to pay their devotions to his new-born son of genius.\n\nBy the 1820s, it was common to refer to actors as starsfor purposes of salesmanship as much as anything else. Theater touring became popular during that time, in both England and America. British actors, in particular, Davis told me, were often promoted as stars for their tours in the U.S. as a way to ensure that large audiences would come to witness their performances. Actors like Edmund Kean, George Frederick Cooke, and Charles and Fanny Kemble were celestially sold to American audiences. Sometimes, Davis notes, the actors were considered to have passed their prime in Britain; they used their American tours to reboot their careers back home. It was fitting: Through the wily dynamics of public relations, star, in the U.S., was born.\n\nThe term carried through as theater acting gave way to movie actingas silent films gave way to talkies. The observable glow of potential stardom was present from the very beginning of film history, Jeanine Basinger notes in her book The Star Machine. But it also took hold, as with so much else in Hollywood history, fitfully. As Jan-Christopher Horak, the director of the UCLA Film and Television Archive, told me, the earliest films didnt name the actors who starred in them. That was in part because the actors, many of whom had been trained in the theater, were initially embarrassed to be putting their hard-won skills to the service of this strange new medium.\n\nThe earliest films didnt bother to name the actors who starred in them.\n\nIt was also, however, because of the mechanics of the medium itself. On film, Anne Helen Petersen suggests in her book Scandals of Classic Hollywood: Sex, Deviance, and Drama From the Golden Age of American Cinema, the Hollywood star was a function of technology as much as it was one of culture. As early cinema developed in the early 20th century, bulky and unwieldy cameras made it difficult for cinematographers to capture anything beyond full-length shots of actors. Because viewers couldnt see the actors face up close, Petersen writes, it was difficult to develop the feelings of admiration or affection we associate with film stars. As cameras improved, though, close-ups became more common, emphasizing actors faces and humanity. As sound became part of the cinema experience, voices, too, substituted full personas for lurching images. The picture personality had arrived. The star, yet again, was born.\n\nWith that came the star system that would give structure to Hollywood for much of its young life. Mary Pickford, Horak notes, one of the first movie actors to be billed under her (stage) name, soon began making films under her own banner. Charlie Chaplin, long before Andy Warhol would ironize the term, became a superstar. The star itself, in the era of spotlights and marquis banners, soon became a metonyma convenient and fitting way to describe the people who studded Hollywoods new and expanding firmament. The term that had taken life in the age of Shakespeare and Molire and early romanticisma time that would, in some places, find art becoming obsessed with the dignity of the individual and the fiery workings of the human soulcame alive yet again in the glow of the screen.\n\nIt may be quaint, today, to talk of movie stars. This is an age defined, after all, by that other Chaucerian term: the celebrity. Its an age of actor-founded lifestyle brands and internet-famous felines and people starring in reality itself. But our current celebrities, too, suggest something similar to what star has long evoked: orientation, transcendence, a kind of union between mortals and the gods they have chosen for themselves. Celebrity comes from the Old French for rite or ceremony; it suggests that even the most frivolous of the famous are filling a role that is, in its way, profound. Starsfusions of person and persona, of the fleshy human and the flinty image on the stage and screenhave long offered a kind of structure within the hectic hum of human lives. They have long promised that most basic and inspiring of things: that we can be something more than what we are. I am big, Norma Desmond, that fading star, insisted. Its the pictures that got small."

        "content": "The US House of Representatives passed Donald Trumps sweeping tax and spending bill on Thursday, handing the president the first major legislative victory of his second term and sending to his desk wide-ranging legislation expected to supercharge immigration enforcement and slash federal safety net programs.\n\nThe 218-214 vote came after weeks of wrangling over the measure that Trump demanded be ready for his signature by Friday, the Independence Day holiday. Written by his Republican allies in Congress and unanimously rejected by Democrats, the bill traveled an uncertain road to passage that saw multiple all-night votes in the House and Senate and negotiations that lasted until the final hours before passage. Ultimately, Republicans who had objected to its cost and contents folded, and the bill passed with just two GOP defections: Thomas Massie, a rightwing Kentucky lawmaker, and Brian Fitzpatrick, who represents a Pennsylvania district that voted for Kamala Harris in last years election.\n\nWeve waited long enough, some of us have literally been up for days now, but this day  this day  is a hugely important one in the history of our nation, the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, said, just before voting began.\n\nWith one big, beautiful bill, we are going to make this country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before, and every American is going to benefit from that.\n\nThe legislation is expected to speed up and expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations, and will probably make Trumps longstanding desire for a wall along the border with Mexico a reality.\n\nIt also strikes a blow against the US governments efforts to fight the climate crisis by phasing out tax incentives created under Joe Biden that were intended to spur investments in electric cars, wind and solar power and other green energy technologies.\n\nThe bills centerpiece is a permanent extension of tax cuts made in 2017, during Trumps first term, as well as the creation of new, temporary exemptions for tips, overtime pay and car loan interest that the president promised voters during last years campaign.\n\nThe government will lose trillions of dollars in revenue from those provisions, and to offset their costs, Republicans approved an array of cuts to Medicaid, the federal program providing health insurance coverage to poor and disabled Americans, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).\n\nThose changes are expected to cost millions of people their benefits, but the bill remains expensive, with the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) saying it will add $3.3tn to the countrys debt through 2034.\n\nMassie explained his decision to vote against the bill in a post on X, writing that it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates.\n\nFitzpatrick issued a statement saying it was the Senates amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for his district and made him vote no.\n\nDemocrats blasted the proposal as one big, ugly bill that dismantles anti-poverty programs to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. Analyses have shown that high earners benefited most from Trumps tax policies.\n\nThe Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, made a last-ditch effort to halt the bills passage by delivering a floor speech that lasted eight hours and 44 minutes, the longest ever.\n\nThis is extraordinary. This assault on everyday Americans, assault on children, veterans, seniors, people with disabilities. Its incredible to me, all of this in this one, big, ugly bill, Jeffries said.\n\nRipping food out of the mouths of vulnerable Americans  thats extraordinary that thats what were doing, extraordinary. And all of this is being done, this unprecedented assault on everyday Americans, is being unleashed on the American people, Mr Speaker, on the most vulnerable among us, all of this is being done to provide massive tax breaks to billionaire donors. Shame on this institution. If this bill passes, thats not America. Were better than this.\n\nTrump has described the bill as crucial to the success of his second term, and congressional Republicans made its passage their top priority. It was a tall task  the GOP won small majorities in both the House and Senate in last Novembers election, and could afford no more than three defections in either chamber.\n\nThe partys lawmakers broadly support Trump but were divided on a host of other issues. There were lawmakers who wanted big spending cuts, rapid phase-outs of green energy incentives and an expanded deduction that would mostly benefit taxpayers in Democratic-led states. Their demands butted against others who sought to moderate the bill, but over the course of weeks, Republicans leaders managed to forge a compromise.\n\nThe bill is only able to affect revenue, spending and the debt limit, under the rules of budget reconciliation that allowed the GOP to avoid a filibuster by Democrats in the Senate. Under Biden, Congresss then Democratic majority had used the same procedure to pass legislation to spur the economys recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and curb US carbon emissions.\n\nTrumps bill allocates $45bn for Ice detention facilities, $14bn for deportation operations and billions of dollars more to hire 10,000 new agents by 2029. An additional $50bn will go towards the border wall and other fortifications.\n\nEnrollees of Medicaid and Snap will face new work requirements, and states will be forced to share part of the cost of the latter program for the first time ever. The CBO estimates the bills Medicaid changes could cost as many as 11.8 million people their healthcare, and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities forecasts about 8 million people, or one in five recipients, may lose their Snap benefits.\n\nThe legislation also forces changes to provider taxes, which states use to finance their share of Medicaid spending. That is expected to further increase the financial stress of hospitals in rural areas, and when the bill was in the Senate, a $50bn fund was added to support those facilities.\n\nSome in the GOP were openly nervous about the cuts to safety net programs that their constituents rely on. Thom Tillis, a senator who represents swing state North Carolina, refused to support the bill for those reasons, leading Trump to announce he would support a primary challenger when he stands for re-election next year. Tillis then made public his plans to retire, a potential boost for Democrats hopes of claiming his seat.\n\nIt is inescapable this bill will betray the promise Donald Trump made, Tillis said on the Senate floor.\n\nWhat do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the fundings not there any more, guys?"

        "content": "A 61-year-old San Antonio man pleaded guilty to two federal charges in the human smuggling incident that led to the deaths of 10 undocumented immigrants this summer.\n\nJames Matthew Bradley Jr., who appeared before a U.S. magistrate judge Monday, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to transport aliens resulting in death and one count of transporting aliens resulting in death, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Texas.\n\nThe office added that Bradleys admission of guilt meant he packed dozens of unauthorized immigrants into a tractor-trailer for financial gain, adding that the suspect confirmed that details from court documents were factually correct.\n\nOn July 23, San Antonio Police Department officers responded to a call from a Walmart employee shortly past midnight. Once officers arrived, they found 39 immigrants at the scene. Of those carried in the tractor-trailer, eight were found dead in the rear of the trailer, while two died later at nearby hospitals, the statement said.\n\nSurvivors of the incident said there was no air conditioning in the overheated trailer and had to take turns to breath through a hole in the back of the truck for air. Bradley also initially told investigators that he was unaware of the immigrants in the trailer until he had stopped at the Walmart in San Antonio for bathroom break.\n\nThe attorneys office also said Bradley faces up to life in prison with the charges and that he is scheduled to be sentenced in January 2018. Immigrants said there were up to 200 people transported on the trailer and that different fees were quoted to them for the ride north from the U.S.-Mexico border, the statement added.\n\nJason Buch of San Antonio Express-News told the NewsHour earlier this year that Border Patrol agents in Laredo, Texas, reported an uptick of immigrants using tractor-trailers to get pass checkpoints at the border.\n\nPeople are usually going on to major metropolitan areas or regions of the country that employ a lot of immigrant laborers, so, areas with large agriculture industries or construction booms, Buch said.\n\nShane M. Folden, special agent in charge of homeland security investigations in San Antonio, said in the statement that the proceeding helps to close the door on one of the conspirators responsible for causing the tragic loss of life and wreaking havoc on those who survived this horrific incident.\n\nThis case is a glaring reminder that alien smugglers are driven by greed and have little regard for the health and well-being of their human cargo, which can prove to be a deadly combination, he added.\n\nBradleys co-defendant Pedro Silva Segura was also indicted last month with faces two counts of conspiracy and two counts of transporting undocumented immigrants resulting in serious bodily injury and placing lives in jeopardy.\n\nSegura, 47, is an undocumented immigrant who resides in Laredo, Texas."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "On Monday night, forty-eight hours after President Donald Trump ordered a series of strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, he announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Earlier that day, Iran had fired missiles at an American airbase in Qatar, an attack that came with advance warning and resulted in no casualties. The Trump Administration had initially signalled a reluctance to formally get involved in Israels campaign to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, but, since the strikes on Saturday, Trump had publicly mused about the possibility of regime change. Even after his Monday announcement that hed helped broker a pause in hostilities, Iran and Israel continued to exchange missile attacks, each side accusing the other of breaking the terms of the ceasefire. On Tuesday morning, Trump told reporters at the White House, We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they dont know what the fuck theyre doing.\n\nNicole Grajewski is a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peaces Nuclear Policy Program, and the author of the book Russia and Iran. (On Monday, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met in Moscow with his countrys most powerful ally, Vladimir Putin, who had criticized the American strike.) Grajewski and I spoke just prior to the ceasefire announcement, and followed up after Trumps declaration. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below. In it, we discuss why a ceasefire may be difficult to sustain, what Russias relationships with both Iran and Israel may portend for the region, and why a war meant to end Irans nuclear program may instead have delivered prolonged uncertainty.\n\nWhat are your concerns about a ceasefire holding in the short, medium, and long term?\n\nIn the short term, I think my primary concern is accidental escalation. Whether thats Iranian proxy groups in Iraq launching something against Israel and Israel responding, or because of a response to statements from Israel or Iran. In the medium to long term, my concern has to do with the acrimonious relationship between Iran and Israel which would likely continue. This ceasefire is not going to eradicate years of shadow war that Iran and Israel are locked into. And the nuclear issue continues to loom.\n\nHow so?\n\nOn Monday, the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Iranian parliament approved an outline of a bill that would suspend Irans coperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. That would curtail efforts at identifying, or at least accounting for, Irans stockpile of highly enriched uranium and access to these nuclear sites. So there may be momentum within Iran that seems to be pushing against international oversight on its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu has also been very aggressive latelycould you see him giving Trump a victory on a short-term ceasefire, as he did with Gaza, and then wanting to re-start the war?\n\nIts very foreseeable that Israel takes the opportunity again to go in and eliminate certain facilities or leadership. I think a lot of the escalatory dynamics probably hinge on what is left of the Iranian nuclear program and how close they are to reconstituting. Some of the uranium metal facilities have been destroyed, so thats actually a pretty good stopgap for some of the weaponization work. But we dont know where the highly enriched uranium that Iran had is. And then Iran has a lot of components of centrifuges, and these havent been under I.A.E.A. inspection since 2021. So, on the long-term side of it, you could see Iran developing a covert program. Moreover, because you did see Israel assassinating Iranian scientists in the past, Iran created a pretty robust community of nuclear scientists, nuclear engineers, nuclear physicists, so that continuity of knowledge would be maintained. So its not like the knowledge is eradicated either. And I think one thing thats going to happen as a result of the mass intelligence penetration that really curtailed Irans military response and led to this destruction of their Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (I.R.G.C.) leadership, is that theres going to be a higher-surveillance state, a higher clampdown at a societal level, and, I think, a far more secretive program.\n\nWhat internal and external dynamics do you see within Iran right now?\n\nThere is a domestic audience to whom the Iranian leadership wants to convey a semblance of stability and a semblance of strength. But this is also about signalling to the United States that Iran is not weak and that, despite these massive hits when it comes to their military facilities, when it comes to their conventional power they still reserve a right to respond. But it seems that there was some warning or signalling to America and/or Qatar before this Qatar military-base attack. Iran likely doesnt want to get involved in a war of attrition with the United States, even if they are preparing for one.\n\nSo the signalling is just to make clear that a prolonged war is not what Iran wants?\n\nYeah, and theres obviously now this concern about regime change and internal stability. And so thats going to be something, I think, that Iranian strategists are thinking about as well, because the continuation of this war for them also increases their vulnerability when it comes to the kind of control that they have at home. Israel on Monday targeted some of the organs of repression within Iran, such as the so-called Basij force, for example, and other parts of their internal security services.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about how the regime is structured and operates?\n\nThe regime functions on repression, and terror to an extent. Thats how it was formed in this revolutionary context and then after the Iran-Iraq War. But its heavily bureaucratized and also institutionalized. And the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is one aspect of this. And one part of that is the Basij, which is their internal clamp on power. But they also have major conglomerates of economic interests that are really predicated on corruption. And it is factionalized. There are certain factions where you have the clergy and that emphasis in just certain parts of the country. So in Qom, for example, thats a pretty large concentration of power when it comes to the clergy. And so you see that in discussions of the Guardian Council, which oversees elections and approves legislation, or even with succession talk. But then theres also these hard-liners who are very much entrenched in this ideology of confrontation with the United States and Israel. And this also includes a very strong emphasis on maintaining at least this kind of threshold nuclear status and also projecting its power throughout the region.\n\nSo Iran functions as somewhat of a kleptocracy, but also a heavily ideological one. And, of course, this is all driven by an acute sense of vulnerability to any kind of internal or external upheaval that might threaten the very existence of the regime. And, of course, theres a Supreme Leader, and he is the ultimate arbitrator within Iran, but theres a cadre of lites around him.\n\nI have seen you warn about the consequences of regime change. What about this regimes structure that you have just broadly defined makes you concerned specifically?\n\nOne problem with the discussion of Iranian regime change in the United States is that its a goal within itself, but there is nothing with what happens after. The experience of Iraq is a good example of this. But with Iran, I think whats worrisome is that there are such strong and also militarized factions that could potentially mount somewhat of a countercoup. The Iranian people mostly dont support the current regime, and many Iranian people dont support a revolutionary theocracy. But there are also the people who are actually in charge of this massive repression apparatus. And so one of my concerns is also that we pursue a policy of regime change, and what actually happens domestically in Iran is far greater repression and far more insecurity to the extent that the civilians are the ones who suffer the most. Regime change is ultimately up to the Iranian people. One would hope that this regime does fall at some point and some democratic government rises. But, you know, thats not always how international relations play out."

        "content": "After showing up at a federal court hearing for Michael Cohen, the disgraced personal attorney for President Donald Trump who recently found himself the subject of a raid by federal prosecutors at the behest of special counsel Robert Mueller, Stormy Daniels unveiled a sketch of the man who she claims threatened her against revealing her alleged affair with Trump back in 2011.\n\nWhile recounting the alleged threat to Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes last month, Daniels claimed that a man walked up to her and said, Leave Trump alone. Forget the story. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said the man then looked at her daughter and said, Thats a beautiful little girl. Itd be a shame if something happened to her mom.\n\nJoined by her lawyer Michael Avenatti, Daniels sat down with moderator Whoopi Goldberg and the full panel of ABCs The View for her first and only live interview. Goldberg introduced Daniels to the program, which is hosted exclusively by women, by saying that the performer was on a mission to be heard about the alleged affair with the guy in the White House. But her co-panelist Meghan McCain seemed intent on preventing Daniels from accomplishing that mission.\n\nMcCain began her questioning by casting doubt on the legitimacy of Daniels desire to be heard in spite of her allegations of being silenced by powerful men. It seems like a publicity stunt on some level, McCain said, as she also questioned Daniels motive for showing up at Cohens court hearing, where camera crews were waiting.\n\nI understand that youre being sued by our president, but it does seem like youre benefiting a lot, McCain said before appearing to pass judgment on Daniels career choice by taking issue with her current project being called the Make America Horny Again tour.\n\nNo disrespect, I hadnt heard your name until all of this had happened, McCain continued. And now you are literally live on The View giving an entire interview with us. So it has been beneficial for your career.\n\nStormy Daniels' response to those who say she is profiting from the scandal: \"There's a lot of publicity, but I didn't do it for that because this is not what I want to be known for.\" https://t.co/f8u2wc159S pic.twitter.com/RVksH2A9SE  The View (@TheView) April 17, 2018\n\nAfter pointing out her own perceived role as an adorner of fame in America, McCain made a point to clarify that Daniels was not the first adult star she had interviewed before ultimately dismissing her own argument. I have respect for any woman who does well in any industry, its whatever, she clarified.\n\nYet McCains thinly-veiled victim blaming did not stop there. Have you thought about all of the implications of this on the Trump family? McCain asked Daniels.\n\nDaniels made it clear that deciding to tell her story to the nation was not a decision that she took lightly, and that with a track record of success in her industry where she eventually rose to director, she had no desire to be famous merely for an alleged sexual relationship with a man who went on to become president. Its overwhelming, and intimidating and downright scary sometimes, she admitted. While acknowledging that she is making more money, Daniels added context: She is also spending more money due to new needs that include bodyguards, drivers and legal bills.\n\nThe adult film star had a two-folded message for the American public: This is not a publicity stunt, and I am sick and tired of being bullied.\n\nWhat I do for a living should not matter, Daniels told the women of The View. What I do for a job doesnt impact my ability to know right from wrong  or my ability to tell the truth.\n\nNEW: On @TheView, Stormy Daniels and lawyer release composite sketch of person she says threatened her to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Donald Trump. https://t.co/lEpff3uN2l pic.twitter.com/PbvtI7eRso  ABC News (@ABC) April 17, 2018\n\nThe sketch of the man who allegedly threatened Daniels and her daughter was drawn by Lois Gibson, who has been given the title of The Worlds Most Successful Forensic Artist by The Guinness Book of World Records. According to her website, Gibsons work has aided investigators in correctly identifying more than 750 criminals.\n\nWritten on the sketch is Daniels description of the perpetrator, whom she described as being in his 30s to early 40s at the time, ranging in height from 59 to 60 and being lean but fit. The unveiling quickly became one of the top trends on Twitter, as Avenatti stated, Were offering a 100,000 award for information leading to the capture of this man. Avenatti also set up a Gmail account with a memorable username: ID the thug.\n\nWe think we know who sent him, Avenatti claimed before adding, We know that someone knows something.\n\nDaniels attorney also offered his blunt predictions of Michael Cohens legal fate. Of the presidents lawyer, who reportedly arranged multiple hush payments for Republican politicians, including one valued at $130,000 in exchange for Daniels silence in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, Avenatti said there was no question in his mind that Cohen would be indicted by prosecutors and eventually turn on the president in exchange for leniency. He hasnt done him any favors, Avenatti said of Trump, who publicly denied knowing about the payment to White House reporters.\n\nMichael Cohen is my attorney, and youll have to ask Michael, Trump said at the time."

The court said it would hear that case together with the West Virginia case.\n\nAt issue is the meaning of Title IX, the federal education law that has been credited with opening the door for the vast expansion of womens sports. Schools and colleges were told they must give girls equal opportunities in athletics by providing them with separate sports teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past decade, however, states and their schools divided on the question of who can participate on the girls team. Is it only those who were girls at birth or can it also include those whose gender identity is female?\n\nWest Virginia told the court its legislature concluded that biological boys should compete on boys and co-ed teams but not girls teams. This separation made sense, the legislature found, because of the inherent physical differences between biological males and biological females.\n\nCalifornia and most Democratic states allow transgender girls to compete in sports competitions for women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, the Legislature said a student shall be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions...consistent with his or her gender identity.\n\nThe Supreme Court had put off a decision on this issue while the divide among the states grew.\n\nMcCuskey, West Virginias attorney general, said he was confident the court would uphold the states law. It is time to return girls sports to the girls and stop this misguided gender ideology once and for all, he said in a statement.\n\nLawyers for Lambda Legal and the ACLU said the court should not uphold exclusionary laws.\n\nOur client just wants to play sports with her friends and peers, said Sasha Buchert, director of Non-Binary and Transgender Rights Project at Lambda Legal.\n\nCategorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth, said Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLUs LGBTQ & HIV Project. We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.\n\nTwo years ago, the justices turned down a fast-track appeal from West Virginias lawyers on a 7-2 vote and allowed a 12-year old transgender girl to run on the girls cross country team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecky Pepper-Jackson and her mother sued after the school principal said she was barred by the states law from competing on the girls teams at her middle school in Bridgeport, W. Va.\n\nShe has lived as a girl in all aspects of her life for years and receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy, so has not experienced (and will not experience) endogenous puberty, her mother said in support of their lawsuit.\n\nACLU lawyers said then the court should stand aside. They said B.P.J. was eager to participate in sports but was too slow to compete in the track events on the girls team.\n\nLast year, West Virginia tried again and urged the Supreme Court to review the 4th Circuits decision and uphold its restrictions on transgender athletes.\n\nThe state attorneys also claimed the would-be middle school athlete had become a track star.\n\nThis spring, B.P.J. placed top three in every track event B.P.J. competed in, winning most. B.P.J. beat over 100 girls, displacing them over 250 times while denying multiple girls spots and medals in the conference championship. B.P.J. won the shot put by more than three feet while placing second in discus, they told the court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, the court opted to rule first in a Tennessee case to decide if states may prohibit puberty blockers, hormones and other medical treatments for young teens who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\n\nOn June 18, the courts conservative majority said state lawmakers had the authority to restrict medical treatments for adolescents who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, noting the ongoing debate over the long-term risks and benefits. The ruling turned aside the contention that law reflected unconstitutional sex discrimination.\n\nOn Thursday, the justices released their final orders list before their summer recess granting review of new cases to be heard in the fall. Included were the cases of West Virginia vs. BJP and Little vs. Hecox.\n\nIn response to the appeals, ACLU lawyers accused the state of seeking to create a false sense of national emergency based on a legal challenge by one transgender girl.\n\nThe lawsuit said the state measure was part of a concerted nationwide effort to target transgender youth for unequal treatment. The suit contended the law violated Title IX and was unconstitutional because it discriminated against student athletes based on their gender identity.\n\nWest Virginias lawyers saw a threat to Title IX and womens sports.\n\nThey said the rulings upholding transgender rights took a law designed to ensure meaningful competitive opportunities for women and girlsbased on biological differences  and fashioned it into a lever for males to force their way onto girls sports teams based on identity, destroying the very opportunities Title IX was meant to protect."

Human Rights Council voted on Monday to renew the mandate of an LGBTQ rights expert, a move welcomed by advocates amid the absence of the United States, a former key supporter that is now rolling back such protections.\n\nWestern diplomats had previously voiced concerns about the renewal of the mandate of South African scholar Graeme Reid who helps to boost protections by documenting abuses and through dialogue with countries.\n\nThe motion for a three-year renewal passed with 29 votes in favor, 15 against and three abstentions. Supporters included Chile, Germany, Kenya and South Africa while several African nations and Qatar opposed it.\n\nThe renewal of this mandate is a spark of hope in a time when reactionary powers worldwide are trying to dismantle progress that our communities fought so hard to achieve, said Julia Ehrt, executive director of campaign group ILGA World.\n\nThe United States, which has disengaged from the council under President Donald Trump, citing an alleged antisemitic bias, was previously a supporter of the mandate under the Biden administration.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has signed executive orders to curb transgender rights and dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion practices in the government and private sector.\n\nHis administration says such steps restore fairness, but civil rights and LGBTQ advocates say they make marginalized groups more vulnerable.\n\nIn negotiations before the vote, Pakistan voiced opposition to the mandate on behalf of Muslim group OIC, calling it a tool to advocate controversial views.\""

        "content": "Viola Daviss acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress began with a thanks to the Academy and this observation: You know, theres one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered.\n\nPause. Some viewers may have felt a queasy pang. Was the Fences actress about to give a sequel to Meryl Streeps Golden Globes speech? Was the next line going to be this room, so as to stand up for the presidentially denounced entertainment industry, so as to preach for truth and inclusion, so as to spark another skirmish about whether Hollywood is too self-regarding?\n\nNo. The next line: One place, and thats the graveyard.\n\nWhew. Daviss speech quickly went viral and received wide acclaim for a lot of reasons, and prime among them was simply good writing. She opened with a question and gave an answer few would have guessed. She exploited the power of surprise, a power demonstrated amply elsewhere at the Oscars.\n\nThe speech also made self-evident why Davis deserves an Oscar. She seemed to be heaving with emotion, almost out of breath, and yet her words were clear and her sentences deftly paced. She gestured with the precision of her How to Get Away With Murder character Annalise Keating in law lecture, yet she showed the rawness of feeling that Mrs. Miller had in Doubt. But this was not acting. Or if it was, it was so good as to not seem like it. Which is, as Leonardo DiCaprio said from the stage elsewhere in the night, the definition of great acting.\n\nMost remarkable: the speechs content. Typically, memorable Oscar acceptances make explicit political points, feature gaffes, or mark milestones. But Daviss commanded attention through the mere discussion of art, as well as through specific, heartfelt shoutouts to colleagues and loved ones.\n\nPeople ask me all the time: What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola? she said. And I say, exhume those bodies, exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition, people who fell in love and lost. I became an artistand thank God I didbecause we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.\n\nThe resonance with Daviss work was obvious: Fences is based on August Wilsons play about a 1950s black working-class family whose members arent famous, who simply strive and spar against the backdrop of society and history. Wilson exhumed and exalted the ordinary people, Davis said; his story was about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness, and grace.\n\nBut the resonance with other themes of the night, and the era, was also unmissable. The Best Picture nominees included many tales of the culturally invisible and frustrated: post-recession Texans bereft of opportunity in Hell or High Water, low-level NASA mathematicians mostly forgotten by history in Hidden Figures, orphans and destitute families in India in Lion. Most notably, Best Picture winner Moonlight unspooled the tale of a poor black gay man simply surviving, an ordinary life of the sort that is portrayed so infrequently as to seem extraordinary.\n\nSo there is, in fact, politics here, though subtle. In the context of conversations about diversity and inclusion at the Oscars and in America more generally, Daviss praise of stories about common people of thwarted dreams necessarily has a political meaning: Portraying previously unportrayed struggles means that lives other than white, straight, well-off, and/or male matter."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "The US House of Representatives on Thursday passed Donald Trumps massive tax-and-spending bill after Senate Republicans on Tuesday narrowly passed it, with JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.\n\nHeres whats in the final version of the bill, which now heads to Donald Trumps desk:\n\nExtending big tax cuts After taking office in 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered taxes and increased the standard deduction for all taxpayers, but generally benefited high earners more than most. Those provisions are set to expire after this year, but the big, beautiful bill makes them permanent, while increasing the standard deduction by $1,000 for individuals, $1,500 for heads of households and $2,000 for married couples, albeit only through 2028.\n\nCutting tax on tips or overtime The bill has an array of new tax write-offs  but only while Trump is president. Several of the new exemptions stem from promises Trump made while campaigning last year. Taxpayers will be able to write off income from tips and overtime, and interest made on loans to purchase cars assembled in the United States. People aged 65 and over are eligible for an additional deduction of $6,000, provided their adjusted gross income does not exceed $75,000 for single filers or $150,000 for couples. But all of these incentives expire at the end of 2028, right before Trumps term as president ends.\n\nMoney for mass deportations and a border wall As part of Trumps plan to remove undocumented immigrants from the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will receive $45bn for detention facilities, $14bn for deportation operations and billions of dollars more to hire an additional 10,000 new agents by 2029. More than $50bn is allocated for the construction of new border fortifications, which will probably include a wall along the border with Mexico.\n\nSlashing Medicaid and food stamps Republicans have attempted to cut down on the bills cost by slashing two major federal safety-net programs: Medicaid, which provides healthcare to poor and disabled Americans, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which helps people afford groceries. Both are in for funding cuts, as well as new work requirements. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the Medicaid changes could cost as many as 10.6 million people their healthcare, and about eight million people, or one in five recipients, their Snap benefits.\n\nCuts to green energy The bill will phase out many tax incentives created by Congress during Joe Bidens presidency meant to encourage consumers and businesses to use electric vehicles and other clean-energy technology. Credits for cleaner cars will end this year, as will subsidies for Americans seeking to upgrade their homes to cleaner or more energy-efficient appliances. While a draft of the bill targeted wind- and solar-energy projects with a new excise tax, senators voted to remove that at the last minute.\n\nState and local tax relief (Salt) One of the thorniest issues the bill addresses is how much relief to provide from state and local taxes (Salt), which many Americans must also pay in addition to their federal tax. Several House Republicans representing districts in Democratic-led states withheld their support from the bill until the Salt deductibility cap was raised from $10,000 to $40,000, but Senate Republicans made clear they would change that. The Senates version keeps the $40,000 cap, but only through 2028.\n\nRaising the debt ceiling The bill will increase the US governments authority to borrow, known as the debt limit, by $5tn. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has predicted the government will hit the limit by August, at which point it could default on its debt and spark a financial crisis.\n\nMore benefits for the rich than the poor Wealthier taxpayers appear set to receive more benefits from this bill than poorer ones, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. Taxpayers in the lowest-income quintile will see a 2.5% decrease in their incomes, largely due to the Snap and Medicaid cuts, while the highest earners will see their incomes grow by 2.4%, the Budget Lab estimated. The impact could change based on which amendments the Senate adopts."

        "content": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nMADISON, Wis.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court cleared the way Tuesday for the state to institute a ban on conversion therapy in a ruling that gives the governor more power over how state laws are enacted.\n\nThe court ruled that a Republican-controlled legislative committee's rejection of a state agency rule that would ban the practice of conversion therapy for LGBTQ people was unconstitutional. The decision, which has a broad impact far beyond the conversion therapy issue, takes power away from the Legislature to block the enactment of rules by the governor's office that carry the force of law.\n\nThe 4-3 ruling from the liberal-controlled court comes amid the national battle over LGBTQ+ rights. It is also part of a broader effort by the Democratic governor, who has vetoed Republican bills targeting transgender high school athletes, to rein in the power of the GOP-controlled Legislature.\n\nWhat is conversion therapy?\n\nWhat is known as conversion therapy is the scientifically discredited practice of using therapy to \"convert\" LGBTQ people to heterosexuality or traditional gender expectations.\n\nThe practice has been banned in 23 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ rights think tank. It is also banned in more than a dozen communities across Wisconsin. Since April 2024, the Wisconsin professional licensing board for therapists, counselors and social workers has labeled conversion therapy as unprofessional conduct.\n\nAdvocates seeking to ban the practice want to forbid mental health professionals in the state from counseling clients with the goal of changing their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court agreed in March to hear a Colorado case about whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.\n\nWhat is happening in Wisconsin?\n\nThe provision barring conversion therapy in Wisconsin has been blocked twice by the Legislature's powerful Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules  a Republican-controlled panel in charge of approving state agency regulations.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling means the conversion therapy ban can be enacted. The court ruled that the legislative committee has been overreaching its authority in blocking a variety of other state regulations during Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' administration.\n\nThe lawsuit brought by Evers targeted two votes by the joint committee. One deals with the Department of Safety and Professional Services' conversion therapy ban. The other vote blocked an update to the state's commercial building standards.\n\nRepublicans who supported suspending the conversion therapy ban have insisted the issue isn't the policy itself, but whether the licensing board had the authority to take the action it did.\n\nEvers has been trying since 2020 to get the ban enacted, but the Legislature has stopped it from going into effect.\n\nEvers and legislative leaders did not immediately respond to messages seeking reaction to the ruling.\n\nLegislative power weakened by ruling\n\nThe Legislature's attorney argued that decades of precedent backed up their argument, including a 1992 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling upholding the Legislature's right to suspend state agency rules.\n\nEvers argued that by blocking the rule, the legislative committee is taking over powers that the state constitution assigns to the governor and exercising an unconstitutional \"legislative veto.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed with Evers.\n\nThe court found that the Legislature was violating the state constitution's requirement that any laws pass both houses of the Legislature and be presented to the governor.\n\nInstead, in this case the Legislature was illegally taking \"action that alters the legal rights and duties of the executive branch and the people of Wisconsin,\" Chief Justice Jill Karofsky wrote for the majority. She was joined by the court's three other liberal justices.\n\nConservative Justice Brian Hagedorn, in a dissent, said the court's ruling is \"devoid of legal analysis and raises more questions than it answers.\"\n\nHagedorn argued for a more narrow ruling that would have only declared unconstitutional the legislative committee's indefinite objection to a building code rule.\n\nFellow conservative justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley also dissented, saying the ruling shifts too much power to the executive branch and holds the Legislature to a higher legal standard.\n\nBradley said the ruling \"lets the executive branch exercise lawmaking power unfettered and unchecked.\"\n\nThe issue goes beyond conversion therapy\n\nThe conversion therapy ban is one of several rules that have been blocked by the legislative committee. Others pertain to environmental regulations, vaccine requirements and public health protections.\n\nEnvironmental groups hailed the ruling.\n\nThe decision will prevent a small number of lawmakers from blocking the enactment of environmental protections passed by the Legislature and signed into law, said Wilkin Gibart, executive director of Midwest Environmental Advocates.\n\nThe court previously sided with Evers in one issue brought in the lawsuit, ruling 6-1 last year that another legislative committee was illegally preventing the state Department of Natural Resources from funding grants to local governments and nongovernmental organizations for environmental projects under the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program."

The advocacy group is representing Garcia.\n\nThe arrest of immigrants has escalated nationwide, notably at Home Depot sites, where undocumented laborers in particular gather in parking lots outside branches of the store chain, waiting to be picked up for casual work.\n\nSuch sweeps have been on the rise, especially since a May meeting in which top White House officials placed significant pressure on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials to step up arrest numbers.\n\nWhy arent you at Home Depot? the White House adviser Stephen Miller reportedly asked the Ice top managers during the heated meeting, where Ice was instructed to arrest at least 3,000 people a day under Donald Trumps immigration crackdown, which would amount to a million arrests ayear.\n\nIce raids and arrests outside Home Depot outlets last month led to massive demonstrations in Los Angeles in particular. The protests set up a showdown between the California state government and the Trump administration, after the US president deployed the national guard over the objection of the governor, in a rare and extreme move, to clamp down on the pockets of fierce protests across the sprawling metropolis.\n\nGarcias claim, submitted by Maldef, is under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which allows individuals to sue the federal government for wrongful acts by employees in the course of their duties, the organization says.\n\nThe document, submitted on Tuesday, is a formal FTCA notice, which is required to be submitted before filing an official lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the claim submitted to Ice and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Garcia was present at a Home Depot on the morning of 19 June doing some delivery work, when he noticed masked immigration officials arresting day laborers.\n\nGarcia began recording the arrests on his phone and began advising people inside a commercial truck to not respond to immigration officials, who wanted to arrest them, too. The masked officials then smashed the window of the truck to arrest the men.\n\nGarcia said he continued recording the interaction, when suddenly, with no warning from an agent, one of the masked officials lunged at him, threw the mans phone and tackled him. Other officials joined in, pinning Garcia to the floor and placing cuffs on him.\n\nThe Border Patrol and Ice agents unlawfully restrained and detained Mr Garcia for more than 24 hours without any valid grounds for interfering with his liberty and freedom of movement, and they did so based on legally prohibited grounds, the complaint reads.\n\nGarcia was later taken to the federal Metropolitan detention center in Los Angeles and detained for a total of 25 hours, despite asserting multiple times that he was a US citizen. He was later released without arraignment or notification of charges.\n\nMaldef says Garcia suffered physical injury, emotional distress, and economic losses from the entire experience, including bruising all over his body and emotional distress.\n\nWhen government engages in widespread violation of individual rights with respect to immigrants without status, the harm inevitably spills over and spreads to others; that is why we must insist, as a society, on respect for the rights of everyone, Thomas Saenz, Maldef president and general counsel, said in a statement.\n\nHere, a citizen, acting in the best traditions of our democracy, was engaged in documenting government misconduct to encourage policy change; he was wrongfully arrested and detained because of his race and his heroic efforts.\n\nThe DHS views the situation differently. In a statement to NBC, a department spokesperson said that Garcia assaulted and verbally harassed a federal agent and that he was subdued and arrested for the alleged assault."

        "content": "Federal government workers are nothing like the overpaid and too-numerous lot that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, and their attendant DOGE commission, say they are. In fact, federal workers have perhaps been among the groups of workers whove been least successful at advancing their interests over the past 40 years.\n\nThe reality of how federal workers are and have been treated should be a focal point for a defeated and disorganized left, whether among the moderates blaming the far left or among those who agree with Bernie Sanders that party leadership has lost touch with workers. The fight for federal workers is the first battle in the upcoming assault on the federal government. The left would be wise to use a full-throated defense of federal workers an opportunity to portray Donald Trump, Musk, Ramaswamy and the entire GOP as cruel and unconcerned with actual working people.\n\nOne notable aspect of the ongoing discussions of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is the dearth of actual federal workers amongst those discussing the matter. As an employee of the Bureau of Economic Analysis for over 15 years, ending in March 2022, I can tell you the situation has gotten steadily worse for decades. Federal workers are underpaid, mistreated and lack the voice in society to fight back. And theyve proven to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.\n\nThe federal workforce, as a share of the total U.S. population, has shrunk since 1982. In October 1982, there were 2.890 million federal workers. Forty-two years later, in October 2024, that figure totaled 3.001 million, a miserly increase of less than four percent. During that same period, the total U.S. population increased over 104 million, or about forty-five percent. Total local government employment grew from 9.430 million to 14.940 million over those forty-two years, an increase of nearly five million, while state government employment grew from 3.636 million to 5.514 million, an increase of about 1.9 million. Thus, state and local government employment basically kept up with forty-five percent population growth over those years, while federal employment barely grew at all.\n\nNor are federal workers overpaid. In fact, their pay has been eroding relative to private sector counterparts for the last three decades. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) was passed in 1990 to increase federal worker pay to catch up to private-sector pay. Federal statue written from FEPCA guides for annual federal employee pay increases to be calculated as half of one percent less than the increase in the employment cost index (ECI), a measure of total worker compensation prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, according to the same statute, the president may ignore the ECI in cases of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare and simply come up with a lower number. Since FEPCA was passed in 1990, every single Democratic and Republican president has done exactly that, with little comment from the mainstream press (which, to be fair, pays little attention to most aspects of worker pay or power.) So, for the pay raise in 2025, the ECI increase was 3.86%, but the pay raise decreed by the president will only be 2%.\n\nAfter three-and-a-half decades of these arbitrary raises, federal worker pay is 24.72% behind what it is for comparable private-sector workers, according to a report from the Federal Salary Council, which uses BLS survey data to generate comprehensive comparison statistics.\n\nNeither party takes up the mantle for federal worker rights. While Musk and Ramaswamy seem outright hostile to the idea of federal government employment, even Democrats like Barack Obama are willing to shiv federal workers when it suits them.\n\nObama embraced the language of austerity in November 2010, when he froze federal pay for two years, announcing, Just as families and businesses around the nation have tightened their belts so must their government. This analysis is wrong; a nation is not constrained to operate as a family or business does and cut in difficult times. In fact, economists now acknowledge that federal spending was too small coming out of the Great Recession. If Obama had had greater respect for federal workers as a constituency of the Democratic Party, he could have bent over backward to justify increasing federal pay as a pro-stimulus measure, as Republicans quicky embrace cutting taxes on businesses to fight recessions.\n\nObama additionally introduced an element of generational warfare in the federal service when, as part of two budget compromises with Republicans, he twice increased the required pension contributions of newer federal employees. All told this means that, while federal workers who started before 2013 pay 0.8 percent of their salary towards funding their pensions, employees hired in 2014 or later pay over five times that amount. This is a terrible idea for worker solidarity; newer workers may direct their frustrations at those paid more simply for having started earlier. It also reinforces the idea that boomers and other generations simply pull up the ladder on later generations rather than fighting for all workers.\n\nWe need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism\n\nDemocrats often choose Cabinet secretaries with histories of opposing worker rights. BEA is an agency within the Department of Commerce; Obamas longest-serving Secretary of Commerce was billionaire heiress Penny Pritzker, whose family runs the Hyatt Hotel chain. Before becoming Commerce Secretary, her company turned on heat lamps above the heads of workers striking in a picket line outside a Hyatt hotel, in weather in which temperatures were already above 90 degrees. She also opposed efforts to raise teachers salaries with money from Chicagos tax increment financing fund, preferring that $5.1 billion from that fund be used to finance a Hyatt-franchised hotel. Pritzker feuded with the head of the Chicago Teachers Union, Karen Lewis  an actual leader for workers whose militancy invigorated unionized labor  for years, yet Obama still appointed Pritzker Commerce Secretary after her anti-worker behavior.\n\nOr consider Joseph Bidens Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who in 2011 as Rhode Island Treasurer cut state workers pensions after deciding to invest pension assets in hedge funds, an industry in which Raimondo spent most of her private sector career. How can federal workers think theyll get a fair shake if even Democrats appoint people like this to be their bosses?\n\nOf the 2.3 million federal workers tallied by FedScope Federal Workforce Database (which excludes Postal employees, intelligence agencies, and a few very small agencies), over 750,000 work for the Departments of Defense. Another half million work in the Veterans Administration and over 200,000 work for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThat leaves only about 800,000 for every other major function of the federal government, from tax collection to maintaining our national parks, to safeguarding our nuclear systems, administering Pell Grants, and prosecuting criminals.\n\nMajor and important duties are carried out by surprisingly small and shrinking staff. The Social Security Administration has fewer than 60,000 workers working to pay out about $1.4 trillion in annual benefits. If the U.S. federal government is an insurance company with an army, then this major insurance component operates tremendously efficiently. Administrative costs total only 0.5% of annual benefits, about a quarter of the percentage cost fifty years ago, and far cheaper than private retirement annuities.\n\nFor another example, the Food Safety and Inspection Service does the unglamorous job of inspecting meat, eggs, and other foods for consumer safety. Three workers even died of COVID doing their jobs during the pandemics initial onslaught. They have about 8,600 employees as of March 2024. That is down from September 2004, when it had about 10,200 employees, a decrease of about fifteen percent, even though the economy is nearly fifty percent larger. A recent Gallup poll found that Americans confidence in food safety has dropped by 23 points between 2006 and 2024. Why are Trump, Musk and Ramaswamy so confident theres so much government waste and so many worthless employees?\n\nWhile they dont tell us how they know, theyre dismissive in their confidence. Ramaswamy laid out his plans for federal workers in a podcast: If your Social Security Number ends in an odd number, you're out. If it ends in an even number, you're in. There's a 50% cut right there. Of those who remain, if your Social Security Number starts in an even number, you're in. And if it starts with an odd number, you're out. Boom, that's a 75% reduction, then literally, sarcastically, okay. He then backpedals slightly by saying that this is a thought experiment, not a policy prescription.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nBut do the people who inspect our food, send out our social security benefits, or calculate our economic statistics deserve this terrorizing thought experiment? And how much of Trumps behavior initially tows the line between joking and threatening? Given how desperately the right wants to be offended, might it not be time for the left to be offended on behalf of actual workers?\n\nUnlike state government workers and national civil servants in other countries, federal workers lack the ability to fight back through strikes. The Chicago Teachers Union strikes of 2012 showed that local government workers can challenge even Democratic politicians like Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor who backed neoliberal privatization efforts aimed at marginalizing public school teachers. These strikes sparked similar efforts in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona, and laid the groundwork for political efforts that are still paying off. Brandon Johnson, a key organizer of those strikes, is now Chicagos mayor. ()\n\nThe ability to strike changes the dynamic. BEA, where I worked for 15 years, produces estimates of gross domestic product and myriad other economic statistics, which underlie the work of Wall Street analysts, financial journalists, economic researchers and countless others. Many of these very people are interested in the ethical treatment of workers (at, say, their local grocery store or Starbucks), but since workers at BEA cant strike, we couldnt easily convey to our customers that we were being mistreated. The disciplinary policy at Commerce allows only one punishment for violation of no-strike affidavit: removal.\n\nWithout a union or labor consciousness from society, federal workers are walking into a Kafkaesque nightmare of unclear policies and pretend standards in a second Trump administration.\n\nA Democratic Party interested in workers should find it very easy and intuitive to fight against Musk and Ramaswamy on this issue. Musk has repeatedly tweeted variations of himself asking people, in the context of federal workers, So What would you say you do here? a reference to \"Office Space\" that, given the storyline in that movie, implies the answer is nothing or very little. He treats his own workers with the same arrogance and dismissiveness. In 2022, while we were still recovering from the pandemic, Musk imperiously announced that telework wouldnt be available any longer for Telsa workers and charged that those who wanted to telework should pretend to work somewhere else.\n\nCan you imagine having any self-respect and continuing to work for this man? People (including, Im sure, Tesla workers) made tremendous sacrifices over the pandemic, often only surviving because telework was an option, but he has no problem announcing in public that they were pretending. And even if he wants to behave rudely towards his own workers, we neednt do so towards ours.\n\nYet Democrats have embraced Musk, with Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, whos cultivated a working-class mien, saying he admires the billionaire. That so many Democrats tolerate the degrading language that Musk and Ramaswamy use towards federal employees implies that they think being a federal employee is degrading, and Democrats treatment of federal workers these last two decades demonstrates the same.\n\nThe treatment of federal workers is the moral choice and responsibility of the citizenry en toto, and theres nothing that says we must lower ourselves to the moral level of an Elon Musk, nothing that says we have to accept language like little jobs to describe all that federal workers do. Resisting the DOGE commission must be the next step in Democrats showing theyre a workers party, like they say they are."

        "content": "After an overnight session and hours of floor debate, the House voted Thursday to approve the Big Beautiful Bill  clearing its final hurdle in a landmark achievement for President Trump, who wrangled Republican lawmakers to pass the most expensive legislation in history by the Fourth of July.\n\nThe 218 to 214 vote, which saw two Republican members side with the Democrats in opposition, was delayed by a record-breaking speech on the House floor by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries that lasted eight hours and 44 minutes. Im going to take my time, Jeffries said before launching into a marathon excoriation of the legislation, its Medicaid cuts and its Republican backers. Shame on this institution if this bill passes.\n\nThe bill encompasses Trumps domestic agenda, extending tax breaks to millions of American households and businesses that are projected to add trillions to the national debt. The legislation also introduces new tax relief for senior citizens, tip and overtime workers, and new parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo offset a fraction of those costs, Republicans approved new barriers to access for Medicaid and cut funding streams under the Affordable Care Act, placing the healthcare of nearly 12 million in jeopardy over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps, was also cut.\n\nIt has been a controversial bill within the Republican Party ever since it was conceived at the beginning of Trumps second term, with fiscal hawks decrying its record contributions to annual deficits, and moderate Republicans fearing its cuts to healthcare would come back to haunt them in future elections.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the vote, senior White House officials said Trump was the omnipresent force behind the legislation, crediting his personal relationships with lawmakers on the Hill for its ultimate success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIve lost count of the number of meetings the president has had, one White House official said, adding that the bill satisfies virtually every campaign promise the president made.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said that Republicans defied the doubters and the panicans to secure passage of legislation that would add funding for at least 1 million deportations per year.\n\nBeyond tax relief and healthcare cuts, the bill increases defense spending and adds a historic $150 billion to fund border security and mass deportations, exponentially increasing the budget of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  a fund larger than many national armies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitics Republican holdouts bristle at Trump pressure over megabill Frustration within the Republican Party was coming from two camps: fiscal hawks and lawmakers representing districts that heavily rely on Medicaid.\n\nThe president, Leavitt said, would host a big, beautiful signing ceremony Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern, marked by fireworks on the National Mall celebrating Independence Day  a deadline he imposed on the Republican caucus to secure passage of the legislation.\n\nIt also includes a host of parochial provisions. The bill provides $1 billion for security, planning and other costs for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and $30 million for the construction of a sculpture-laden American Garden of Heroes to be built at an undetermined location.\n\nIn total, the Congressional Budget Office projects the bill could add up to $3.3 trillion to the debt by 2034. Republicans dispute the figure as inflated, arguing the CBO assumes status economic growth, while still other groups say the projection is conservative.\n\nIn a statement after the vote, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which has advocated fiscal responsibility for decades, warned the bill would add more than $4 trillion to the debt, accelerate the insolvency of Social Security and Medicare, and leave us even more vulnerable to the whims of the Treasury markets.\n\nIn a massive fiscal capitulation, Congress has passed the single most expensive, dishonest, and reckless budget reconciliation bill ever  and, it comes amidst an already alarming fiscal situation, the group said. Never before has a piece of legislation been jammed through with such disregard for our fiscal outlook, the budget process, and the impact it will have on the well-being of the country and future generations.\n\nAnd yet, despite issuing scathing criticisms of the Senate language for its historic contributions to the debt, opposition from the House Freedom Caucus, also founded to advocate for fiscal responsibility, all but melted away in the early hours of Thursday under intense pressure from the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral of the Medicaid provisions kick in only after the 2026 midterms, buying Republicans time to sell the bill without facing its real-world consequences before the next election. But Democrats are already campaigning against the legislation as the greatest attack on healthcare since Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, which prompted a Democratic wave in midterms the following year.\n\nThe legislation introduces a work requirement for Medicaid enrollment that will require extensive new paperwork for applicants, and restricts state taxes on healthcare providers, known as the provider tax, an essential tool for many states in their efforts to supplement Medicaid funding.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers fear that provision could have devastating effects on rural hospitals. The Senate added a rural hospital fund to the bill to help mitigate some of the impacts of the funding cuts.\n\nThe bill also rolls back green energy tax credits that have fueled an entire manufacturing workforce in wind and solar energy in states across the country.\n\nThe bill passed through the Senate despite bipartisan opposition, with three Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. House approval of the Senate text Thursday morning occurred barely 24 hours after the upper chambers vote.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a number of House Republican lawmakers had said openly they would not support a rushed process to approve the bill. But a floor vote on debate rules kept open by House Speaker Mike Johnson throughout the night kept conversations active, and ultimately swayed the holdouts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo Republican House members, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, voted against the final bill, citing its effects to the healthcare system and to the national debt, respectively.\n\nWhat a great night it was, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform before the final vote. One of the most consequential Bills ever. The USA is the HOTTEST Country in the World, by far!!!\n\nIn the call with reporters, one White House official also credited Vice President JD Vance for his efforts to secure a victory on the legislation, noting his huddle hours before a final Senate vote on Tuesday with Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a lawmaker who secured exceptional carve-outs for her state in the bill and yet still expressed disappointment with its harshest provisions after voting to approve it.\n\nDemocrats will welcome the vice president receiving credit. Several expressed hope to The Times they can tie any successor of Trumps to unpopular healthcare cuts in 2028."

        "content": "President Trump is nearing a historic decision on whether to join Israels war against Iran, a choice that will reshape the Middle East while dividing his Cabinet and his party over Americas role in the world.\n\nThe fateful choice has presented itself, U.S. and Israeli officials told The Times, after Israeli forces cleared a runway for Washingtons involvement by hobbling Iranian air defenses and reducing the risks to U.S. aircraft. We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran, Trump wrote on social media Tuesday, calling for Irans unconditional surrender over the future of its decades-old nuclear program.\n\nUp until Friday, when Israels surprise attack began, the president had been skeptical of its prospects and had distanced himself from the operation. Israels air and intelligence forces have targeted Irans nuclear sites, scientific and military leadership, air defenses and ballistic missile networks, killing at least 224 people, according to Iranian authorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGermanys chancellor, Friedrich Merz, bluntly described the Israeli operation in a Tuesday interview. This is the dirty work that Israel is doing for all of us, he said.\n\nBut Israels initial success has presented Trump with an opportunity to proceed with singular strike capabilities that could, in theory, destroy Irans nuclear program for good. Bunker-busting bombs made only in America, flown and dropped by unique American planes, could entomb Irans most advanced nuclear equipment burrowed into a mountainside at Fordow.\n\nAn Israeli official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, told The Times that the Trump administration has indicated the president shifted his posture in recent days toward more robust support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn our side, we asked for help and American involvement only in defense, the official said. Thats what weve been doing. And if they find it is in their interests because of developments, because of how well the war is going, to join the operation, then that is their decision.\n\nFordow, which today stands as Irans second-largest uranium enrichment site, could still be targeted without U.S. assistance, the Israeli official added. Irans largest enrichment site at Natanz has been damaged by Israeli bombing, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, an assessment shared by U.S. officials and relayed to The Times.\n\nWe started this operation assuming that its a Blue and White operation  only Israel, the official continued. We have different contingencies with how to tackle Fordow. Its not something only the United States could do  its not only dropping that bomb from the air. And we are eager to complete this mission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat mission is the latest chapter in a 20-year saga over Irans nuclear program that has driven U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.\n\nAfter briefly suspending its nuclear work in 2003, spooked by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Islamic Republic restarted uranium enrichment in the Persian city of Isfahan in 2005. Rounds of talks with Europe, followed by expanded talks with the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany, led to complex diplomatic arrangements aimed at oversight of Irans nuclear work, including a 2015 deal brokered by the Obama administration and from which the U.S. withdrew in Trumps first term.\n\nAcross the years, a through line remained: Tehran has always insisted on enriching uranium on its soil, at levels unseen anywhere else in the world for civilian use.\n\nAnd the Iranian government, on a separate track, progressed its research and development on the miniaturization and weaponization of nuclear warheads  itself a challenging task  in order to fit a weapon inside the nose cone of a ballistic missile, according to U.S. intelligence officials. It is that threat, of not knowing what each missile has in store, that has driven Israeli fears over the program for decades.\n\nIran has retaliated since Friday by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones against Israel, so far killing 24 and injuring hundreds, according to Israeli officials.\n\nIn Iran, the nuclear program has become a source of pride to the people and, until now, was seen as an insurance policy for a deeply unpopular regime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExplicit threats over the last 24 hours by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nentanyahu to kill Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, may have an unintended effect, reinforcing concerns in Tehran that attacks on its nuclear program are a smokescreen to upend the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe State Department did not deny that a change of government could ultimately become a goal of the Trump administration. Im certainly not going to remotely address that, Tammy Haddad, a State Department spokesperson, said in a briefing Tuesday.\n\nDeparting the Group of 7 summit in Calgary, Canada, early on Monday night, and calling an emergency meeting of his National Security Council for the next morning, Trump expressed fatigue with the cycle of negotiations, telling reporters aboard Air Force One that he saw another way.\n\nAn end. A real end, he said, asked what could be better than a ceasefire. Not a ceasefire. An end.\n\nA party divided\n\nThe presidents inching toward war has drawn fierce pushback from prominent members of his base, whose interpretation of his central campaign promise, America first, rejects direct U.S. military involvement in foreign wars.\n\nIm a big supporter of Israel, said Stephen K. Bannon, a former chief strategist for Trump, and Im telling people, hey, if we get sucked into this war  which, inexorably, looks like its gonna happen on the combat side  its gonna not just blow up the coalition. Its also gonna thwart what were doing with the most important thing, which is the deportation of the illegal alien invaders that are here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking with Tucker Carlson, a far-right podcaster also critical of a U.S. role in the war, Bannon added: We have to stop it.\n\nIncreasing signs of U.S. involvement on Tuesday prompted rare bipartisan alliances on Capitol Hill, with far-right lawmakers partnering with some of the most progressive members of the Democratic caucus in demanding that any U.S. operation take place only after Congress passes a war powers resolution.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, and GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on Tuesday feuded over the possibility of U.S. military action, with Greene warning of a fracture in the MAGA movement should the president proceed.\n\nBut a U.S. official said that strikes by the United States against isolated targets in the Middle East have taken place before without drawing Washington into a protracted war. Trump is not debating whether to deploy U.S. troops on the ground, the official said.\n\nSigns have also emerged of cracks within Trumps inner circle over the potential strikes.\n\nWriting on social media Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance said that people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy, referring to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue, Vance wrote. He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn right-wing circles, an assessment from two months ago by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, that Iran was not attempting to pursue construction of a nuclear weapon, provided proof of a parallel to the lead-up to the Iraq war. Israel has said its intelligence found Iran was days away from having the materials necessary to build a bomb before it began its campaign.\n\nWhen flying home on Air Force One, Trump was asked about Gabbards assessment. The intelligence chief campaigned for years against regime change wars as a Democratic lawmaker in the House.\n\nI dont care what she said, Trump responded. I think they were very close to having one.\n\n"

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Two interrelated fears that have caused mounting public alarm with respect to the Trump Administration involve unchecked executive power and the erosion of the rule of law. These worries have intensified in debates about the legality of President Trumps decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities more than a week into Israels war against Iran. Members of both houses of Congress had introduced resolutions to try to prevent Trump from taking such military action without its authorization. But the energy that some lawmakers had mustered for a rare attempt to assert Congresss constitutional power against Trump seemed to dissipate, at least while they expected a ceasefire between Israel and Iran to hold.\n\nOne would normally look to Supreme Court precedents to determine the constitutionality of a Presidential action. But no cases provide legal answers about the permissibility of attacks like the one on Iran. The only relevant case from the Court dates to the Civil War. It states that Congress has the sole power to declare war, but that, in the event that a foreign nation invades the U.S., congressional authorization is unnecessary and the Presidents constitutional power as the Commander-in-Chief is sufficient to take action. The Court noted that the President cannot initiate the war, but it has never provided an authoritative definition of war, as opposed to armed conflict.\n\nCongress has not formally declared war since the Second World War, but it has sometimes authorized Presidents to use military force in conflicts colloquially known as warsfor example, in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq. But, when Congress has given no such authorization, Presidents have often turned to the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel. O.L.C. issues opinions that are not binding law, but which attempt to present legally correct boundaries that the President should respect. Presidents have regularly acted unilaterally to enter significant hostilities on the basis of those opinions, including in the Korean War, in Kosovo, and in Libya.\n\nCongress, in the War Powers Resolution of 1973 (enacted over the veto of President Nixon, who thought it unconstitutional), aimed to check the unilateral Presidential use of force, requiring, among other things, that the President consult Congress before sending armed forces into hostilities and obtain congressional approval to deploy troops in conflicts for more than sixty days. But both Democratic and Republican Presidents have not fully complied, and Congress hasnt done much about it. In recent weeks, some lawmakers proposed new War Powers Resolutions to prevent Trump from attacking Iran again unless Congress authorizes it, but the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, resisted the idea and declared that the existing War Powers Resolution was an unconstitutional infringement of the Presidents power as Commander-in-Chief.\n\nDuring the past several decades, O.L.C. has produced opinion after opinion that has been staggeringly expansive with respect to that power. Each armed conflict that a President undertook without congressional authorization became a precedent that further enlarged what the executive branch considered constitutionally permissible. That is how we got to a situation in which a President can reasonably claim that it is lawful, without congressional approval or even consultation, to drop bunker-busting bombs on a country that has not attacked the U.S. One might assume that Trump wouldnt care a whit about precedent, but the telltale way he described the operation in a letter to Congress days after the strikes suggested that he was closely informed by past executive practice. He alluded to key formulations from previous O.L.C. opinions, stating that his strikes discretely targeted Irans nuclear facilities, were limited in scope and purpose, and did not involve ground forcesmeaning that the operation fit the criteria of what O.L.C. has said falls short of war, such that congressional authorization was unnecessary.\n\nTrumps justifications also reflected O.L.C. precedents maintaining that a President can unilaterally use military force abroad to pursue national interests and collective self-defense. The office has construed national interests very broadly, to include ensuring the safe delivery of food and medicine in Somalia, under the first President Bush; assisting an ally or strategic partner, Iraq, under President Obama; and deterring the use and proliferation of chemical weapons, in Syria, during Trumps first term. And collective self-defense can mean not only repelling an imminent attack but also warding off future attacks and defending allies.\n\nJack Goldsmith, a foremost expert on war powers and a professor at Harvard Law School, wrote, in October, 2023, that, under the body of O.L.C. opinions, just about any conceivable circumstance in which a President would think it prudent to use force in the Middle East can be justified. Slowing down Irans ability to create nuclear weapons would satisfy the national interests test as well as the collective self-defense of our ally, Israel, as Trump put it. More recently, Goldsmith rued the troubling reality that there is no constitutional rule that would answer the question of whether the Iran strikes were unlawful. But some lawmakers may believe that it is time for Congress to rethink the acceptance of past executive-branch practice as a justification for future unilateral military actions. Not least because a leaked preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report suggesting, to Trumps ire, that his attack had not completely and totally obliterated Irans nuclear capabilities, if proved correct, may lead him to feel that it is in the national interest to try again. (The Administration said that it might now limit the intelligence it shares with Congress.)\n\nThe courts largely stay out of war-powers debates because those debates are often deemed to entail policy questions rather than legal ones. So if Congress persists in not checking the Presidents use of the military, or even believes that such checks are unconstitutional, his unilateral power will remain nearly unlimited. Before the Iran strikes, concerns about Trump and the military were focussed on his federalization of the California National Guard, which the Administration justified on the theory that violent incidents among those protesting ICE in Los Angeles had turned into a rebellion against the U.S. The Ninth Circuit found that Trumps actions were likely consistent with a statute stipulating that the President may take such steps when unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\n\nWe are learning that, at home and abroad, the ability to curb the most dangerously consequential uses of Presidential power relies mostly on the self-restraint of the Commander-in-Chief. Law gets us only so far, or, sometimes, nowhere. "

        "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed, for now, with deporting migrants to any country that will accept them.\n\nThe one-paragraph, unsigned order stayed a block on such third country removals that was issued by a federal judge in April. The high courts three Democratic-appointed justices dissented.\n\nLegal challenges in the case, Department of Homeland Security v. DVD, will continue, but the order will aid the Trump administrations aggressive deportation agenda. The high court has now approved multiple Trump immigration policies. And the court has again given the administration a legal victory via the justices fast-moving and opaque emergency docket. In another theme of the past five months, the Supreme Court also appears unconcerned with the Trump administration seeming to defy a lower court order.\n\nWhy We Wrote This The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to deport migrants to countries other than their own. The decision opens the door to faster removals of people in the United States without authorization.\n\nBecause the case reached the court via the emergency docket  also known as the shadow docket  the justices received limited briefing and no oral argument. As with Mondays order, Supreme Court decisions in such cases are often short and unsigned.\n\nThis is an unsigned decision, with no analysis, that is going to allow the government to resume sending people to third countries with no notice and no process, says Sarah Sherman-Stokes, an immigration law professor at the Boston University School of Law.\n\nThat should worry us, she adds. But even bigger than that, this decision endorses the government defying a federal court order and getting away with it, and in fact getting rewarded for it.\n\nMondays ruling bodes well for the government, however, says George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a policy organization that supports strict immigration policies.\n\nIn a 2008 decision relating to an American being held in Iraqi custody, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that allegations regarding the likelihood of torture in a foreign country generally must be addressed by the political branches, not the judiciary.\n\nThe tea leaves indicate ... that the court is likely on the merits to rule for the government, says Mr. Fishman.\n\nIncreased use of third-country deportations\n\nThird country deportations are not new, but the Trump administration has sought to expand their use. The law allows the government to remove a migrant to a third country if its impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to remove them to the country they are a citizen of, or the country they entered the United States from.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance that if a third country provides credible assurance that it will not persecute or torture migrants, the U.S. can deport migrants there with minimal due process.\n\nBut the guidance skipped a critical due process step, four migrants have argued in a lawsuit filed that month. U.S. law and international law allow immigrant detainees to challenge their removal to a third country if they believe they would likely experience torture, persecution, or death there. This pleading asks for CAT relief, after the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nJose Diaz/AP/File A plane carrying migrants from Central Asia and India, deported from the United States, arrives at Juan Santamara International Airport in San Jos, Costa Rica, Feb. 20, 2025. The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to deport people to third countries June 23, 2025.\n\nA federal judge issued an order in April pausing third-country removals of detainees who are not given a chance to pursue CAT relief. With its Monday order, the Supreme Court lifted that order. The decision is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable, wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a dissent.\n\nApparently, the Court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in far-flung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a District Court exceeded its remedial powers, she added.\n\nHow Trumps immigration policies are faring at the Supreme Court\n\nThis is not the first time the Supreme Court has, on an emergency basis, allowed a controversial Trump immigration policy to take effect.\n\nIn April, the justices ruled unanimously that the government could deport alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, so long as the detainees receive notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n\nWeeks later, U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy cited that high court ruling in the context of third-country removals. Seeking CAT relief is a small modicum of process [that] is mandated by the Constitution, he wrote. He issued a preliminary injunction barring DHS from deporting immigrant detainees to third countries without first allowing them to raise a fear of torture or persecution.\n\nThat injunction, the Trump administration told the justices, harms its ability to remove some of the worst of the worst illegal aliens. Congress, the administration argued, has delegated the CAT relief process entirely to the Executive Branch.\n\nPlaintiffs responded that the injunction merely gives them the right to pursue basic due process.\n\nThe injunction does not stop Defendants from executing removal orders to third countries, the plaintiffs argued in a brief. It simply requires Defendants to comply with the law when carrying them out.\n\nThere is also clear evidence that the Trump administration hasnt been complying with Judge Murphys order.\n\nIn early May, the government was in the process of deporting Laotian, Vietnamese, and Filipino detainees to Libya when the judge blocked it with an emergency restraining order. Two weeks later, reports emerged that the government had deported a half dozen men  of various nationalities, and all convicted of serious crimes  to South Sudan.\n\nJudge Murphy ordered DHS to maintain custody and control of the men so they could be returned if the Court finds that such removals were unlawful.\n\nThe men are now being held on a U.S. military base in Djibouti, in a converted shipping container, under the care of 11 federal immigration officers, according to court documents. One imminent consequence of the Monday order is that the men will likely now be sent to a South Sudan that recently appeared to be on the brink of civil war.\n\nDiplomatic assurances dont satisfy the Convention Against Torture, says Scott Roehm, director of global policy and advocacy at the Center for Victims of Torture.\n\nTheres no recourse if [the assurances] are breached; theres no accountability for a country that breaches them. Theyre often sought from countries that are systematic violators of the prohibition on torture, he adds.\n\nOngoing legal challenges\n\nTrump administration officials cheered the Monday ruling.\n\nDHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them, the agencys assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement on Monday. Fire up the deportation planes.\n\nWhile the administration can resume deporting immigrant detainees to certain countries with minimal due process, the legal challenge to the policy will continue as well.\n\nMondays order also represents another significant emergency ruling from the justices, and another one siding with the Trump administration. In addition to this case and the Alien Enemies Act, the Supreme Court has also allowed the administration to revoke temporary protected status for roughly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants.\n\nCombined with the evidence of Trump administration defiance of court orders in this case, the Supreme Court order breaks new and troubling ground, legal experts say.\n\nThe absence of any admonishment or even mention of the fact that the government defied a federal court order twice is pretty profound, says Professor Sherman-Stokes. It practically invites future defiance whenever the government doesnt like what a federal court judge says."

        "content": "Migrants deported from U.S. to Salvadoran prison remain under U.S. control\n\ntoggle caption Alex Brandon/AP\n\nWASHINGTON  The government of El Salvador has acknowledged to United Nations investigators that the Trump administration maintains control of the Venezuelan men who were deported from the U.S. to a notorious Salvadoran prison, contradicting public statements by officials in both countries.\n\nThe revelation was contained in court filings Monday by lawyers for more than 100 migrants who are seeking to challenge their deportations to El Salvador's mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.\n\nThe case is among several challenging President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\n\"In this context, the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities,\" Salvadoran officials wrote in response to queries from the unit of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The U.N. group has been looking into the fate of the men who were sent to El Salvador from the United States in mid-March, even after a U.S. judge had ordered the planes that were carrying them to be turned around.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that it is powerless to return the men, noting that they are beyond the reach of U.S. courts and no longer have access to due process rights or other U.S. constitutional guarantees.\n\nBut lawyers for the migrants said the U.N. report shows otherwise.\n\n\"El Salvador has confirmed what we and everyone else understood: it is the United States that controls what happens to the Venezuelans languishing at CECOT. Remarkably the U.S. government didn't provide this information to us or the court,\" American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email.\n\nSkye Perryman, CEO and president of Democracy Forward, said the documents show \"that the administration has not been honest with the court or the American people.\" The ACLU and Democracy Forward are both representing the migrants.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. White House and Homeland Security Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe administration in March agreed to pay $6 million for El Salvador to house 300 migrants. The deal sparked immediate controversy when Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to quickly remove men it has accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a related case, the administration mistakenly sent Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the same prison, despite a judge's order prohibiting the Maryland man from being sent to El Salvador.\n\nThe administration initially resisted court orders to bring him back to the U.S., saying he was no longer in American custody. Eventually, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S., where he now faces criminal charges of human smuggling while legal battles continue.\n\nLast month, a coalition of immigrant rights groups sued to invalidate the prison deal with El Salvador, arguing that the arrangement to move migrant detainees outside the reach of U.S. courts violates the Constitution."

Last year, then-Vice President Kamala Harris spoke.\n\nWe intentionally curate a space that allows leaders to preserve, build and reimagine how we can collectively increase economic opportunity to thrive, said Alphonso David, CEO of the GBEF.\n\nSecond half shift\n\nWhile many Black Americans express economic anxiety, the data is less clear.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, according to Federal Reserve data, the median weekly salary for Black workers was $1,192 a 5% increase year over year. Black unemployment stood at 6% in the most recent jobs report, a historically low number, but still higher than the national average of 4.2%.\n\nHowever, the data doesnt appear to fully reflect the sentiment for many Black Americans who are concerned about the political, cultural and economic shifts that have taken place since President Donald Trumps election.\n\nNever let a good crisis go to waste, said John Hope Bryant, founder and CEO of Operation Hope, one of the nations largest non-profits focused on financial education and empowerment.\n\nBryant said he sees the concerns of Black Americans as an opportunity in the second half of 2025.\n\nThis president has done something that hasnt been done since the 1960s, which is unify Black America. Wealth was created in the early 20th century because Blacks were forced to work together. But instead of Black Lives Matter, lets make Black capitalist matter, he said.\n\nPastor Jamal Bryant of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church has galvanized Black consumers with an organized boycott of Target that began in February in response to the retailers decision to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nBryant said he is in discussions with Target but is ready to organize a longer-term boycott if the retailer does not fulfill the promises it made to the Black community after the killing of George Floyd. He is urging Black Americans to use the estimated $2.1 trillion dollars in spending power forecast by 2026 to drive economic and political change.\n\nI would dare say that pocketbook protests are a revolutionary activity, said Bryant.\n\nI think we have to be very selective in light of the Big Ugly Bill that just passed and how it will adversely affect our community, he said, referencing Trumps megabill that passed through Congress this week.\n\nCelebrate and educate\n\nInvest Fest, an event that blends commerce and culture created by financially focused media company Earn Your Leisure kicks off in Atlanta in August.\n\nCo-CEOs Rashad Bilal and Troy Millings said the event will remain focused on financial literacy, but this year they are emphasizing the urgent need for education and entrepreneurship in technology.\n\nIts definitely now or never, the time is now, said Bilal.\n\nThe important thing this year is the way technology is going to disrupt a lot of career paths and the businesses, and we have to prepare for that, which is why AI is at the forefront of the conversation, crypto is at the forefront of the conversations, real estate as always and entrepreneurship, said Millings.\n\nNew this year is a partnership with venture capital firm Open Opportunity and a pitch competition where an entrepreneur can win $125,000 in funding to scale their business.\n\nWe need more businesses that can reach $100 million valuation to a $1 billion valuation, get on the stock market. The pathway to that 9 times out of 10 is technology, Bilal said.\n\nThe National Black MBA Association Conference in Houston in September will have a similar tone. The event is known for its career fair where the nations largest companies recruit as well as for networking and vibrant social activities.\n\nThis year, interim CEO Orlando Ashford is working to establish artificial intelligence education and financial literacy as pillars of the event.\n\nDoing business as usual is not an option, Ashford told CNBC. AI is something I literally refer to as a tsunami of change thats on its way. All of us will be forced to pivot in some ways as it relates to AI. Those of us that are out in front, that embrace it and leverage it actually can turn it into a tremendous and powerful opportunity. Those that wait and ignore it will be overtaken by the wave."

        "content": "In Texas, rescue crews continue the slow and difficult search for flooding victims\n\nIn the Texas Hill Country, crews continue the difficult task of searching for people killed in last week's flash flooding. Dozens were killed and dozens are missing. It's difficult and draining work.\n\nJUANA SUMMERS, HOST:\n\nAnd I'm Juana Summers in central Texas, where today saw more efforts to recover victims of last week's flooding. Scores of people are known to have died. Officials say they don't know how many are still missing. Many hundreds of emergency workers and volunteers are combing through mud, downed trees and debris along more than 60 miles of the Guadalupe River. NPR's Greg Allen reports it is a painstaking process that may take weeks.\n\nGREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Loyd Thornton has been involved in many other search and recovery efforts in the past, but few as challenging as this one.\n\nLOYD THORNTON: There is debris fields up to 35 feet in the air trapped on huge cypress trees. And there are places to where campgrounds were totally wiped out, washed downstream and totally destroyed.\n\nALLEN: Thornton, a volunteer with Texas EquuSearch, has had a crew out searching debris piles along the river using an airboat.\n\nTHORNTON: We're climbing over small islands and debris fields, so we're able to go where a regular boat really has a hard time going.\n\nALLEN: Thornton has three other EquuSearch volunteers along in his boat. He says that gives him four sets of eyes scan the river and the piles of debris.\n\nTHORNTON: The boat and search - we're doing a lot of visual searching now, low speed, searching high up in the trees. Remember the water we saw in places was at least 35 feet high.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: All right, we ready? Let's do it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yup.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE STARTING)\n\nALLEN: Not far away, in the town of Hunt, Brad Phillip (ph) today was beginning the hard work of gutting his house. It's high up on the banks of the river but was still flooded out. He says the first thing he did after the flood was search the riverbanks for survivors or victims. One was recovered on an island just a few hundred yards from his house.\n\nBRAD PHILLIP: Someone got over there and flagged me down. I flagged a sheriff down. And within minutes, there was a Black Hawk and drones and people over there, and they were able to get a body out.\n\nALLEN: Today more victims were recovered near the town of Ingram. One of the crews involved in the recovery effort there is from Mexico. It's a nonprofit group that works with several Texas fire departments, Fundacion 911. Jorge Fuentes is with the group.\n\nJORGE FUENTES: Today they went to the river to do some groundwork on the river, and they did find a body just, like, 30 minutes ago.\n\nALLEN: Fuentes says it was one of two victims recovered from the side, an extremely large debris field.\n\nFUENTES: This area seems to be, like, on a bend. So lots of debris, lots of trash and some of the mobile homes that got that swept down the river got stuck in this area.\n\nALLEN: Fuentes' group is working with local fire departments. His members' expertise, especially in water searches, is proving invaluable to the search effort. Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice says the operation is still in what he calls the primary phase of the search mission. There are more than 60 miles of river to search, he says, and even with large crews, checking a single mile can take several hours.\n\nDALTON RICE: So what that means is they're running into a lot of technical challenges with terrain, with water, even potentially, you know, with weather, you know, in the rising fields.\n\nALLEN: Local officials in Kerrville have tried to discourage volunteers from self-deploying, as they've called it. That's caused some tension among locals who say it's kept out help that's badly needed. Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring says volunteers are welcome but asks them to register and coordinate with the local Salvation Army.\n\nJOE HERRING: We need focused and coordinated volunteers, not random people just showing up and doing what they do. We need to work together.\n\nALLEN: Just three days after the storm, it's clear that it's going to take some time to be sure that all the victims have been recovered.

        "content": "President Trump, right, talks with California Gov. Gavin Newsom after arriving on Air Force One at Los Angeles International Airport on Jan. 24.\n\nThe Trump administration could soon be forced to turn over a cache of documents, photos, internal reports and other evidence detailing the activities of the military in Southern California, a federal judge wrote Tuesday, signaling a possible procedural victory to the state in its fight to rein in thousands of troops under the presidents command.\n\nIf he approves expedited, limited discovery, Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer in San Francisco would likely also authorize California lawyers to depose key administration officials and might review questions about how long California National Guard troops remain under federal control.\n\n\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this article said the judge ordered the Trump administration to begin turning over evidence. The judge ordered the administration to respond to Californias request.\n\nBreyer issued an order directing the government to respond to the request for evidence by Wednesday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Department of Justice met that deadline, filing an 11-page rejoinder in opposition.\n\nPlaintiffs have lost this case, full stop, and this Court should read the writing on the wall and refuse to entertain the unbelievably broad and unnecessary requested discovery, including the request to depose two national security officials during defense operations, the governments response said.\n\nThe court fight has continued following a stinging loss for the state in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, when a panel struck down Breyers temporary restraining order that would have returned control of the troops to California leaders.\n\nWriting for the court, Judge Mark R. Bennett of Honolulu said the judiciary must broadly defer to the president to decide whether a rebellion was underway and if civilians protesting over immigration agents had sufficiently hampered deportations to warrant assistance from the National Guard or the Marines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett wrote that the president has the authority to take action under a statute that authorizes federalization of the National Guard when the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\n\nBut neither court has yet opined on Californias other major claim: that by aiding immigration raids, troops under Trumps command violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which forbids soldiers from enforcing civilian laws.\n\nShilpi Agarwal, legal director of the ACLU of Northern California, argued that the White House is abusing the post-Civil War law  known in legal jargon as the PCA  by having soldiers support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isnt a dispute that what the National Guard is doing right now is prohibited by the PCA  legally it absolutely has to be, Agarwal said. Going out with ICE officers into the community and playing a role in individual ICE raids really feels like what the Posse Comitatus Act was designed to prohibit.\n\nIn his June 12 order, Breyer wrote that such a claim was premature, saying that there was not yet sufficient evidence to weigh whether that law had been broken.\n\nThe 9th Circuit agreed.\n\nAlthough we hold that the President likely has authority to federalize the National Guard, nothing in our decision addresses the nature of the activities in which the federalized National Guard may engage, Bennett wrote. Before the district court, Plaintiffs argued that certain uses of the National Guard would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. ... We express no opinion on it.\n\nNow, California is seeking permission to compel that evidence from the government, as well as to depose figures including Ernesto Santacruz, Jr., the director of the ICE field office in L.A., and Maj. Gen. Niave F. Knell, who heads operations for the Army department in charge of homeland defense.\n\nWith few exceptions, such evidence would immediately become public, another win for Californians, Agarwal said.\n\nAs the facts are further developed in this case, I think it will become more abundantly clear to everyone how little this invocation of the National Guard was based on, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its Monday briefing, the Trump administration argued that troops were merely performing a protective function, not enforcing the law.\n\nNothing in the preliminary injunction record plausibly supports a claim that the Guard and Marines are engaged in execution of federal laws rather than efforts to protect the personnel and property used in the execution of federal laws, the Justice Departments motion said.\n\nThe federal government also claimed that even if troops were enforcing the law, that would not violate the Posse Comitatus Act  and if it did, the Northern District of California would have only limited authority to rule on it.\n\nGiven the Ninth Circuits finding, it would be illogical to hold that, although the President can call up the National Guard when he is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States, the Guard, once federalized, is forbidden from execut[ing] the laws, the motion said.\n\nFor Agarwal and other civil liberties experts, the next few weeks will be crucial.\n\nTheres this atmospheric Rubicon we have crossed when we say based on vandalism and people throwing things at cars, that can be justification for military roaming our streets, the lawyer said. There was more unrest when the Lakers won the Championship."

        "content": "Zohran Mamdani is a stylish, millennial, African-born Muslim with a Hollywood pedigree who just won the Democratic primary in the New York City mayors race.\n\nIf he sounds like Donald Trumps worst nightmare, he just might be. But hes also a lot like him.\n\nTheyre both charismatic leaders who have bucked their parties, tapped into the current political ethos that eschews traditional loyalties and by doing so, made themselves popular enough with fed-up voters to win elections when  to many in the political elite  they seem exactly like the kind of candidate who shouldnt be able to get their grandmothers vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking-class people want somebody who really takes on the status quo, who pushes an economic populist agenda and convinces them that somethings going to change, Lorena Gonzalez told me.\n\nShes the head of the California Labor Federation, which represents unions, and even shes fed up with Democrats.\n\nThere are days that Im like, why am I still in this party? she said. When I see them cozy up to tech, when I see this abundance issue that streamlines worker protections, when I see this fascination with billionaires and this acquiescing to not taxing billionaires and not doing anything about rent control, you know, theres a point where Im like, come on, grow some b, go decide who youre for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, as Trump put it in a social media post after Mamdanis win, Yes, this is a big moment in the History of our Country!\n\nVoices Chabria: How conflict with Iran could supercharge Trumps domestic agenda With a shaky ceasefire betwen Iran and Israel, many Americans are approaching the Fourth of July with a sense of trepidation, if not outright fear.\n\nTrump is right, words that I dont often say  Mamdanis victory may signal something deeper than a lone mayors race on the East Coast. People  both on the left and the right  crave authenticity, and want someone to believe in, be it an orange-hued boomer or a brown-skinned hipster.\n\nThe Democrats, as political strategist Mike Madrid put it, are having their own Tea Party moment, when populist anger eats the old guard, as it did beginning in 2007 when the far-right of the Republican party began its now-successful takeover. Trump was never the impetus of the partys swing to the fringe, he just capitalized on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is just a populist revolt of the Democratic Party against the establishment base, Madrid said.\n\nTheres been ad nauseam amounts of pontificating about the current state of the Democratic party. Should it go more centrist? Should it embrace the progressive end? But the truth is the voters have already decided. They do indeed want lower grocery prices, as Trump promised but failed to deliver. But they also want democracy to not crumble. And they want to buy a house, and maybe not have their neighbors deported. But really, in that order.\n\nAnd they dont trust many, if not most, of the current Democrats in office to deliver. Like Republicans before them, they want outsiders (Mamdani, 33, is serving in the state Assembly), or at least someone who can sound like one.\n\nGonzalez spends a lot of time talking to voters and she said left and right, Democrat and Republican, they see few differences remaining between the two parties, and are tired of voting for career politicians who havent delivered on economic issues.\n\nMamdani, whose mother is the film director Mira Nair (and who once rapped under the name Young Cardamom), campaigned on a New York you can afford. That included freezing payments on rent-controlled apartments, building new affordable housing with union labor, making both transit and child care free and  you guessed it  cheaper groceries. Whether he delivers or not, those were messages that a broad swath of New Yorkers, struggling like all of us with the cost of living, wanted to hear.\n\nAnd he delivered them not just with credibility, but with an entertainment value that nods to his moms influence: hamming it up Bollywood style for the South Asian aunties, walking the length of Manhattan to talk with people, jumping in the Atlantic ocean in a suit with a skinny tie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharisma and chutzpah.\n\nWhich, of course, is how Trump made his own rise, promising, with showman verve, to be the voice of the toiling voiceless who increasingly are in danger of becoming the working poor. Yes, he is a con man who is clearly for the rich. But still, he knows how to deliver a line to his base: Theyre eating the cats. Theyre eating the dogs.\n\nThat may be the biggest lesson for California, where we will soon be voting for a new governor from a crowded field  of establishment candidates. Even Kamala Harris, maybe especially Harris, fits that insider image, and certainly Gavin Newsom, despite zigzagging from centrist to pugilist, cant forward his presidential ambitions as anything but old-guard.\n\nWhat makes someone like Zohran so compelling, is even if you dont agree with him on everything, which few voters do, you understand that he believes it and that you know where hes coming from, said Amanda Litman, the co-founder and executive director of Run for Something, a PAC that recruits young progressives to run for office.\n\nI think thats the distinction between him and say someone like Gavin Newsom, which is, like, does Gavin believe what he says? Does he buy his own bull? Its sort of unclear, Litman added.\n\nThe anger of voters is strikingly clear, though, especially for ones who have for so long been loyal to Democrats. A new Pew analysis out this week found that about 20% of the Republican base is now nonwhite, nearly doubling what it was in 2016. Republicans have made gains with Black voters, Asian voters and Trump drew nearly half of Latino voters. Ouch.\n\nOne of the real challenges for the Democrats is two central pieces of the orthodoxy has been that they are the party of the working class and that they are the party of nonwhite voters, Madrid said. Both of those are increasingly proving untrue, and the question then becomes, well, how do you get them back? The way you get them back is by having some sort of economic populist policy framework.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoices Chabria: The secret police are everywhere. Do they really need the masks? Federal authorities are increasingly hiding their identities, refusing to answer basic questions about their affiliations and deceiving the public to make arrests.\n\nLitman said that the way to capture voters is by running new candidates, the kind who dont come with history  and baggage. In the 36 hours after Mamdani was elected, her organization had 1,100 people sign up to learn more about how to run for office themselves, she said. Its the biggest spike since the inauguration, and it shows that voters arent disinterested in democracy, but alienated from the existing options.\n\nThe establishment is not unbeatable. Theyre only unchallenged, Litman said. And I think the more that the Democratic Party establishment, as much as it exists, can understand that the people and the playbooks that got us here will not be the people and playbooks that get us out of it, the better off well be.\n\nSo maybe there are more Mamdanis out there, waiting to lead the way. If Democrats are looking for advice, Trump may have offered the best Ive seen in a while  highlighting the insider/outsider Democrats who have, like Mamdani, made their name by rattling the establishment.\n\nI have an idea for the Democrats to bring them back into play, he wrote on social media. After years of being left out in the cold, including suffering one of the Greatest Losses in History, the 2024 Presidential Election, the Democrats should nominate Low IQ Candidate, Jasmine Crockett, for President, and AOC+3 should be, respectively, Vice President, and three High Level Members of the Cabinet  Added together with our future Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani and our Country is really SCREWED!\n\nOr not.\n\nWouldnt that be a slate?"

        "content": "CNN \n\nFor all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs tweets.\n\nThe wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.\n\nThe judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.\n\nAt trial, it will be a jurys job to determine if the statements were made with actual malice  a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth  and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.\n\nFox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasnt come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.\n\nHeres a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.\n\nBroadcast 1: Bartiromo interviews Powell\n\nMaria Bartiromo is involved in three broadcasts that Dominion says were defamatory.

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Why do the girls of Girls act that way? Thats the question underlying five years of baffled cultural responses to Lena Dunhams epic of questionable decisions, cruelty, narcissism, and grace. Girls has never given a straightforward answer to the question. Despite unflinching confessional dialogue and occasional backstory development and sharp cultural satire, Hannah Horvath and her friends still have an air of Athena, sprung into existence fully formed. Asking why these girls spill drinks and impulsively marry and vomit off of bunkbeds is like asking why anyone exists at all.\n\nThis has made Girls unusual in a cultural landscape where the tragic flashback is the go-to decoder of individual motivation. To take two recent examples from HBO, The Young Pope connected Pope Piouss childhood abandonment to his adult torment, and Westworlds so-called key insight was that to be human is to remember suffering. In society more broadly, ongoing dialogues about trauma, triggering, and privilegedialogues that Dunham often wades into as a public figureinsist that personal history needs to be taken as seriously as present conduct does.\n\nOn Girls, parental issues occasionally surfaceJessas flaky dad, Hannahs closeted one, Marnies controlling momand brain chemistry came to the fore in Hannahs OCD plot line. But sometimes it has seemed like the show wants to satirize the notion of explaining character through trauma. Once, Hannah recalled telling her mom that her babysitter touched her vagina at age 3but added that she had probably been lying at it. At the Iowa Writers Workshop, her peers insisted her short story about violent sex must have been nonfiction from an abusive past; the joke was that it actually reflected her adventuresome present: the time that I took a couple Quaaludes and asked my boyfriend to punch me in the chest.\n\nThis weeks sure-to-be-provocative episode American Bitchposted to online platforms now and airing on HBO Sunday nightsharpened the shows point of view on psychological cause and effect. In it, Hannah visits with a famous author, Chuck Palmer (Matthew Rhys), after writing an essay about accusations that hed serially preyed on college-aged female fans. Chuck makes his case for innocence, Hannah relates some details from her past, and the two seem to come to an understandingand then Chuck takes his penis out and presses it against Hannah. Its a story of personal monstrousness and trauma, but its also a story about a system: a gender dynamic that ensures a common experience of degradation for women, whether in their pasts or in the present.\n\nChuck Palmer has a surprising amount in common with Hannah. His fussiness hints at OCD. He proposes that writers need stories more than anything else, echoing Hannahs experiences-at-all-cost outlook throughout Girls. The two bond over their love of Philip Roth, agreeing that you cant let politics dictate what you read or who you fuck (Chucks words). And most tellingly, Chuck professes to want to understand the person hes talking to but constantly interrupts with his own observationsperhaps a sexist tic, but also a narcissistic one plenty familiar to Girls viewers. In all of these things, Dunham may be sketching some ideas about the intrinsic traits that make a writer.\n\nBut most of their conversation is a clash of biographies. Chuck emphasizes his loneliness, his daughters depression, his ex-wifes hostility, and the sadness of book-tour life. When Hannah suggests an inappropriate power balance in him hooking up with girls on the road, Chuck shoots back that the real imbalance is that she looks like a Victorias Secret model and I didnt lose my virginity till I was 25 and on Accutane. He is the victim in this reading. The women complaining online are exploiting his fame and desperation as well as the power of the internet to amplify harmful claims.\n\nIt appears that this version of events nearly persuades Hannah, who apologizes for having written something that upset Chuck. But the apology is colored by all the buttering-up that has come before. Chuck repeatedly tells her how smart he thinks she is. He gives her a signed copy of Roths When She Was Good. And he claims that he invited her over to try and correct his true error with his accusers: not pushing enough to get to know them as people. When he then asks questions about her life, Hannah giggles and blithely answers.\n\nBut during an earlier, tenser point in the conversation, Hannah relates a less happy bit of her history. In fifth grade, her English teacher Mr. Lasky took a liking to her based on her talent as a writer:\n\nHe liked me, he was impressed with me, I did like special creative writing, I wrote like a little novel or whatever. Sometimes, when he was talking to the class he would stand behind me and hed rub my neck. Sometimes hed rub my head, rustle my hair. And I didnt mind. It made me feel special. It made me feel like someone saw me and they knew that I was going to grow up and be really, really particular. It also made kids hate me and put lasagna in my fucking backpack, but thats a different story. Anyway, last year Im at a warehouse party in Bushwick, and this guy comes up to me and hes like, Horvath, we went to middle school together, East Lansing! And Im like, Oh my god, remember how crazy Mr. Laskys class was? He was basically trying to molest me. You know what this kid said? He looks at me in the middle of this fucking party like hes a judge, and he goes, Thats a very serious accusation Hannah. And he walked away. And there I am and Im just 11 again, and Im just getting my fucking neck rubbed. Because that stuff never goes away.\n\nIf this is Hannah Horvaths long-awaited revelation about her past, its a relatively mild one: no rape, no violence, just some neck rubbing in class. But the insidiousness of it is in how it fits a pattern of warped gender relations. Chuck is like Mr. Lanksy: an older, powerful man praising a younger womans intellectual talentsbut also tying that praise to flesh. Hannahs value as a writer and her value as a body were long ago swirled together by a gatekeeper, and Chuck did something very similar to the young would-be authors he had sex with. If they consented, what were they consenting to? A validation of their mind, or the notion that what really matters is their body?\n\nThe trauma here is not merely what happened, either. Its in how honest expressions of discomfort by women are met with hostility and invalidation by men on legalistic pretenses. Consent is hugely important, but the issue isnt entirely a legal one in this case. It is a moral one, a social one, and an emotional one. Hannah doesnt seem to want either Chuck or Mr. Lasky in jail. She just wants to tell the truth about a troubling, degrading dynamic, and she is toldboth by the guy at the Bushwick party and by Chuckthat she is wrong to do so.\n\nThe earlier trauma itself didnt create the new one.\n\nThe sick twist is that the trauma has now been amplified and reenacted on Hannah for speaking out. Chuck flatters her, convinces her hes no monster, and then unzips and thrusts against her without warning. For a moment, Hannah seems confused; for another moment, she seems to consider going along with itshe grabs him. Then she freaks out and screams at him.\n\nHe gives her an evil grin. All the respect he had previously paid her has been rendered a joke. His praise of her mind was foreplay to the reminder that what he really liked was her body. And in Hannahs moment of her considering whether to give infor the rush, the faux validation, and the avoidance of conflict that would come with saying yesshe was in the same impossible situation as so many women before her.\n\nAs a public figure, Lena Dunham has written a lot about trauma, especially about how a rape in early adulthood has had a concrete effect on her life over the years. But she also, recently, apologized for saying she wished she had had an abortion so as to help destigmatize the practicea very inartful expression of the idea that a person and their worldview is not merely a result of biography.\n\nGirls seems to be trying to reconcile the need to honor the past's influence on the present while recognizing that no individual's history is an island. Did the Mr. Lasky experience change Hannah forever? Maybe. He could be the reason why she wants to write stories that make people feel less alone than [she] did, the exact kind of story that brought her to Chucks apartment. But that earlier trauma, in itself, didnt create the new one she experienced in this episode. Nor was it, theoretically, necessary for Hannah to have gone through what she went through in order to care about Chuck's accusers.\n\nWhy is Chuck such a creep? Girls doesnt say that its because of any specific circumstance in his past. Its not just because hes what he calls a horny motherfucker. Its simply because he can be this way. Because he is successful and male, he can put women in spots like the one he put Hannah in. He can expect them to often consent, queasily or not. He can even expect that other men will tell the women not to complain about it later.\n\nWhat he cant expect anymore, Girls suggests, is for the women to actually remain silent. In the final moments of the episode, Hannah watches Chucks daughter play flute. She alternates her gaze between the girl and her father, perhaps weighing the implications of what just happened and what she should do about it. If Hannah writes about his actions, she may hurt him in a way that harms his daughter. But she keeps staring at the girl. She may well be one day put in a situation like the one Hannah was just put in. She may already have been.\n\nAs Hannah leaves, we see a handful of women walking the opposite direction up the sidewalk, and then turning to enter his building. It reads as symbolism: a nod to all of the women past and future who can relate to what Hannah just went through, as different as their individual backstories may be."

        "content": "Noel H., a vendor at an STG Logistics facility in Compton, hugs family after an ICE raid there.\n\nGiovanni Garcia pulled up to a dusty intersection in South Gate and scoped the scene. It was quiet, just folks walking home from work, but Garcia was among several people drawn there in hopes of bearing witness to one of the federal raids that have unfolded across Los Angeles County in recent days.\n\nJust minutes before, several Instagram accounts had posted alerts warning that white pickup trucks with green U.S. Customs and Border Protection markings had been seen near the intersection.\n\nWith friends loaded into his white Grand Cherokee and a large Mexican flag flying out of the sunroof, this was the sixth day in a row that Garcia, 28, had spent up to 10 hours following such alerts through South L.A.s immigrant-heavy neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFueled by sodas and snacks he picked up at a Northgate Market, Garcias goal, he said, was to catch Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other immigration agents in the act of detaining people on the street.\n\nSo far, it had been a fruitless chase.\n\nIve been doing this for six days. It sucks because I get these alerts and go, but I never make it in time, said Garcia, a Mexican American U.S. citizen who lives in South Central.\n\nMonitoring ICE activity has become a grim pastime for some Angelenos. Apps dedicated to the purpose have popped up, which combine with Citizen, Nextdoor, X and other platforms to create a firehose of unverified, user-generated information about federal movements and operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrying to keep up in real time can prove equally exhausting and frustrating. The reports sometimes turn out to be false, and immigration enforcers seem to strike and depart with swift precision, leaving the public little opportunity to respond.\n\nIts impossible to determine how many people are engaged in this Sisyphean chase. But they have become a frequent sight in recent days, as anger has grown in response to viral videos of swift and violent apprehensions. A Times reporter and photographer crisscrossed the southern half of L.A. County, encountering Garcia and other ICE chasers in hot pursuit of federal agents who constantly seemed one step ahead.\n\nGiovanni Garcia, 28, drives through South Gate with a Mexican flag. He spent six days trying to witness an ICE raid with little luck. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nA new notification popped up on Garcias Instagram feed Thursday afternoon: ICE agents had been spotted in a nondescript residential area of South Gate, a city of about 90,000 people, of which more than 40% are foreign-born, according to the U.S. census. So Garcia put his SUV in gear and sped over.\n\nHe and his crew were late again. They arrived on a corner about 15 minutes after witnesses say immigration agents with green bulletproof vests and gaiters over their faces had jumped out of vehicles, handcuffed and taken away a man who had sold flowers in front of a ranch-style house there for years.\n\nI keep doing this because theyre messing with my people, Garcia said. Its no longer about immigration. Trumps no longer targeting criminals; hes targeting Hispanics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was one of many such raids in South L.A. in recent days at homes, parks and businesses ranging from a car wash to grocery stores.\n\nThe people whisked away in incidents captured in photos and videos that bystanders shared online ran the gamut: One man plucked out of a diverse crowd for no discernible reason while walking in South Gate Park. Another handcuffed on the curb outside a Ross clothing store in Bell Gardens. Two men in Rosemead snatched from the parking lot of a bakery.\n\nWorkers at a Fashion Nova clothing warehouse in Vernon told The Times that ICE trucks had been spotted in the area and that they had heard agents planned to confront employees during a shift change.\n\nFrom senior citizens to children, nobody was safe from the federal enforcement effort.\n\nJasmyn Vasillio, 35, said she first became concerned when she saw on social media that ICE agents had raided a car wash in South Gate, then an hour later saw a post about the flower sellers apprehension.\n\nI knew that flower guy is always there and I live nearby so I drove right over, she said as she stood on the corner where he had been standing 20 minutes earlier. I think theyre just picking people up and leaving.\n\nIm just another frustrated person in L.A. that wants to see an end to this. Not all of us are criminals, said Manolo, who runs a candle-making business in Vernon. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 20-year-old Latino man who declined to provide his name out of fear of reprisal said that he has been doing everything he can to spread awareness of what immigration enforcement agents are doing in his South Gate neighborhood and across South L.A.\n\nIm a U.S. citizen, so Im good. Im worried about other people. Its been heartbreaking, he said as he streamed live from a street in South Gate where CBP agents had been spotted minutes before, according to posts he had seen on Instagram.\n\nTheyre here to work and being torn apart from their families, he said. Its sad. They came here for the American dream and this is what happens.\n\nTeenagers Emmanuel Segura and Jessy Villa said they have spent hours over the past week scrolling through social media and despairing at the seemingly endless stream of videos of people being aggressively detained. They felt helpless in the face of the crackdown, so they planned a protest in the heart of their own community.\n\nOn Thursday, they took to Atlantic Avenue and Firestone Boulevard in South Gate, where Villa waved a flag pole with both American and Mexican flags affixed to it. They were joined by more than 30 other protesters who chanted slogans and hoisted anti-ICE posters. Drivers honked in support as they passed by.\n\nJessy Villa, 14, protests the recent ICE raids in the Southland at Atlantic Avenue and Firestone Boulevard in South Gate. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts kind of scary. Theyre taking anyone at this point. I just saw that ICE went to a car wash and took two people. And those are hard-working people  they are not criminals, Segura, a 15-year-old South Gate resident, said. So we planned the protest to go against ICE, Trump and his administration.\n\nVilla, 14, lives in nearby Lynwood, where he says everyone he knows is terrified they or someone they care about will be the next person swept up in an ICE raid.\n\nThe streets are empty. Nobody wants to come outside. And kids dont want to go to school, especially kids who migrated here, Villa said. Theyre scared going to school in the morning, and worried theyll come home and find out their parents were deported.\n\nCalifornia How L.A. law enforcement got pulled into the fight over Trumps immigration crackdown The deployment of LAPD officers and L.A. County sheriffs deputies in response to protests over federal immigration actions has led to several viral incidents and raised questions about the role of local law enforcement in quelling the unrest.\n\nFive miles away in Vernon, Manolo stood Thursday morning on the loading dock of the candle-making business he owns as employees loaded boxes of candles into the back of a black SUV. He said he has been following news and rumors of the raids online, and that the fear generated by them and the protests in response have been devastating for his company and other small businesses.\n\nEverybodys worried about it, Manolo said, recounting how he had heard that earlier that day ICE had raided a business two doors over from his. His company received zero calls for orders Thursday morning, down from the 50 to 60 it typically receives per day. If the immigration raids and protests havent wound down by the end of the month, he said he might have to shut down his business.\n\nFamily members of STG Logistics employees wait to hear word of their relatives whereabouts after an ICE raid at the companys facility in Compton. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis whole snatching people on the street  they have you on the floor in handcuffs, traumatize you, why? It makes me nervous, of course, said Manolo, a U.S. citizen who moved to the U.S. from Guatemala 33 years ago and declined to give his last name out of fear he and his company could be targeted by law enforcement.\n\nAnd its not just that, its affecting businesses, its affecting peoples lives. It affects the economy, law enforcement. It affects your daily routine. Whens it going to end?"

        "content": "Ive been studying the history of American conservatism full time since 1997almost 20 years now. Ive read almost every major book on the subject. I thought I knew what I was talking about. Then along comes Donald Trump to scramble the whole goddamned script.\n\nNow, historians must begin to consider alternate genealogies of the American right: lineages for the orange-haired monster that no one saw coming. Our received narrative of the movement encompassed by Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckley and Strom Thurmond and Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan just doesnt cut it any longer. Ive done my best to begin the workthinking through, for instance, Trumpisms connection to fascism, a political tradition not heretofore considered all that relevant in the American context. Other bodies, however, are buried closer to home.\n\nNo history of modern conservatism Im aware of finds much significance in the 22,000 Nazi sympathizers who rallied for Hitler at Madison Square Garden in February 1939, presided over by a giant banner of General George Washington that stretched almost all the way to the second deck, capped off by a menacing eagle insignia. Nor the now-infamous Ku Klux Klan march through the streets of Queens in 1927, when The New York Times reported 1,000 Klansmen and 100 policemen staged a free-for-all, in which according to one contemporary news report all the individuals arrested were wearing Klan attire, and that one of those arrestees was Donald Trumps own father.\n\nIn the specter of the sons likely ascension as Republican nominee, however, such events gather significance. Consider the subsequent history of Fred Trumps career as a developer of middle-class housing in the outer boroughs of New York City. We now know Fred Trump was notorious enough a racist to draw the attention of Woody Guthrie, who wrote a song about him in the 1950s: I suppose/ Old Man Trump knows/ Just how much/ Racial Hate/ he stirred up/ In the bloodpot of human hearts/ When he drawed/ That color line/ Here at his/ Eighteen hundred family project.\n\nTwenty years laterby which time he had brought his son in as his apprenticethe hate Old Man Trump stirred in the bloodpot of human hearts became a matter of legal record, when the United States Justice Department sued Trump pre et fils for violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 in operating 39 buildings they owned. Testifying in his own defense, young Donald (who would soon be seen around town in a chauffeured limousine with a license plate reading DJT), testified that he was unfamiliar with the landmark law. As the evidence in the federal case against the Trump organization became close to incontrovertible, he told the press the suit was a conspiracy to force them to rent to welfare recipients, a form of reverse discrimination. This proud and open refusal to rent to welfare recipientswhom he said contribute to the detriment of tenants who have, for many years, lived in these buildings, raised families in them, and who plan to live therewas Donald Trumps defense against racism.\n\nIt is in this saga that we locate the formation of Donald Trumps mature political vision of the world, in continuity with Americas racist and nativist heyday of the 1920s, and within the context of a cultural world much more familiar to us: New York in the 1970s, that raging cauldron of skyrocketing violent crime, subway trains slathered with graffiti, and a fiscal crisis so dire that even police were laid off in massthen the laid off cops blocked the Brooklyn Bridge, deflating car tires, and yanking keys from car ignitions.\n\nThink of Trump coming of age in the New York of the 1977 blackout, the search for the Son of Sam, and Howard Cosell barking out Ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning during game two of the World Series at Yankee stadium as a helicopter hovered over a five-alarm fire at an abandoned elementary school (40 percent of buildings in the Bronx were destroyed by the end of the 1970s, mostly via arsonoften torched by landlords seeking insurance windfalls).\n\nThink of Trump learning about the ins and outs of public life in this New York, a city of a frightened white outer-borough middle-class poised between fight or flight, in which real estate was everywhere and always a battleground, when the politics of race and crime bore all the intensity of civil war.\n\nIn The Invisible Bridge I wrote about what it was like in this New York in 1974, the summer when the federal lawsuit against the Trumps was approaching its climax, the summer when a controversial new movie began packing theaters across the five boroughs.\n\nDeath Wish starred a then-obscure Charles Bronson as a New York City architect who used to be liberal, until his daughter was raped and his wife murdered. His son-in-law pronounces defeat: Theres nothing we can do to stop it. Nothing but cut and run. The architect, by contrast, learns to shoot a gunin an Old West ghost townso he can start mowing down muggers at point-blank range. He soon cuts the citys murder rate in half, and wins a spot on the cover of Time. Liberal reviewers registered their disgust: The Timess Vincent Canby called it a bird-brained movie to cheer the hearts of the far-right wing, then, 10 days later, branded Bronson a circus bear. Time called it meretricious, brazen, and hysterical. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times labeled it fascist. But in the real-life New York City, where the murder rate had doubled in 10 years, and where a psychiatrist published a Times op-ed bragging about the violence he had prevented by leveling a pistol that he kept never far from my reach while I attend to patients in my mid-Manhattan office, each onscreen vigilante act won ovations from grateful fanssometimes standing ovations.\n\nTwo years later came an even darker, and considerably more critical, portrait of New York Citys escalating culture of vigilantism. In Taxi Driver, a deranged Vietnam veteran speaks what must have been the unspoken inner monologue of any number of real-life New Yorkers who felt trapped in an urban sewer: Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. Pistol in hand, he rehearses his revenge in the mirror: Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it any more. A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up.\n\nWhen, around that time, Wall Street Journal columnist Irving Kristol coined the phrase a neoconservative is a liberal whos been mugged by realitya bowdlerization of the older adage a conservative is a liberal whos been muggedhe probably didnt have Charles Bronson in mind, let alone taxi driver Travis Bickle. Nonetheless the politics is all of a piece. Charles Bronson conservatism, Travis Bickle conservatism, the conservatism of avenging angels protecting white innocence in a liberal metropolis gone mad: this is New York Citys unique contribution to the history of conservatism in America, an ideological tradition heretofore unrecognized in the historical literature. But without it, we cannot understand the rise of Donald Trump.\n\nTrumps political debut, after all, came in response to a mugging. Following the infamous attack on a female jogger in Central Park, Trump purchased full pages in four New York newspapers demanding, Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police! All the hallmarks of his present crusade against political correctness were in evidence, such as the harkening to that bygone day when men were men, cops were cops, and punks were punks. He concluded: I miss the feeling of security New Yorks finest once gave the citizens of this City. As I previously reported, these same police straight-jacketed by liberal timorousness had already coerced the rape suspects into confessions later proven to be false.\n\nThats N.Y.C.s avenging-angel conservatism in a nutshell. And now that Trump is gliding toward an expected landslide in the New York primary on Tuesday, April 19, we must begin the work of excavating its history.\n\nWe might start with William F. Buckleythough other scholars can surely date it back further. The National Review editors quixotic campaign for New York mayor in 1965 is best remembered for a self-effacing quip. (What will you do if you win? he was asked. Demand a recount.) Buckley himself is now celebrated as the genteel warrior of the conservatism of a more civilized age: The New York Times, upon his death in 2008, averred of that 1965 race, He injected a rare degree of lofty oratory into city politics.\n\nWhat he also injected was an unprecedented reactionary thuggishness. Like his idea to undertake to quarantine all addicts, even as smallpox carriers would be quarantined during a plague. Or relocating chronic welfare cases outside the city limitsin what his critics described as concentration camps for the poor. The campaign might have begun as a lark. He received hardly more than 10 percent of the vote. But in a harbinger of things to come, he finished second in some Catholic neighborhoods in Queens. Cops wore Buckley For Mayor buttons. When the elections winner, the very liberal John Lindsay, campaigned in those same neighborhoods, young white men waved Support your Local Police placards in his face.\n\nThe stage was set, in 1966, for the next New York City law-and-order melodrama. Lindsay, now mayor, fulfilled a campaign pledge by establishing a Civilian Complaint Review Board to protect citizens from abusive cops, the better to restore trust in a police force whose utter rot was the subject that year of a bestselling book about a cop named Frank Serpico, whose reward for refusing to break the law was an attempt by fellow cops on his life.\n\nThe president of the Patrolmens Benevolent Association responded to Mayor Lindsays new board: I am sick and tired of giving in to minority groups and their gripes and their shouting. After a Brooklyn riot in which cops had been ordered not to use their nightsticks, the PBA got 96,888 signatures to put a referendum on the November ballot to dissolve the review board (they only needed 25,000). Their TV commercials brayed, Trump-like, Bronson-like, The addict, the criminal, the hoodlum: only the policeman stands between you and him. Buckleywho had orated on the campaign trail, We need a much larger police force, enjoined to lust after the apprehension of criminals, unencumbered by any such political irons as civilian review boardsmight only have received 10 percent of the vote. But 12 months later, the anti-CCRB referendum won 63 percent of the popular vote. Even Jews, who were supposed to be liberal, opposed it 55 percent to 40 percent.\n\nTwo years later, George Wallace brought his independent presidential bid to Madison Square Garden. We need somemeanness, Wallace brayed. And he got it: police had to rescue black protesters from a mob that surrounded them and chanted, Kill em! The New Republic observed, Never again will you read about Berlin in the 30s without remembering this wild confrontation of two irrational forces.\n\nThe confrontation is the key: one of the things that makes New Yorks conservatism of avenging angels so feral is its proximity to so many damned left-wingers. Left-wingers like Mayor Lindsaywho only won reelection in 1969 because the white ethnic backlash vote was split between two candidates, one of whom, Mario Procaccino, helped popularize the phrase limousine liberal in describing Lindsay.\n\nIn 1971, Lindsay elected to build publicly subsidized housing in the Queens neighborhood of Forest Hills, partly upon the presumption that its largely Jewish population, only two and half decades on from the Holocaust, would be relatively free from racism of the Fred Trump sort. Apparently hizzoner wasnt paying attention to the growing following behind Rabbi Meir Kahane, the domestic terrorist who was another of New York Citys sui generis contributions to the history of the American right.\n\nVillage Voice columnist Jack Newfield reported from one of the mayors damage-control sessions at the Forest Hills Jewish Community Center, where Jews called Lindsay redneck names under the shadow of the Torah. The Voices Paul Cowan heard a picketer boast, If Lindsay ever gets to be president, Ill kill him. Ill do just what Oswald did to John Kennedy. His companion replied, You wont get the chance. Lindsay is going to get shot right here in New York.\n\nDonald Trump, 25 years old, was just then beginning his apprenticeship in his fathers real estate organization.\n\nHe made the acquaintance of Roy Cohn, who represented the family against the federal racial bias lawsuit, devising the defense that Fred Trump had no intention of excluding black tenants, just welfare recipients. Trump became a student of the legendarily reptilian thug who came to prominence as Joseph McCarthys lawyer. Long-time Trump-watcher Michael DAntonio has explained: Both were members of Le Club, a private hot spot where the rich and famous and social climbers could meet without suffering the presence of ordinary people. Writes DAntonio, Cohn modeled a style for Trump that was one part friendly gossip and one part menace. . . . Trump kept a photo of the glowering Cohn so he could show it to those who might be chilled by the idea that this man was his lawyer.\n\nIt was Cohn, indeed, who introduced Trump to the nearly-as-reptilian Roger Stone, the professional dirty trickster and sexual adventurer with the giant tattoo of Richard Nixon on his backand who, even though Trump has called him a stone-cold loser, has managed to hang on to a position of influence in the Trump presidential campaign. He certainly maintains an influence on Donald Trumps view of the world. When somebody screws you, Stone told a reporter, Screw em backbut a lot harder. Figures like Cohn and Stone represent another branch in the New York conservative tradition: flashy, hedonistic right-wing operatives who gargle with razor blades and wear their shiny silver three-piece suits like armor.\n\nNext comes an avenging angel named Ed Koch.\n\nA former liberal, Koch won his underdog mayoral victory in 1977 in a madcap electoral free-for-all whose tenor was set on the night of July 13, when a series of lightning strikes shut down transmissions lines, the city shuddered to black, and so much crime ensued that buses filled with men in chains shuttled from jailhouse to jailhouse in search of available cells.\n\nNeoconservative Midge Decter wrote in Commentary that it was like having been given a sudden glimpse into the foundations of ones house and seen, with horror, that it was utterly infested and rotting away. The supposedly liberal readership of The New York Times wrote letters to the editor like this one: The Puerto Ricans can go back to Puerto Rico. They belong there anyway, and if the blacks do not shape up they can go to the South.\n\nEd Koch was virtually unknown outside his Greenwich Village neighborhood, but with a pledge to restore the death penalty, his campaign took off like a rocket. Never mind that the New York mayor had no power over capital punishment. The people had spoken: a mere 25 percent opposed bringing back what New York Daily News called little hot squat.\n\nMeanwhile Koch berated the poverty pimps and povertitians holding a broke city hostage, demanded the abolition of the Board of Education (a lard barrel of waste), denounced alleged welfare fraud, decried the nuts on the left who dump on middle class values. He promised, too, to unwind New Yorks experiments with free college, generous welfare, and subsidized housing, which its cheerleaders on the left called socialism in one city.\n\nOne of those cheerleaders was the one-time front-runner in the race, the very liberal Congresswoman Bella Abzug. After the blackout riots, her campaign went into a tailspin; she didnt even make it into the runoff.\n\nAn underdog did instead: the young Mario Cuomo. He said, the death penalty cannot provide jobs for the poor. The electric chair cannot balance the budget. The electric chair cannot educate our children. The electric chair cannot give us a sound economy or save us from bankruptcy or even save my seventy-seven-year-old mother. And besides, he would add, America was better than that. Or was it? One time when he tried to make that same point, an old lady in Brooklyn spat in his face. Another time, someone stood up and cried, Kill them!\n\nKoch won, of course, and then served as New Yorks mayor for the next dozen years. Although to outer-borough reactionaries like state Senator Chris Mega of Brooklyn, he was just another liberal sellout on gun control. At a December 1984 press conference, Mega demanded to know: When will Mayor Koch provide the same level of protection to the citizens who ride the subways and pay their taxes that he enjoys surrounded by a phalanx of New Yorks finest, guns at the ready?\n\nThat particular press conference was called by the National Rifle Association in support of Bernhard Goetz, an electronics salesman from Kew Gardens, Queens, who shot five young men on a graffiti-encrusted subway car who, depending on whom you believed, were either preparing to mug him or aggressively panhandling for $5. Like the character played by Charles Bronson, Goetz made the cover of Time magazine. Celebratory bumper stickers bloomed: Ride With BernieHe Goetz Them. In a later interview he reflected, Travis Bickle-like, The guys I shot represented the failure of society. . . . Forget about their ever making a positive contribution to society. Its only a question of how much a price theyre going to cost. The solution is their mothers should have had an abortion.\n\nOne of Goetzs biggest backers was Bob Grant, who beginning on WMCA in 1970, and then on WOR (until he was fired in 1979 for saying the only reason a black woman got her job was that she passed the gynecological and pigmentation test), virtually invented right-wing talk radioand when you think about it, it hardly could have been invented anywhere else but New York. Grant won the first live radio interview with Goetz, in 1986, lamenting that he had not finished the job by killing them all.\n\nThree years later, after the assault in Central Park, Donald Trump offered his memorable argument to bring back little hot squat. What has happened is the complete breakdown of life as we know it. . . . How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS.\n\nIn 2011, Bob Grant, impressed with Donald Trumps campaign to force President Obama to produce his birth certificate, announced he had found his presidential candidate for 2012. Grant died in 2014, but two years later, his brand of vigilante conservatism has gone fully national. The wall Fred Trump sought to build in Queens in the early 1970s has been relocated 2,000 miles south. On Tuesday, Donald Trump will win a landslide in his home state. And somewhere, Bob Grant will be smiling.\n\nThis story first appeared on the Washington Spectator"

        "content": "Los Angeles-area leaders representing Asian American communities denounced the federal enforcement sweeps they say are terrorizing hardworking residents and families.\n\nAs federal immigration raids continue to upend life in Los Angeles, Asian American leaders are rallying their communities to raise their voices in support of Latinos, who have been the primary targets of the enforcement sweeps, warning that neighborhoods frequented by Asian immigrants could be next.\n\nOrganizers say many Asian immigrants have already been affected by the Trump administrations crackdown on immigrants working in the country without documentation. Dozens of Southeast Asian immigrants in Los Angeles and Orange counties whose deportation orders had been on indefinite hold have been detained after showing up for routine check-ins at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices, according to immigration attorneys and advocacy groups.\n\nIn recent months, a number of Cambodian, Laotian and Vietnamese immigrants whose deportation orders had been stayed  in some cases for decades  have been told that those orders will now be enforced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Asian immigrants being targeted are generally people who were convicted of a crime after arriving in the U.S., making them subject to deportation after their release from jail or prison. In most cases, ICE never followed through because the immigrants had lived in the U.S. long enough that their home countries no longer recognized them as citizens.\n\nOur community is much more silent, but we are being detained in really high numbers, said Connie Chung Joe, chief executive of Asian Americans Advancing Justice Southern California. Theres such a stigma and fear that, unlike the Latinx community that wants to fight and speak out about the injustices, our communitys first reaction is to go down and get more and more hidden.\n\nOn Thursday, more than a half-dozen leaders representing Thai, Japanese and South Asian communities held a news conference in Little Tokyo urging community members to stand together and denounce the federal action as an overreach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump came into office in January vowing to target violent criminals for deportation. But amid pressure to raise deportation numbers, administration officials in recent months have shifted their focus to farmworkers, landscapers, street vendors and other day laborers, many of whom have been working in the country for decades.\n\nWhile an estimated 79% of undocumented residents in L.A. County are natives of Mexico and Central America, Asian immigrants make up the second-largest group, constituting 16% of people in the county without legal authorization, according to the Migration Policy Institute . Across the U.S., Indians make up the third-largest group of undocumented residents, behind Mexicans and Salvadorans.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, the L.A. metropolitan area is home to the largest populations of Cambodian, Korean, Indonesian, Filipino, Thai and Vietnamese people in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, the highest-profile raids in Southern California have centered on Latino neighborhoods, targeting car washes, restaurants, home improvement stores, churches and other locales where undocumented residents gather and work.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado and Peter Gee of the Little Tokyo Service Center were among the speakers who denounced ICE raids during a news conference Thursday. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBut Asian businesses have not been immune. A raid outside a Home Depot in Hollywood happened near Thai Town, where organizers have seen ICE agents patrolling the streets. In late May, Department of Homeland Security agents raided a Los Angeles-area nightclub, arresting 36 people they said were Chinese and Taiwanese immigrants in the country without authorization.\n\nIn Little Bangladesh, immigration agents recently detained 16 people outside a grocery store, said Manjusha P. Kulkarni, executive director of AAPI Equity Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 community-based organizations.\n\nThey will come for us even more in the coming days and weeks, Kulkarni said. So we are only protected when were in solidarity with our fellow Angelenos.\n\nFrom June 1 to 10, at the start of the federal sweeps, ICE data show that 722 people were arrested in the Los Angeles region. The figures were obtained by the Deportation Data Project, a repository of enforcement data at UC Berkeley Law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Times analysis found that 69% of those arrested during that period had no criminal convictions. Nearly 48% were Mexican, 16% were from Guatemala and 8% from El Salvador.\n\nForty-seven of the 722 individuals detained  or about 6%  were from Asian countries.\n\nWe know the fear is widespread and it is deep, said Assemblymember Mike Fong, a Democrat whose district takes in Monterey Park and west San Gabriel Valley, areas with large Asian immigrant populations.\n\nCalifornia Faith leaders come together to defend immigrant communities amid federal raids Faith leaders from across the Los Angeles region marched to the Federal Building on Wednesday night, calling for an end to the federal immigration raids they say are tearing apart communities.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilmembers Nithya Raman and Ysabel Jurado spoke of the repercussions the raids were having on immigrant communities. Raman is Indian American, and Jurado is Filipino American.\n\nJurado said undocumented Filipinos make up a sizable portion of the regions caregivers, tending to elderly people and young children.\n\nTheir work reflects the deepest values of our communities: compassion, service and interdependence, Jurado said. Their labor is essential, and their humanity must be honored.\n\nJurado and Raman called on the federal government to end the raids.\n\nThis is such an important moment to speak out and to ensure that the Latino community does not feel alone, Raman said. I also want to make it clear to every single person who is Asian American, these arent just raids on others. Theyre raids on us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff writer Rachel Uranga contributed to this report."

        "content": "DOJ launches unusual lawsuit against entire federal district court in Maryland\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nRetired federal judge Andre Davis learned the Justice Department had decided to sue his former colleagues when he boarded a flight to Charlotte, N.C., to attend a judicial conference.\n\nHis fellow passengers included several of the district court's 15 judges, who now find themselves on the other end of an unusual court case.\n\n\"It's outrageous that they actually named individually in their official capacities all 15 judges on the court,\" said Davis. \"And so you have to ask yourself, 'What is going on here? What kind of performance? What was the audience for this?'\"\n\nDavis said what's going on is an attack on judicial independence, at a time when federal judges are facing a rise in threats of violence and impeachment simply for doing their jobs. But the Justice Department says it's trying to stop a case of judicial overreach. The case is likely to end up getting appealed to higher courts.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe dispute in Maryland began in May, when the chief judge there ordered a 48-hour pause in every case where an individual migrant had petitioned to try to block their removal from the U.S. with a habeas petition.\n\n\"The reason the court implemented it is because there have been so many requests for habeas petitions and so many people who are being subject to, to abrupt, precipitous deportation orders and courts need time to be able to consider these requests,\" said Emily Chertoff, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who closely follows immigration issues.\n\nHabeas corpus petitions are used by people trying to prevent unlawful imprisonment by petitioning a court to review the legality of their detention.\n\nLingering in the background is the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He's the Maryland man who was deported to El Salvador in what the Justice Department later called an \"administrative error.\" After weeks in a brutal prison, he's now back in the U.S., fighting criminal charges here.\n\nAccused of undermining executive branch\n\nRamping up immigration enforcement is one of the top priorities of the Trump administration. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the court order in Maryland was overreaching and undermined the executive branch, when the Justice and Homeland Security departments sued the federal court there last month.\n\n\"Like other government officials, judges sometimes violate the law,\" the Justice Department wrote in court papers last week. \"This case involves an extraordinary form of judicial interference in Executive prerogatives.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAndrew Arthur is a resident fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies who's criticized the order by the chief judge in Maryland. The center advocates for lower levels of immigration into the U.S.\n\n\"It's an aggressive move by the DOJ but arguably this is an aggressive move by the district court,\" Arthur said.\n\nArthur said lower court judges do not have jurisdiction to impose these kinds of temporary pauses on deportationsand that the DOJ argues in court papers that it tried to reach out to the body that oversees the federal courts before filing a lawsuit.\n\n\"Injunctive relief itself is supposed to be exceptional, and yet through its standing order the district court has made it not only mundane but automatic,\" he said.\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court limited courts' ability to impose universal injunctions when it issued an opinion last month in a case about birthright citizenship though the situation in Maryland concerns limited injunctions in response to individual habeas petitions, not nationwide orders.\n\nPrior lawsuits against court under Clinton\n\nIt's rare for the Justice Department to sue a federal court. But the Trump DOJ says it has happened before. Their court briefs cited a case during the Clinton administration, when then-U.S. attorney and now Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island.) sued the court in Rhode Island over a rule about issuing subpoenas to attorneys.\n\n\"It's not unprecedented for litigants to sue a judge in order to say the judge is taking an action and we think the judge's action is wrong and we want the judge's action to be stayed,\" said Chertoff, of Georgetown Law Center.\n\nMost of the time, it's the job of Justice Department lawyers to defend a judge who's being sued. But this time, it's the DOJ doing the suing, so the judges in Maryland have enlisted noted conservative lawyer Paul Clement to represent them.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe case has been moved out of Maryland, since the entire district court bench is a defendant. To avoid a conflict of interest, the court clerk is also recused from any administrative tasks related to the casebecause the DOJ is suing the clerk, too. Instead a deputy will handle any \"ministerial\" tasks.\n\nU.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who's based in Roanoke, Va., will be in charge. He was appointed to the bench by President Trump during his first term in office.\n\nFor Andre Davis, who served on both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the episode is part of a broader breakdown in civility and respect between the branches.\n\nTo respond, he and 50 other retired judges are working with a nonpartisan group called the Keep Our Republic's Article Three Coalition, referring to the article of the U.S. Constitution that empowered the judiciary branch.\n\n\"We have come together to raise our voice in unison to defend the rule of law, to push back against dangerous and unwarranted attacks against judges and against the judiciary in general, threats to disobey court orders, all of which truly undermine the rule of law and really, the foundations of our democracy,\" Davis said.\n\nLegal experts predicted the case against the Maryland judges could end up at the Supreme Court one day.\n\n"

        "content": "Hong Kong CNN \n\nChinas economy got off to a solid start in 2023, as consumers went on a spending spree after three years of strict pandemic restrictions ended.\n\nGross domestic product grew by 4.5% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday. That beat the estimate of 4% growth from a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nBut private investment barely budged and youth unemployment surged to the second highest level on record, indicating the countrys private sector employers are still wary about longer term prospects.\n\nConsumption posted the strongest rebound. Retail sales jumped 10.6% in March from a year earlier, the highest level of growth since June 2021. In the January to March months, retail sales grew 5.8%, mainly lifted by a surge in revenue from the catering service industry.\n\nThe combination of a steady uptick in consumer confidence as well as the still-incomplete release of pent-up demand suggest to us that the consumer-led recovery still has room to run, said Louise Loo, China lead economist for Oxford Economics.\n\nIndustrial production also showed a steady increase. It was up 3.9% in March, compared with 2.4% in the January-to-February period. (China usually combines its economic data for January and February to account for the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday.)\n\nCommuters during Beijing's morning rush hour in April 2023 Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nLast year, GDP expanded by just 3%, badly missing the official growth target of around 5.5%, as Beijings approach to stamping out the coronavirus wreaked havoc on supply chains and hammered consumer spending.\n\nAfter mass street protests gripped the country and local governments ran out of cash to pay huge Covid bills, authorities finally scrapped the zero-Covid policy in December. Following a brief period of disruption due to a Covid surge, the economy has started showing signs of recovery.\n\nLast month, an official gauge of non-manufacturing activity jumped to its highest level in more than a decade, suggesting the countrys crucial services sector was benefiting from a resurgence in consumer spending after the end of pandemic restrictions.\n\nAs the economic recovery gains traction, investment banks and international organizations have upgraded Chinas growth forecasts for this year. In its World Economic Outlook released last week, the International Monetary Fund said China is rebounding strongly following the reopening of its economy. The countrys GDP will grow 5.2% this year and 5.1% in 2024, it predicted.\n\nPrivate business retreat\n\nHowever, some analysts believe the strong growth reported in the first quarter was the product of backloading of economic activity from the fourth quarter of 2022, which was weighed down by pandemic restrictions and then a chaotic reopening.\n\nOur core view is that Chinas economy is deflationary, said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research, in a Tuesday research report.\n\nIf adjustments are made to account for the impact of delayed economic activity, GDP growth in the first quarter could have been just 2.6%, he said.\n\nSome key data released on Tuesday support this idea. For example, private investment was extremely weak.\n\nFixed asset investment by the private sector increased a mere 0.6% from January to March, indicating a lack of confidence among entrepreneurs. (State-led investment, meanwhile, advanced 10%.) Thats even worse than the 0.8% growth recorded in the January-to-February period.\n\nThe Chinese government has resorted to surprising measures to restore confidence among private entrepreneurs, but the campaign has inspired more nervousness than optimism.\n\nThe all-important property industry is also mired in a deep downturn. Investment in property declined 5.8% in the first quarter. Property sales by floor area decreased by 1.8%.\n\nThe domestic economy is recovering well, but the constraints of insufficient demand are still obvious, said Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the NBS, at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. Prices of industrial products are still falling, and enterprises are facing many difficulties in their profitability.\n\nYouth unemployment surges\n\nUnemployment continued to surge among the youth.\n\nThe jobless rate for 16- to 24-year-olds hit 19.6% in March, up for a third straight month. It was the second highest on record, only behind the 19.9% level reached in July 2022.\n\nThe high jobless rate among the youth suggests slack in the economy, Yeung said.\n\nBy June, there will be a new batch of graduates looking for jobs. The jobless condition could worsen further if Chinas economic momentum falters, he added.\n\nChinas education ministry has previously estimated that a record 11.6 million college graduates will be looking for jobs this year.\n\nAt last months meeting of the National Peoples Congress, the countrys rubber-stamp parliament, the government set a cautious growth plan for this year, with a GDP target of around 5% and a job creation target of 12 million."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "CNN \n\nOf the many dark gifts Showtimes eerie hit series Yellowjackets serves up for us, the juiciest this season is by far the music.\n\nThe show  which bounces between a troupe of teen soccer players trapped in the 1990s Canadian wilderness after a plane crash and the survivors corresponding adult selves in the present day  embraces nostalgia, incorporating long-cherished tunes from the tail end of last century, with staples from Tori Amos, early Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack, Veruca Salt and much more.\n\nIn Sundays episode of Yellowjackets, alt-rock queen Alanis Morissette will debut a version of the shows theme song, No Return, and has already released it as a single.\n\nOne of the most unexpected and successful uses of throwback music came in the first episode of Season 2 last month, when Warren Koles Jeff had a moment to himself in the car after an intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey)  during which he rocks out hard to Papa Roachs Last Resort (sure, the track actually came out in 2000, but that doesnt take away from its retro vibe).\n\nIn an interview with CNN, the shows music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that the Papa Roach song selection was scripted, and served as a perfect physical outlet for Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone in his garage.\n\nOther standout moments in the script, however, are hers to interpret, and Felder relishes the opportunity to match those moments with the right songs from the period.\n\nI re-immerse myself into the shows era and spirit of the times as I start to build my playlists for the show, she said. The main thing I try to keep in mind is to just stay true to the story and let it tell me what it might need musically.\n\nCase in point, from the same episode  the placement of Amoss signature track Cornflake Girl, off her groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album Under the Pink.\n\nThe song  which appropriately has the lyric Things are getting kind of gross just as teen Shauna (Sophie Nlisse) is about to ingest something unthinkable  came to mind pretty quickly as a possibility to Felder.\n\nI felt that Amoss lyrics could serve as a befitting launchpad for the first episodes ending  not only as a reflection of Young Shaunas state of mind, she noted, but also as a reflection of the past and present moods and mentalities lived out by the other Yellowjackets characters in Season 2.\n\nFelders work is challenging, in the sense that there is often an ideal wish-list selection for a song during a certain moment in each script, which then might change either due to something technical or because the needs of the scene evolve during production, as a result of many elements, including the actors performances.\n\n(From left): Sophie Nlisse, Courtney Eaton, Nia Sondaya, Alexa Barajas, Nuha Jes Izman and Mya Lowe in 'Yellowjackets.' Colin Bentley/SHOWTIME\n\nEveryone on the team always wants the best song-select possible to enhance the story, she said. When we get to post (production), the common question that comes up among us during the collaboration process is simply, Do we think we can beat this?\n\nDuring that collaborative process, Felder says she doesnt believe there is an exact roadmap into how to merge songs with any given scene or story.\n\nI always say, Let the picture tell you what it needs. (Kind of like the Wilderness I guess?)\n\nAnother moment that feels perfectly melded to the music playing is the now-infamous last supper scene from last weeks second episode, which boasts Radioheads Climbing By The Walls from their mindblowing 1995 album OK Computer on the soundtrack.\n\nThe song seems to refer to those unspeakable monsters that can live in ones head, Felder noted, referencing the strange collective hallucinations the group undergoes while cannibalizing one of their own. I cant think of a more perfect way to hauntingly accent (that) scene, a.k.a. the feast.\n\nTo drive home just how important music is to the specific ambient feel of Yellowjackets, one need look no further than the super creepy Season 2 trailer for the show, which features Florence + The Machines exceptional and haunting rendition of No Doubts timeless 1995 hit, Just A Girl.\n\nIm such a huge fan of Yellowjackets and this era of music, and this song especially had a huge impact on me growing up, so I was thrilled to be asked to interpret it in a deeply unsettling way for show, band frontwoman Florence Welch said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\nWe tried to really add some horror elements to this iconic song to fit the tone of the show. And as someone whos first musical love was pop punk and Gwen Stefani, it was a dream job.\n\nOf her collaboration with Yellowjackets, Morrisette, too, felt inspired by the show.\n\nI see parallels between Yellowjackets and my perspective while songwriting: the sheer intensity, that going for the jugular with no fear around going for the profane, Morissette said in a statement. Ive strived my entire career to support the empowerment of women and sensitives, and see the world through the female lens, and whats so wonderful about this show is that each character is allowed to be dynamic and complex as opposed to oversimplified, reduced versions of women. I feel honoured to be a part of the legacy of Yellowjackets."

        "content": "LOS ANGELES  Some Southern California communities are canceling or rescheduling July Fourth events as immigration arrests spread fear across the region.\n\nBut organizations that oppose President Donald Trumps immigration policies plan to proceed with protests in downtown Los Angeles, where large demonstrations last month sometimes turned violent, prompting Trump to call in the state National Guard and U.S. Marines over the governor's objections.\n\nThe city said it would postpone its annual Fourth of July block party in light of recent events affecting a portion of Downtown Los Angeles and the ongoing circumstances impacting the region.\n\nThe event is held each year in Gloria Molina Grand Park near City Hall and several federal buildings, including one now being used as a detention center that has been a focal point for demonstrations against raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nDuring a No Kings march on June 14, protesters fled from tear gas, pepper spray and less-lethal munitions fired by law enforcement officers, and large crowds were pushed away from federal buildings and into Grand Park, where demonstrators scrambled up a small hill to safety.\n\nMore than 1,618 people in Los Angeles have been arrested by the federal government since it began clamping down on residents without citizenship last month, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe detentions have spread fear across Southern California, where some 1.4 million people are estimated to live without full legal authorization, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nSeveral L.A.-based organizations said they will launch another round of protests Thursday near Grand Park, and a coalition of multifaith organizations, labor unions, activists and artists will hold a freedom car cruise and rally outside City Hall.\n\nLater, activists with the group Centro CSO will hold a march outside the federal courthouse, calling for charges to be dropped against Alejandro Orellana, who was arrested in connection with distributing face shields to suspected rioters.\"\n\nHe faces charges of conspiracy to commit civil disorder and aiding and abetting civil disorders. He was released on bond last month and has a preliminary hearing scheduled for Thursday afternoon.\n\nOn Friday, the local chapter of 50501, which organized the No Kings rally, will hold an all-day demonstration outside City Hall to demand an end to the occupation of Los Angeles by ICE, the National Guard and the Marines.\n\nThis isnt a celebration, the group said in a statement. Its a stand.\n\nSmaller communities throughout Los Angeles County with large immigrant populations are also rethinking Fourth of July celebrations. In East Los Angeles, a historically Latino area, the neighborhoods of Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights and El Sereno have postponed July Fourth festivities after several high-profile immigration arrests.\n\nFederal agents last month rammed and trapped a car carrying four U.S. citizens, including a man, woman and two children, in Boyle Heights. The Department of Homeland Security said its target was Christian Damian Cerno-Camacho, who was arrested in connection with punching an immigration officer.\n\nA lawyer representing Cerno-Camachos family said he is planning to file a lawsuit against the federal government.\n\nThis week, Boyle Heights activists shut down a bridge that links downtown Los Angeles to the small enclave and marched with mariachis to the site of another recent arrest.\n\nDemands for the National Guard to return to normal duties were answered in part this week when 150 members were reassigned to wildfire season preparation. Some 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines remain at federal buildings in Los Angeles while a lawsuit filed by the state against the Trump administration is pending in court.\n\nA three-judge appeals court panel has said that the White House likely lawfully exercised its authority when Trump federalized the National Guard without Gov. Gavin Newsoms consent. The ruling halted a lower courts decision, which found the Trump administration had illegally activated the troops.\n\nNewsom said last month that he will pursue legal action to regain control of the guard.\n\nLawmakers and legal organizations are waging their own court battles ahead of the holiday weekend. On Wednesday, immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block an ongoing pattern and practice of flouting the Constitution and federal law during immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\nSince June 6th, marauding, masked goons have descended upon Los Angeles, terrorizing our brown communities and tearing up the Constitution in the process, said Mohammad Tajsar, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Southern California.\n\nNo matter their status or the color of their skin,\" he added, \"everyone is guaranteed Constitutional rights to protect them from illegal stops. We will hold DHS accountable.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the claims are false.\n\nThis week, county supervisors approved a motion to pursue legal action against the Trump administration. The vote came after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles over its sanctuary city policies, which prevent local police agencies from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nThe U.S. government claims sanctuary city ordinances discriminate against federal law enforcement agencies by treating them differently from other policing authorities."

        "content": "Rescuers scoured flooded riverbanks littered with mangled trees Saturday and turned over rocks in the search for more than two dozen children from a girls camp and many others missing after a wall of water blasted down a river in the Texas Hill Country. The storm killed at least 27 people, including nine children.\n\nThe destructive fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as torrential rains continued pounding communities outside San Antonio on Saturday and flash flood warnings and watches remained in effect.\n\nSearchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue stranded people in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads.\n\nPeople need to know today will be a hard day, said Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring, Jr. Please pray for our community.\n\nAuthorities were coming under growing scrutiny Saturday over whether the camps and residents in places long vulnerable to flooding received proper warning and whether enough preparations were made.\n\nThe hills along the Guadalupe River in central Texas are dotted with century-old youth camps and campgrounds where generations of families have come to swim and enjoy the outdoors. The area is especially popular around the July Fourth holiday, making it more difficult to know how many are missing.\n\nWe dont even want to begin to estimate at this time, said City Manager Dalton Rice said on Saturday morning.\n\nRaging storm hit camp in middle of the night\n\nSome 27 children were among the missing from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river, he said.\n\nThe camp was completely destroyed, said Elinor Lester, one of hundreds of campers. A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.\n\nA raging storm woke up her cabin just after midnight Friday, and when rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with water whipping around their legs, she said.\n\nFrantic parents and families posted photos of missing loved ones and pleas for information.\n\nOn Saturday, the camp was mostly deserted. Helicopters roared above as a few people looked at the damage, including a pickup truck tossed onto its side and a building missing its entire front wall.\n\nAmong those confirmed dead was the director of a camp just up the road from Camp Mystic.\n\nThe flooding in the middle of the night caught many residents, campers and officials by surprise in the Hill Country, which sits northwest of San Antonio.\n\nAccuWeather said the private forecasting company and the National Weather Service sent warnings about potential flash flooding hours before the devastation.\n\nThese warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety, AccuWeather said in a statement that called the Hill Country one of the most flash-flood-prone areas of the U.S. because of its terrain and many water crossings.\n\nOfficials defended their actions while saying they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months worth of rain for the area.\n\nOne National Weather Service forecast earlier in the week did not predict the amount of rain that we saw, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management.\n\nHelicopters, drones used in frantic search for missing\n\nSearch crews were facing harsh conditions while looking in every possible location, Mr. Rice said.\n\nAuthorities said about 850 people had been rescued. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters were flying in to assist.\n\nOne reunification center at an elementary school was mostly quiet Saturday after taking in hundreds of evacuees the day before.\n\nWe still have people coming here looking for their loved ones. Weve had a little success, but not much, said Bobby Templeton, superintendent of Ingram Independent School District.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was traveling to Texas and his administration was working with officials on the ground.\n\nMelania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy, Mr. Trump said in a statement on his social media network.\n\nResidents clung to trees, fled to attics\n\nIn Ingram, Erin Burgess woke to thunder and rain in the middle of the night Friday. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home, she said. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree with her teenage son.\n\nMy son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them, she said.\n\nBarry Adelman said water pushed everyone in his three-story house into the attic, including his grandmother and grandson.\n\nI was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death, he said.\n\nLocal resident know it as flash flood alley. \n\nWhen it rains, water doesnt soak into the soil, said Austin Dickson, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, which was collecting donations. It rushes down the hill.\n\nNo one knew this kind of flood was coming\n\nThe forecast for the weekend had called for rain, with a flood watch upgraded to a warning overnight Friday for at least 30,000 people. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area.\n\nEverything was done to give them a heads up that you could have heavy rain, and were not exactly sure where its going to land, Mr. Patrick said. Obviously as it got dark last night, we got into the wee morning of the hours, thats when the storm started to zero in.\n\nKerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the countys chief elected official, said: We do not have a warning system.\n\nWhen pushed on why more precautions werent taken, Kelly said no one knew this kind of flood was coming.\n\nMore pockets of heavy rains expected\n\nThe slow-moving storm is bringing more rain Saturday, with the potential for pockets of heavy downpours and more flooding, said Jason Runyen, of the National Weather Service.\n\nThe threat could linger overnight and into Sunday morning, he said.\n\nThis story was reported by the Associated Press.

        "content": "CNN \n\nThe Fulton County District Attorneys office said some fake electors for Donald Trump have implicated each other in potential criminal activity and is seeking to disqualify their lawyer, according to a new court filing.\n\nThe district attorneys office is requesting that attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow be disqualified from representing a group of 10 Republicans who served as electors for the former president in Georgia  a state Trump lost to President Joe Biden. The DAs office also accused the lawyer of failing to present an immunity deal to her clients last year, according to the filing.\n\nThe new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were imminent.\n\nIt notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.\n\nThe statement of some of her clients that directly implicate another client in additional crimes shows that Ms. Debrows continued participation in this matter is fraught with conflicts of interest that rise to the level of her being disqualified from this case in its entirety, the district attorneys office wrote in the filing.\n\nDuring the April 2023 interviews, some of the electors stated that another elector represented by Ms. Debrow committed acts that are violations of Georgia law and that they were not party to these additional acts, according to the filing.\n\nAmid a fight last year to compel the fake electors to testify, the court instructed two attorneys, including Debrow, to inform their clients with potential immunity deals. The attorneys told the court that they spoke to their clients and none of the clients were interested, according to filing. Now the DAs office is claiming those offers were never presented to the clients.\n\nAdditionally, in these interviews, some of the electors represented by Ms. Debrow told members of the investigation team that no potential offer of immunity was ever brought to them in 2022, the filing states.\n\nDebrow slammed the latest motion in a statement.\n\nThe DAs Motion is baseless, false, and offensive, Debrow said. None of my clients have committed any crimes, and they necessarily have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes.\n\nNo one has been charged yet in the Georgia case, though several people  including the 16 fake electors and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani  were informed they were potential targets of Williss probe.\n\nA special grand jury investigating the matter concluded its work late last year and recommended more than a dozen people should face charges, the foreperson for the panel said in interviews.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

        "content": "Moiss Caicedo was still going strong. There were 108 minutes on the clock at the Bank of America Stadium  not taking into account the lengthy weather delay  when the Chelsea midfielder won possession in Benficas half, found Cole Palmer and surged forward.\n\nPalmer advanced towards a back-pedalling, understaffed defence. He waited for support before finding the overlapping Caicedo. Benfica, tiring with 10 men, were defeated by Caicedos power. The 23-year-old shot, Anatoliy Trubin made a mess of his save and the ball squirmed loose to Christopher Nkunku to score the goal that sent Enzo Marescas side into the quarter-finals of the Club World Cup.\n\nOne problem, though: Caicedo will be serving a one-game ban when Chelsea meet Palmeiras in Philadelphia on Friday night. One momentary lapse of judgment could prove costly. Caicedo had to be smarter when he questioned a refereeing decision in the second half against Benfica. He took his protest too far and received a booking for dissent, leaving Maresca with a dilemma.\n\nCaicedo is Chelseas midfield linchpin  nobody mocks his 115m fee now  and his absence is significant. The Ecuadorian started every Premier League game last season, becoming the first Chelsea player to do so since Csar Azpilicueta in the 2018-19 campaign, and his durability is not in doubt.\n\nStretch it out and he has not been forced to miss a game since illness kept him out of a 2-1 defeat to Wolves on Christmas Eve in 2023. Before that, the only other times when he has not started in the league were as a late substitute during a 4-1 defeat to Newcastle in November 2023 after returning late from international duty and when unavailable for a goalless draw against Bournemouth in September 2023.\n\nIt has become common to see Caicedo run off an injury after coming off worse in a 50-50 challenge. He needed treatment on a blow to his knee against Benfica but still played on. No wonder Maresca has leant so heavily on him. The head coach does not like to go into key games without the former Brighton midfielder.\n\nThere was no question of Maresca resting Caicedo in the league when he was one yellow card away from a two-match ban during last seasons run-in. Caicedo was trusted to stay out of trouble, even though he plays on the edge and is never shy to go in hard when the ball is there to be won.\n\nBut indiscipline has cost him in the United States. Chelsea, who have added Joo Pedro to their squad after signing the forward from Brighton, have to react. Caicedo plays when it matters. Maresca rested him in the Carabao Cup and in easy Conference League games but never when the stakes were high. After all, Caicedo started and scored in the Conference League final victory over Real Betis. Being given a breather against Esprance last week is irrelevant given that Caicedo has started three of four games at the Club World Cup.\n\nCaicedos importance is vast. His long-term cover is Drio Essugo, who has just joined from Sporting. Essugo is inexperienced and has only made two substitute appearances for his new side. It would be a huge gamble for Maresca to select the combative 20-year-old against Palmeiras.\n\nView image in fullscreen Drio Essugo (left) has made only two substitute appearances for Chelsea so it would be gamble to field the combative 20-year-old against Palmeiras. Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA\n\nMaresca is likely to find other ways to compensate for losing his best tackler. It is frustrating given that the Benfica game was the first time Caicedo, Romo Lavia and Enzo Fernndez had started together in midfield since the opening weekend of last season. The likeliest solution seems to be shifting Fernndez into a deeper role.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no replacement for Lavias control and ability to conduct play. Chelsea need him to be ready for his fourth start of the tournament. Essugo is raw. Andrey Santos is viewed as a No 8 and is learning Marescas style. Reece James impressed at right-back against Benfica but struggled in central midfield when Chelsea lost to Flamengo in Philadelphia during the group stage.\n\nThat was a bad afternoon. Nicolas Jackson was sent off  the striker has completed a two-game ban  and Chelsea failed to cope with Flamengos flair, adventure and passion. At least they face Palmeiras knowing not to underestimate Brazilian opposition.\n\nPalmeiras remain unbeaten and will be backed by a large following at Lincoln Financial Field. They have tried to calm the hype around Estvo, the exciting young winger who joins Chelsea after the tournament. Their manager, Abel Ferreira, has won 10 trophies during his five years in the job, developed young talent and turned down lucrative offers from clubs in Europe and Saudi Arabia because of his desire to make Palmeiras world champions for the first time.\n\nChelsea will have to be at their best. There has been talk of a favourable route to the final  they avoided a last-16 tie against Bayern Munich and were expected to face Manchester City in the last four, only for Al-Hilal to shock Pep Guardiolas side  but there is no room for complacency against Palmeiras. It is a repeat of the 2022 final, when Thomas Tuchels Chelsea collected the final trophy of the Roman Abramovich era by beating Ferreiras punchy Palmeiras side in extra time, and it will not be easy without Caicedo."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "As heavy rain triggered flash flood warnings along the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country early Friday, the small unincorporated town of Comfort had something its neighbors upriver in Kerr County didnt: wailing sirens urging residents to flee before the water could swallow them.\n\nComfort had recently updated its disaster alert system, installing a new siren in the volunteer fire departments headquarters and moving the old one to a low-lying area of town along Cypress Creek, a tributary of the Guadalupe that is prone to flooding. Friday was the first time the new two-siren system had been used outside of tests, providing a last-minute alarm for anyone who hadnt responded to previous warnings on their cellphones or evacuation announcements from firefighters driving around town.\n\nPeople knew that if they heard the siren, they gotta get out, said Danny Morales, assistant chief of the Comfort Volunteer Fire Department.\n\nLast year, Comfort installed a new weather alert siren outside the fire department headquarters. Table Rock Alerting Systems\n\nMorales said that no one died in Comfort, a town of about 2,300 people in Kendall County. But in Kerr County about 20 miles away, dozens of people, including young girls staying at Camp Mystic, a riverside Christian summer camp, were washed away when the Guadalupe surged over its banks and swamped the surrounding countryside. As of Monday evening, officials said, 104 people had been confirmed dead, 84 of them in Kerr County, including dozens of children. Kerr County has no siren system despite years of debate, in part because some local officials felt it was too expensive to install.\n\nThe part of Texas Hill Country known as flash flood alley has seen rising waters many times before, but the swift and punishing destruction over the Fourth of July has focused attention on whether local officials are doing enough to protect their residents as climate change causes more frequent and severe weather disasters and the federal government is slashing spending on emergency preparedness.\n\nThe swollen river has receded, leaving behind heartbreaking signs of the devastation: little girls suitcases and clothes strewn along the wrecked cabin grounds and plush toys caked with detritus, twisted metal and gnarled vehicles. Three days after the flooding, searchers were still picking through downed trees and hunting through thick black mud for those still missing. Parents hopes were dimming as the days dragged on with no signs of life.\n\nLast week's devastation has raised calls for improved weather alert systems across Texas Hill Country. Ronaldo Schemidt / AFP - Getty Images\n\nIt is impossible to know whether a siren system in Kerr County would have saved lives; they are meant to alert people who are outdoors, not in bed indoors, as many of Kerr Countys victims were when the river rose overnight  at one point by 26 feet in just 45 minutes.\n\nThe weather service issued a flood watch for the area Thursday afternoon and an urgent flash flood warning for Kerr County at 1:14 a.m. Friday, a move that triggers the wireless emergency alerts on cellphones.\n\nBy the time flooding inundated low-lying parts of Kendall County, where Comfort is located, it was later Friday morning. The first weather service flash flood alert for Kendall came at 7:24 a.m. When the sirens went off, many residents were already awake and aware of the dangerous flooding. A Facebook video recorded by Jeff Flinn, the managing editor of The Boerne Star, shows the emergency sirens in Comfort sounding at 10:52 a.m.; he said the alert lasted for about 30 seconds.\n\nKerr County was relying on the emergency alerts that blare on cellphones. Those alerts may not get through, particularly in rural areas with bad service or in the night when phones are off or when there are no phones around; the girls at the summer camp werent allowed to bring them. And some may choose to ignore them, because theyre bombarded by phone alerts.\n\nSome Texas officials have blamed the National Weather Service, arguing it didnt do a good enough job forecasting rainfall and issuing timely flood warnings. But some independent meteorologists and a former weather service official told NBC News that the agency performed as well as it could given the unpredictability of rain and flash flooding and the timing of the disaster.\n\nThe computerized siren system in Comfort, Texas, receives data directly from the National Weather Service. Table Rock Alerting Systems\n\nTom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, said he began looking into a warning system for his area after flooding in Hays County, which was overwhelmed by the Blanco River, killed 13 people over Memorial Day weekend in 2015.\n\nKerr County officials debated various options, including one for an alert system that included sensors and sirens, and the cost was about $1 million, Moser said.\n\nThere were a number of people that did not like the sirens going off because they go off accidentally, Moser said. They didnt want that disturbance in the Hill Country.\n\nAt a March 2016 commissioners meeting, Rusty Hierholzer, then the Kerr County sheriff, was adamant that the deadly flooding in the Hays County community of Wimberley was a warning for the need to install sirens in addition to a phone app notification system known as Code Red already in use.\n\nIn Wimberley, some people didnt get alerts on their phones, so yes, you need both, Hierholzer said, according to a transcript of the meeting. You need the sirens, and you need Code Red to try and make sure well notify everybody as we can when its coming up.\n\nDuring a follow-up discussion about the proposal that August, then-Commissioner H.A. Buster Baldwin questioned the flood warning system they were considering, saying, I think this whole thing is a little extravagant for Kerr County, with sirens and such, according to a transcript.\n\nThey estimated the system would cost $1 million, and they didn't have the money to add it to the budget.\n\nMoser said they also didnt get disaster relief funding theyd asked for from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As a matter of fact, there were no grants available we thought we could get in a timely fashion, Moser said."

        "content": "The EU is entering a crunch week with only two days of talks left to secure a trade deal with Washinton to avert Donald Trumps threatened 50% tariff on its imports into the US.\n\nAccording to the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, on Friday, the negotiations  which continued over the weekend  are focussed on 15 to 18 agreements with important partners, while Trump warned of import tax rates of up to 70% on others.\n\nThe uncertainty created by Washington has sent shock waves through the global economy. Businesses have paused investment and the dollar posted its worst performance in 50 years in the first half of the year.\n\nWith the clock ticking down to Trumps 9 July deadline, the European Commission remains uncertain how he will treat the bloc, threatening 1.6tn of transatlantic trade.\n\nAmong member states, the big question will be whether we should reach a deal at all costs to avoid a trade war, or show muscle if the deal is not good enough, one EU diplomat said.\n\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has said he wants a quick UK-style deal to avert a full-scale trade war, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, favours holding out for a better deal if a rushed deal is imbalanced.\n\nGiving a flavour of the aggression shown towards the EU, which Trump once called nastier than China, Brussels trade commissioner, Maro efovi, was threatened last week with 17% tariffs on food imports during talks with senior members of the Trump administration including Bessent.\n\nAfter announcing punitive liberation day tariffs on nearly all countries on 2 April, Trump paused them for 90 days a week later.\n\nThe US is now on the brink of launching a trade assault on dozens of countries as the 90-day period expires on Wednesday with only two deals in the bag  the UK and Vietnam.\n\nThis has raised questions about the EUs ability to strike anything other than a political framework agreement to extend talks while a baseline 10% tariff and other levies on cars, steel and aluminium remain in place.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day  we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They expect the cost of Trumps presidency will be the minimum 10% on exports to the US, five times higher than the 2% average before he was elected last year.\n\nThat is because after months of threats of retaliatory tariffs on everything from Bourbon to Boeing aircraft, the EU conceded last week that a comprehensive trade deal was unattainable.\n\nInstead they are aiming for an agreement in principle, or framework deal which will look more like the UK deal struck in May, which came into force at the end of last month.\n\nMany EU diplomats initially dismissed the UK deal as thin and legally dubious under World Trade Organization rules, and held out hope that the blocs greater economic clout with 1.6tn of transatlantic trade compared with the UKs 314bn (363bn) would help it secure a better deal. But now they realise a bare-bones deal may be the best they can get."

        "content": "New York CNN \n\nMcDonalds, which has been focusing on upgrading its core items to boost sales, is rolling out a series of changes designed to improve its signature burgers.\n\nBuns will be softer. Cheese, gooier. Onion will be added to patties right on the grill. And the Big Mac sauce? There will be more of it.\n\nWe found that small changes, like tweaking our process to get hotter, meltier cheese and adjusting our grill settings for a better sear, added up to a big difference in making our burgers more flavorful than ever, said chef Chad Schafer, senior director of culinary innovation of McDonalds USA, in a statement Monday. The upgrades apply to the Big Mac and the McDouble burger as well as the classic cheeseburger, double cheeseburger and hamburger.\n\nThe Big Mac will come with more Big Mac sauce. McDonald's USA\n\nThe improvements were first made to burgers in international markets, the company said, and have already arrived in some US cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas. Theyll be available nationally by early next year.\n\nThe changes follow other improvements to key menu items.\n\nIn 2018, McDonalds announced that it was switching to fresh beef for its Quarter Pounders, a complicated move with a big sales payoff. In 2021, it launched a crispy chicken sandwich to replace previous iterations  a relatively late arrival in the chicken sandwich wars, but one that seems to have resonated with McDonalds customers. .\n\nWe are gaining market share in both chicken and beef, thanks to improved burgers and items like the chicken sandwich, said McDonalds (MCD) CEO Chris Kempczinski during a January analyst call. In an environment where our customers are looking for the simple and familiar, our core menu items have never been more relevant, he said. In the US, sales at stores open at least 13 months jumped 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022, rising 10.3% for the whole year.\n\nEven the humble cheeseburger is getting an upgrade. McDonald's USA\n\nFocusing on promoting its core menu items, rather than introducing new products, is a way to keep processes simpler and reduce friction in the kitchen. And McDonalds has been using promotions like celebrity meal platforms and the adult Happy Meal to create buzz around its signature items.\n\nThroughout 2022, some of our most successful campaign platforms brought our customers closer to the core menu items, Kempczinski said during the January call.\n\nMcDonalds isnt the only brand trying to improve its main offerings.\n\nBurger King, which last year announced a plan to turn its business around, has been focusing on improving the Whopper and making it more visible in advertising. In the fourth quarter last year, it held Whopper trainings for franchisees. The brand said in February that the Whopper contributed to higher US sales in that quarter."

        "content": "Nearly 10 years after he changed the lives of every queer person in America, Jim Obergefell sat in a crowded bar on a small island in Lake Erie, watching the close-knit local community celebrate its third annual Pride.\n\nJim, 58, made history as the lead plaintiff in the landmark legal case Obergefell vs. Hodges, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 26, 2015, that same-sex couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry.\n\nThe last decade has diminished the familiarity of his face, once everywhere on cable news, and he appeared to sit anonymously now, sipping a beer in a booth. But Jims legacy still resonates deeply with LGBTQ+ people all over the country, in both red and blue states and in little purplish outposts like Put-in-Bay, too  as Molly Kearney, the queer comedian on stage, would soon make clear.\n\nKearney spent years working at island bars and restaurants before making it big and landing a gig as the first nonbinary cast member of Saturday Night Live. They are something of a legend on the island about three miles off the Ohio coast, and the crowd was loving their set  which was chock full of stories about getting drunk at local watering holes and navigating life and family as a young queer person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen Kearney brought up Jims case.\n\nThe day the Supreme Court issued its decision, Kearney was working at a restaurant called The Forge alongside co-owner Marc Wright, who is gay and one of the organizers of Put-in-Bay Pride. Wright immediately told the LGBTQ+ staff their work day was done.\n\nI just remember that day so vividly, Kearney said. Hes like, All right, all the straight people have to work.

It was a magnificent day.\n\nJim, caught off guard, was also clearly tickled as he quietly took in the many smiling faces around him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of people have told him over the last decade how much his case transformed their lives. Many have cried upon meeting him. Some have said his victory gave them the courage to come out to their families and friends, and even to themselves. One told him she was preparing to take her own life until his win.\n\nStill, Kearneys story might be his new favorite, he said.\n\nFor starters, it was darn funny, he said. But it also was rooted in queer acceptance in a small community not unlike the coastal town a short ferry ride away, Sandusky, Ohio, where Jim grew up  and now lives again.\n\nIt captured something Jim has observed in his own life the last few years in Ohio, something that might be his greatest legacy, especially in light of recent political efforts to push LGBTQ+ rights backward and queer people back into the closet.\n\nKearneys story captured people in an average, not especially progressive American community not just accepting their queer neighbors and friends  but celebrating their right to love.\n\nSigns mark the city limits and some of the notable residents of Sandusky. Murals and paintings seen in downtown on a Sunday in June.\n\nAt home in Sandusky\n\nThe night before the comedy show, Jim was in Sandusky, hosting a dinner party in his well-appointed and art-adorned apartment with about a dozen of his closest friends, family and neighbors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe served some of his own wine  hes a co-founder of Equality Vines out of Guerneville  and ordered a bunch of pizza, including a Sandusky special: sausage and sauerkraut.\n\nThere was his older brother and sister-in-law, Chuck and Janice Obergefell, who recalled traveling to D.C. for the Supreme Court arguments. Their kids are also close to Jim.\n\nThe minute we heard you were going to Washington, we just thought, Wow, this is too cool, Janice told Jim. Were awfully darn proud of you, but you know that.\n\nChuck had worked his whole life in local plants, and had known a few gay men there  regular blue-collar guys who also happened to be the friendliest people Ive ever met, he said. So when Jim came out to him in the early 1990s, it didnt bother him much, though he did worry about HIV/AIDS.\n\nI just told him, Youre my brother, I love ya, just be careful, Chuck said.\n\nThen he brought John around, said Janice, of Jims late husband John Arthur.\n\nAnd I liked John more than Jim! Chuck said with a wry smile.\n\nThere were several of Jims oldest and dearest friends, including Kay Hollek, a friend since they were 4; Judi Nath, a friend since 7th grade; Jennifer Arthur, his 1984 prom date; and Betsy Kay, a friend from high school chorus.\n\nThere were also newer friends from town, including Marsha Gray Carrington, a photographer and painter whose work adorns Jims walls, and from Jims gayborhood, as he called it  including neighbors Dick Ries and Jim Ervin, a married couple who briefly employed Jim as a Sandusky segway tour guide, and Debbie Braun, a retired Los Angeles teacher who, like Jim, decided to move back to her hometown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation ranged freely from Jims personal legacy to local politics in Sandusky, which is moderate compared to the red rural towns and bigger blue cities nearby. The talk jumped to national politics and recent attacks on the LGBTQ+ community, which have made some of them worry for Jims safety as an icon of a movement, as his former prom date put it.\n\nAn oil painting hangs on the wall of Jim Obergefells home in June.\n\nRies and Ervin, who started dating about 17 years ago, drew laughs with a story about learning of the Supreme Court decision. Ervin was bawling  tears of joy  when he called Ries, who was driving and immediately thought something horrible had happened.\n\nI think the house has burned down, hes wrecked the car, the dog is dead, Ries said with a chuckle. It wasnt until he pulled over that he understood the happy news.\n\nThe couple had held off having a marriage ceremony because they wanted it to be real, including in the eyes of their home state, Ervin said. After the ruling, they quickly made plans, and married less than 8 months later on Feb. 6, 2016.\n\nTo me, it was profound that once and for all, we could all get married, Ervin said.\n\nJim Obergefell, left, and John Arthur, right, are married by officiant Paulette Roberts, rear center, in a plane on the tarmac at Baltimore/Washington International Airport in Glen Burnie, Md., in 2013. (Glenn Hartong / The Cincinnati Enquirer via Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group talked about what kept them in or brought them to Sandusky: family, the low cost of living, small-town friendliness. They talked about the other queer people in their lives, including some of their children. They mentioned how the only gay bar in town recently closed.\n\nIn between the heavier discussions, they chatted in the warm, cheeky patterns of old friends catching up over pizza and wine. At one point, Jim and several of his girlfriends gathered in the kitchen to discuss  what else?  Jims dating life.\n\nJust the week before, Jim said, he had realized he was ready to let go of Johns ashes, to spread them somewhere special as John had requested, and finally ready to date again.\n\nIm open, he said, as his girlfriends eyes lit up.\n\nThe case that landed Jim before the Supreme Court started during one of the hardest periods of his life, when John was dying from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrigs disease. The couple had been together for decades, and in July 2013, three months before Johns death, exchanged vows in Maryland, one of the states that recognized same-sex marriages at the time.\n\nHowever, Ohio refused to acknowledge that marriage, meaning that, when John died, Jim would not be listed as the surviving spouse on his state death certificate. So they sued.\n\nFor years after Johns death and the subsequent court rulings in their favor, Jim kept busy co-writing a book, traveling the country giving speeches and attending Pride events and LGBTQ+ fundraisers as a guest of honor. He was mourning John, too, of course, but amid so many other draws on his focus and attention, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts almost like you didnt get to do it right away, said Betsy. You had it delayed.\n\nAfter living in Cincinnati from 1984 to 2016  most of that time with John  Jim moved to D.C. for a few years, but missed Ohio, he said.\n\nIn 2021, as the COVID pandemic raged, he found himself increasingly lonely, he said, so he decided to move back to Sandusky to be closer to family and friends. Since then, he has been happier, rekindling old connections, making some new ones and even running  unsuccessfully  for office.\n\nBetsy, a mother of nine  some queer  and a ball of energy, said its wonderful to have Jim back in town. The one catch, she acknowledged, is the gay dating pool in Sandusky, population about 24,000, is not exactly deep.\n\nTo make matters worse, Jim is hopelessly oblivious when it comes to flirting, she said. The other women in the kitchen nodded.\n\nTaking the cue, Jim went to his bedroom and returned with a small pin Betsy had given him, which read, If youre flirting with me, please let me know. And be extremely specific. Seriously, Im clueless.\n\nJim looked around his apartment, in his hometown, brimming with fiercely loyal friends and family who not only love him, but want him to find love.\n\nThanks in part to him, it was a scene that lucky, happy queer people might find familiar nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Greetings from Sandusky, Ohio sign. The Ceiling Art Company and a row of buildings on West Market Street downtown.\n\nJim Obergefell holds a button with a message that reads in part, if youre flirting with me please let me know..\n\nBack on the island\n\nShortly after Kearneys set at Put-in-Bay Pride, Kristin Vogel-Campbell, a 45-year-old bisexual educator from nearby Port Clinton, approached Jim at his booth.\n\nHer friend had just pointed Jim out  told her who he was  and she just had to thank him.\n\nYouve done so much for our community, she said. You put yourself out there, and did the work that was needed to get the job done.\n\nJim, not anonymous after all, smiled and thanked her.\n\nA few moments later, Kearney came through the crowd, high-fiving and hugging old friends. When they, too, were told who Jim was, their jaw dropped.\n\nAre you serious? ... Hold on.\n\nMarc Wright, left, and Molly Kearney snap a picture together at Put-in-Bay Pride on June 9. (Courtesy of Marc Wright)\n\nKearney ran over and grabbed Wright out of another conversation and explained who Jim was. Wrights eyes went wide  then he reached out and touched Jim on the chest, as if to verify he was real.\n\nKearney, sticking their arms out to show goosebumps, said, I have the chillies.\n\nKearney doesnt often include the story of the Supreme Court ruling in their sets, they said, but thought the local crowd would get a kick out of it, because they knew that day had meant a lot to so many people.\n\nThat day  thanks to you  was a very big day for me, Kearney told Jim. I didnt feel fully comfortable  I still dont  so that day was really important, because everyone was, like, cheering!\n\nWright nodded along.\n\nHe first came to Put-in-Bay from Cleveland when he was 21  or a baby gay, as he put it. And initially, it was intimidating. Its easy to feel like an outcast in a small community, because youre living in a fish bowl, he said.\n\nSoon enough, however, the town made him one of their own. People on the island knew I was gay before I knew, and everyone was like, Yeah, its OK, Wright said.\n\nHe said such acceptance, which has only grown on the island since, is thanks to pioneers like Jim  and like Kearney, whose own success has increased understanding of nonbinary people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust to have Molly go out and live their life so unapologetically, its so validating, Wright said.\n\nIntroducing Kearney that afternoon, Wright had thanked the crowd  many of them locals  for proving that Put-in-Bay stands for love and equality, especially at such a difficult time for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nPut-in-Bay is for everyone  one island, one family, he said.\n\nNow, as Jim praised the event, saying it was just the sort of thing thats needed in small towns all across the country, Wright beamed."

        "content": "Ghost guns may make a comeback, despite a Supreme Court ruling\n\ntoggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe legal battle over \"ghost guns\" is far from over, even after the Supreme Court upheld a Biden-era regulation requiring background checks and serial numbers for certain build-it-yourself firearm kits.\n\nThese kits, which allow buyers to assemble functioning guns from parts, have drawn scrutiny from law enforcement. Because the kits were initially sold without serial numbers or background checks, authorities often couldn't trace the weapons  earning them the moniker \"ghost guns.\"\n\n\"The people who make them, oftentimes, and put them on the street are putting them in the hands of people who are prohibited, putting them in the hands of convicted felons,\" said Bill Brooks, who chairs the firearms committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. \"As evidenced by the fact that so many of them now are showing up at crime scenes .\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Biden administration moved to close that loophole in 2022 with a rule requiring that certain gun kits be treated like complete firearms  and sold with serial numbers and background checks. That rule was challenged in a federal case known as Bondi v. VanDerStok , but in March the Supreme Court allowed it to stand.\n\n\"It was good that the court upheld the ATF regulation,\" Brooks said.\n\nStill, gun rights groups see an opening. The high court's decision turned primarily on questions of administrative law, and left open the possibility of future challenges, depending on kit designs.\n\nIn addition, the Trump administration has ordered the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to review all Biden-era gun regulations, including the ghost gun rule. The executive orde r, signed in February, calls for the review of regulations \"that purport to promote safety but may have impinged on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\"\n\n\"We've urged the administration to act as quickly as possible,\" said Alan Gottlieb, executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation. \"However, there's a lot on their plate, and I don't know how quickly it will happen. But we'd like it as soon as possible.\"\n\nNot all gun rights activists are willing to wait. Cody Wilson, known for his advocacy of 3D-printed guns, now markets a product called the G80 through his company, Defense Distributed. Though careful not to label it a gun, Wilson describes it as a kit that \"you can ultimately build into a 9mm pistol, let's say.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWilson worries the Trump administration will side with law enforcement and maintain restrictions on kit guns. So he's filed a motion in the VanDerStok case, which has been remanded back to federal court in Texas, asking for a preliminary injunction to stop the government from enforcing the ATF's ghost gun rule.\n\nWilson says he sees an obligation to press the question on constitutional grounds.\n\n\"I actually want there to be some law before this administration is over,\" he said, \"that the Second Amendment includes the right to build arms and not just keep them.\"\n\nGun control advocates say this is part of an extreme strategy to dismantle firearm regulations entirely.\n\n\"There are folks out there who want there to be no gun laws at all, and they see this as being the avenue to do it,\" said David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\n\"If they can sell a gun in parts without it counting as a gun, there are no gun laws that apply at all,\" he said. \"That's the end goal here.\"\n\nFor now, both sides are watching closely to see how vigorously the Trump Justice Department defends the Biden-era rule. The DOJ has opposed Wilson's preliminary injunction, but it recently filed with the federal court a copy of a letter it sent to Defense Distributed's lawyer in May, saying it would not enforce the rule against a list of the company's products, and adding that it would \"provide an expedited informal classification\" for the \"G80\" kit.\n\nPucino, at Giffords Law, calls the letter \"really troubling\" -- a sign the Trump administration may become more lenient toward the kits, and less likely to classify them as regulated firearms."

        "content": "After rifling through a kitchen cabinet to find a hole punch, William Bradley sat down at his dining room table Friday morning in Minneapolis with a cup of coffee and the diplomatic passport that hes had for roughly two decades. As instructed, he punched two holes on the bottom. He took a picture of those holes with his cellphone. Then, he emailed the government proof that his career was over.\n\nIt was at this table five months ago that Mr. Bradley learned from a cable TV news report that he and most of his 10,000 colleagues at the United States Agency for International Development were losing their jobs. For the past five months hes felt scared. He was three years away from retirement and the pension his family has been counting on. For five months hes felt guilty. When the news broke, Mr. Bradley had just finished onboarding 21 new USAID employees who had quit other jobs to serve America. For five months hes been angry. One day, he walked out his front door and got in his VW camper van, closed the door, and screamed.\n\nAnd, against his better judgment, for five months hes been in denial  waiting until the day the photo proof was actually due to pull out his hole punch. A small part of him had hoped that his government would realize, at some point, that it needed him.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Five months after the Trump administration announced it was gutting USAID, most workers got their final paychecks this week. Many have been struggling to find a sense of purpose as well as financial stability. The Monitor followed one veteran worker as he tried to figure out his next steps.\n\nBut July 1 is the official restructuring deadline, putting some USAID functions under the purview of the State Department while terminating the rest. It is also the last day on the payroll for USAID employees like Mr. Bradley.\n\nNow, after a liminal period of judicial restraining orders, reversals, and much waiting, thousands of USAID workers are having to begin a new chapter. For many  along with other federal workers fired at the hands of President Donald Trumps Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE  that means figuring out a new career in a flooded job market. Some are considering running for political office. Others are suing the government they used to serve.\n\nOverall, at least 58,000 federal workers have been fired since President Trump took office in January, promising to dismantle Government Bureaucracy and hold a crooked and dishonest workforce to account. Another 76,000 have accepted buyouts.\n\nFew agencies, however, have received the kind of vitriol leveled at USAID. Mr. Trump has called USAID employees radical left lunatics who have stolen BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Elon Musk, the worlds richest man, who headed DOGEs efforts for months, celebrated feeding USAID into the wood chipper while helping to cut more than 99% of the agencys staff.\n\nOne challenge for many of these former employees is reconciling how they see themselves  as loyal Americans who have dedicated their lives to their nation  with the derogatory statements from their president and his administration.\n\nMr. Bradley has always considered himself a patriot, someone who serves his country.\n\nNow he looks to his family, sitting around the dining room table, with a pressing question: Should I run for Congress?\n\nNo, says Hawa, his daughter, who just graduated from middle school.\n\nI think its wiser to take a job, says his son, James, who will begin a Ph.D. program in chemistry at the University of Minnesota this fall but is worried about the apartment lease he just signed, given the Trump administrations cuts to science funding.\n\nWhy do you want to batter yourself again? asks his wife, Azarath. Your government should protect you, not hurt you.\n\nStory Hinckley/The Christian Science Monitor Azarath Bradley cooks a traditional Beninese meal in her kitchen in Minneapolis, June 20, 2025. She's been debating whether she should drop out of culinary school and try to find work, since her husband lost his job.\n\nA life of foreign service assignments\n\nOver the 17 years he spent as an officer in the United States Agency for International Development, Mr. Bradleys life was a series of assignments: Build latrines in Benin. Help farmers amid wars wreckage in Afghanistan. Oversee agriculture projects in Cambodia, Guinea, and Senegal.\n\nHe sometimes worried that he was putting his family through too much for the sake of his job. He remembers watching his children get their temperature checked before school every morning when they were in Guinea during the Ebola crisis. He recalls how his wife was so upset to leave Minneapolis for Senegal a decade ago that when the movers arrived, nothing was packed. James was unhappy in Guinea after leaving all of his friends in Cambodia and chose to finish junior high at a boarding school in Minneapolis. Hawa cant decide what country is home, after living in Minneapolis for three years and Senegal for five years before that.\n\nMr. Bradley always knew that private sector jobs in the mining industry, where he had started his career in Utah, paid double what he made with USAID. But whenever he considered quitting government service, he thought about how he made a difference in peoples lives as a representative of the United States. And he knew that even though he was making a lower salary now, he would have a federal pension later.\n\nWhen he turned on his work computer Friday so it could be remotely wiped by one of the few remaining USAID employees, he found himself reviewing some old documents, like one he had saved about the Foreign Service Pension System.\n\nIt confirmed the numbers he had already triple-checked on an Excel spreadsheet hed made. In three years, on July 3, 2028, Mr. Bradley would have had 20 years of qualifying service and been eligible for $4,274.82 a month before taxes and insurance.\n\nWe had a plan, Mr. Bradley says to Azarath, as well as himself. She hacks a raw chicken in the kitchen and packs cornmeal into balls for amiwo, a dish from her native Benin.\n\nIt was in Benin, when Mr. Bradley was serving in the Peace Corps, that he met Azarath. He would spend hours traveling to see her on the weekends. A few years later, Mr. Bradleys first paycheck from USAID went to a Beninese hospital to pay for the birth of their first child, James. When Mr. Bradley was assigned to a new project in Afghanistan and his young family couldnt come, he bought a house for them sight unseen in Minneapolis, where Azaraths new mother-in-law taught her how to ride the bus to her English classes, with James slung on her back.\n\nShe sighs. Adjusting to America alone with her baby, with her husband living abroad, was hard. But these past few months have been harder. When James graduated from college this spring, she wondered if it was OK to buy balloons since his dad had just lost his job. She wonders now if she should quit culinary school and find work herself, even though her goals (medium term, begin selling signature West African dishes locally; long term, own a restaurant in Minneapolis) remain tacked on the kitchen wall.\n\nThey had thought when Mr. Bradley retired he could help his wife open a restaurant, and she could finally launch her own career after so many years of supporting his. But now, Hawa was asking her mom if they would have to move again. Mrs. Bradley didnt know how to answer.\n\nWhat comes next when USAID closes\n\nThe rumors and news reports became real for Mr. Bradley on Feb. 4, when an email with the subject line The Path Forward arrived in his inbox, saying all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, except for a few mission-critical employees. Later that week, Mr. Bradley watched on television as a man in a cherry picker pried the letters spelling U.S. Agency for International Development off the Ronald Reagan building in Washington. He remembers being surprised at how easily they came off.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy created the agency during the Cold War in 1961 to compete with Soviet influence abroad. In the decades since, USAID grew into one of the largest aid organizations in the world, managing $77 billion in fiscal year 2024. Still, at the time of its gutting, it accounted for less than 1% of the U.S. governments budget, and a smaller share of gross domestic product than what other leading industrialized nations spend on foreign aid.\n\nIn those first weeks of February, as the agency was dismantled, protesters in Washington showed up to support what many saw as the pillar of American soft power. But the public outcry soon dwindled, even as the courts issued restraining orders and in some cases reversals. In late March, Mr. Bradley received a reduction in force (RIF) email telling him his pay would stop on July 1.\n\nMr. Bradley, along with more than 50 USAID colleagues, has filed a lawsuit alleging they were illegally terminated for political reasons. He has also joined more than 200 former USAID workers planning to file claims of age discrimination, because the RIF will affect their retirement benefits.\n\nYet even as he fights the government and feels deeply that it has broken its promises to him, Mr. Bradley also keeps thinking about other ways to serve. In particular, he wonders if running for office could allow him to keep his promise to protect the Constitution against any enemies  foreign or domestic.\n\nMy hearts really telling me to run, Mr. Bradley tells his family. Somebody has to hold them to account.\n\nSo, on a Saturday morning in late June, as an excessive heat warning blanketed Minneapolis, he found himself driving north on Interstate 94, hugging the Mississippi River in his yellow 1996 Ford F250.\n\nStory Hinckley/The Christian Science Monitor Democratic organizer Tamara Polzin gets ready for an informal candidate forum in Blaine, Minnesota, June 21. She says more than 13 people have already expressed serious interest in running in the 6th Congressional District, taking on incumbent GOP Rep. Tom Emmer.\n\nHe had spent the past few weeks tackling projects around the house, like replacing the brakes in his truck. He also did some things he never expected  like reaching out to a local contact for the Democratic Party. When he spoke to Tamara Polzin about his interest in possibly running for office, she invited Mr. Bradley to come to a forum in Blaine for potential congressional candidates.\n\nHe turns up the trucks radio dial, as a public policy expert on NPR explains the importance of keeping federal workers based on their experience, not loyalty. Mr. Bradley turns the radio back down. After 17 years he had experience, but hadnt he also been loyal?\n\nNew administrations always bring new priorities and new marching orders, and he believed his job was to follow them like a soldier. A few years after President George W. Bush announced the military invasion of Afghanistan, Mr. Bradley was dispatched to the Badakhshan Province to manage a $57 million contract helping locals find alternative crops to opium. At the end of President Barack Obamas second term, he was sent to West Africa to help farmers in Guinea and Sierra Leone recover from the Ebola outbreak.\n\nAlthough he was disappointed when the first Trump administration cut that projects funding, he accepted it as part of the job. He had hoped that Mr. Trump in his second term would see ways to use the organization for his own objectives, like jump-starting job opportunities abroad so fewer foreigners would try to immigrate to America illegally.\n\nBut even if Mr. Trump couldnt see value in USAID, Mr. Bradley believes other politicians  like Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP majority whip whose deep red district covers the northern and western outskirts of Minneapolis  should have.\n\nAre you running or watching?\n\nWalking into the Teamsters Union Hall, he finds Ms. Polzin taping participants name tags on the stage. As a local Democratic chair, Ms. Polzin has struggled in past cycles to find a single Democrat willing to run in the 6th district, one of the most Republican in the state. But now, more than a year and a half out from the 2026 midterms, she already has 13 interested candidates, including Mr. Bradley and five others taking the stage today to practice speaking in front of a friendly audience.\n\nThe excitement in the district is more than Ive ever seen, says Ms. Polzin. People have been protesting every week, she says, angry about deportations and cuts to Veterans Affairs, despite Mr. Emmers claims that the local VA has only dismissed seven probationary employees. A new energy was injected into those protests, she adds, after the recent shootings of two Democratic state lawmakers.\n\nMr. Bradley takes a seat in the second row, as other observers fill in behind him.\n\nAre you running or watching? a man behind him asks.\n\nJust watching, Mr. Bradley answers.\n\nThe event begins with a moment of silence for state Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was killed along with her husband on June 14 in their home just eight miles away. Were going to forge ahead and were going to show that they cant deter us and that the best way to honor the memory of Melissa and Mark is to have the seeds of democracy sprouting up all throughout the 6th Congressional District, says state Rep. Matt Norris, the events moderator.\n\nMr. Norris asks the five potential Democratic candidates questions about infrastructure, unions, science research, and Social Security. Throughout, Mr. Bradley takes notes on 3-by-5 index cards. He stays silent for the 90-minute event until the end, when one candidate, a flight attendant, talks about feeling an ethical compulsion to run for office.\n\nThats right, he says quietly. Thats right.\n\nBy Monday morning, though, that compulsion to run feels more like an impractical whim. For his familys sake, he decides he probably needs to focus on finding a private-sector job.\n\nHe spends his last days as a USAID employee offering follow-up advice to the other candidates who participated in Ms. Polzins forum and speaking with a political action committee focused on supporting foreign assistance. He gets some satisfaction picturing a diaspora of USAID employees fanning out across the world  bringing their expertise into the realm of politics and private companies. But at the same time, he cant help but think about what his country has lost.\n\nWere an asset for the people of the United States, he says wistfully. When we go out, its from the American people.\n\nHis wife still remembers when USAID came to her village. Seeing those American flags gave her  she stops to ask Mr. Bradley the word for what happened to her arms. Goosebumps, he says, and she nods.\n\nThey represent America doing good, she echoes. That they are here to help."

        "content": "A man waves a Mexican flag during a protest in front of Pasadena City Hall on Thursday. News reports of the recent unrest have been watched closely in Mexico.\n\nThe action may be on the streets of Los Angeles, but fallout from the immigrant protests is roiling politics in Mexico at a delicate moment  days before Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is expected to meet President Trump in their much-anticipated inaugural face-to-face encounter.\n\nSheinbaum has been on the defensive since Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  at an Oval Office event in Trumps presence  accused the Mexican president on Tuesday of encouraging violent protests.\n\nWhile Sheinbaum has assailed the U.S. immigration raids and backed immigrants rights to protest, there is no public record of her ever having backed violence. A day before Noems accusation, she said the exact opposite and called on Mexicans in Southern California to act peacefully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, Mexican opposition figures have embraced Noems charges and enthusiastically sought to amplify them. Critics also have seized upon Sheinbaums comments last month  weeks before the L.A. protests  calling on Mexicans in the United States to mobilize against a planned U.S. tax on cash transfers to Mexico.\n\nAn opposition senator, Lily Tllez, posted a video on X last week accusing Sheinbaum of emboldening compatriots in the U.S. to violate the law without consequences, as if it were Mexico, an assertion echoed by other critics.\n\nThe barrage of accusations has put Sheinbaum in a delicate position: She is obliged to defend immigrants in the United States, as Mexican leaders have always done, but cannot be seen as inflaming bilateral tensions. Still, she has lashed out at her domestic critics as anti-patriotic.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum attends her morning news conference at the National Palace in Mexico City in April. (Marco Ugarte / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow is it that Mexicans dare to say I promoted violence in the United States? With what objective? the president asked Friday. So that theres not a good relationship between Mexico and the United States? Or, worse, that the United States does something to Mexico? They are willing to have something bad happen to the country just to indulge their hypocrisy or hate.\n\nNews coverage of the protests has transfixed Mexico, where reports have heavily sided with the immigrants against U.S. efforts to detain and deport them. Commentators have largely condemned the Trump administration actions, while the airwaves and social media are filled with mostly sympathetic accounts and video from immigrants and advocates on the ground in Southern California.\n\nSheinbaum, elected to a six-year term a year ago in a landslide vote, has a 70% public approval rating, polls indicated. Her ruling Morena bloc dominates state legislatures and the Mexican Congress. She has little to fear politically from the ire of reeling opposition parties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, in the era of social media, the Sheinbaum-as-agitator narrative has gained traction among some U.S. conservative commentators. They have depicted her as a kind of master manipulator scheming violent resistance from her perch in Mexico City.\n\nThis woman, the president of Mexico, is talking about leading an uprising in the interior of America, Charlie Kirk, a far-right talk-show host, declared June 9 in a video posted on X, where he has more than 5 million followers. And she has a lot to work with because she has a lot of sleeper cells here.\n\nIn comments last week, Sheinbaum has embraced nonviolence as a daily mantra, citing the legacies of Mahatma Gandhi, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Cesar Chavez.\n\nAny demonstration has to be peaceful, she told reporters Friday. We are always seeking, diplomatically, the defense of Mexicans outside the country.\n\nAnd, while Sheinbaum is a regular on X  where she has 4.3 million followers  she urged people not to make politics on the social media forum, where much of the polemics about her purported role in the immigrant protests has played out.\n\nHelping to fuel the controversy are the proliferation of Mexican flags at the Los Angeles protests. Sheinbaum has neither endorsed nor criticized the flag-waving, but she has expressed dismay at one widely distributed image  of a shirtless L.A. protester brandishing a Mexican flag as he stands atop a burned-out car. She has called the photo a provocation, hinting of dark motives, but has failed to clarify her suspicions.\n\nA protester is fired upon with non-lethal weapons by the L.A. Sheriffs eputies on Saturday in downtown Los Angeles. (Carlin Stiehl / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe image, Sheinbaum said Friday, doesnt fit with the millions of Mexicans who contribute to the economy of the United States and are the best of people.\n\nIn their broadsides against Sheinbaum, her opponents also have cited the presidents animated calls for Mexicans in the United States to mobilize against a completely separate issue  the Trump administrations plans to impose a 3.5% tax on foreign remittances, part of the massive White House spending bill pending in Congress.\n\nThat proposed levy has met universal condemnation in Mexico, where the cash transfers support tens of thousands of poor families and are a $64-billion-a-year economic linchpin.\n\nIn an address last month in the northeastern state of San Luis Potos, Sheinbaum called on U.S. residents of Mexican ancestry  both immigrants and those born in the United States  to send letters, emails and social media messages to Congress urging lawmakers to vote against the remittance tax.\n\nIf necessary, we are going to mobilize, declared an animated Sheinbaum, raising her right fist, the image recalling her youthful days as a left-wing student demonstrator.\n\nSheinbaum never called for street protests, much less violence. But she also never clarified whether mobilize referred to organizing rallies, bolstering diplomatic pressure or some other strategy to help thwart the remittance tax.\n\nThe clip of Sheinbaum urging people to mobilize has bounded across the internet. Its Exhibit A for those accusing her of fomenting violent protests. Some online versions have been dubbed so that Sheinbaum speaks in a heavily accented English.\n\nSince Trump took office, Sheinbaum has won wide acclaim for deftly handling sensitive bilateral issues such as tariffs and drug trafficking. As the immigrant protests spread across the United States, the Mexican president will be again walking a fine line with her U.S. counterpart in their first meeting at the Group of Seven summit, which started Sunday in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheinbaum confirmed Saturday that she planned to meet with Trump in coming days and would raise the recent treatment of Mexicans in the U.S.\n\nWe are going to defend Mexicans with dignity, she told a crowd outside Mexico City.\n\nThe Mexican leader has made it clear that she disputes the administrations view of immigrants as invaders and of L.A. demonstrators as insurrectionists.\n\nWe dont agree with the treatment of honest Mexicans who work every day for the good of the United States and pay their taxes, Sheinbaum said on Friday. Eighty percent of their earnings remain in the United States, in consumption, in taxes. And they are people who are integrated into life there.\n\nAnd Sheinbaum, who did doctoral studies for four years at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, added: California would not be what it is without Mexicans.\n\nTimes staff writer Kate Linthicum and special correspondent Cecilia Snchez Vidal contributed to this report."

        "content": "According to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics, unmarried couples who live together are staying together longer and having more babies than at any other time in the past. (Cue moral panic about: the Gays; the rise of feminism; the \"wussification\" of American men; other conservative garbage et cetera ad nauseam.)\n\nAs reported by USA Today, for almost half of the nearly 13,000 women researchers interviewed, their \"first union\" was living with an unmarried partner  not marriage. The survey also found that marriage was the \"first union\" for less than 25 percent of women, down from 39 percent in 1995.\n\nOther findings include:\n\n As a first union, 48% of women cohabited with their male partner, up from 43% in 2002 and 34% in 1995.\n\n 23% of first unions were marriages, down from 30% in 2002 and 39% in 1995. The percentage of women who cohabited as a first union increased for all races and ethnic groups, except Asian women. Among Hispanics, the percentage increased 57%; for whites, 43%; for blacks, 39%.\n\n 22 months is the median duration of first cohabitation, up from 20 months in 2002 and 13 months in 1995.\n\n 19% of women became pregnant and gave birth in the first year of a first premarital cohabitation.\n\n Within three years of cohabiting, 40% of women had transitioned to marriage; 32% remained living together; 27% had broken up.\n\nResearchers are attributing the shift to, among other factors, class, education and an evolving view of marriage:\n\nThe new data show 70% of women without a high school diploma cohabited as a first union, compared with 47% of those with a bachelor's degree or higher. Among women ages 22-44 with higher education, their cohabitations were more likely to transition to marriage by within years (53%), compared with 30% for those who didn't graduate high school. \"What we're seeing here is the emergence of children within cohabiting unions among the working class and the poor,\" [sociologist Andrew Cherlin of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore] says. \"They have high standards for marriage and they don't think they can meet them for now, but increasingly, it's not stopping them from having a child. Having children within cohabiting unions is much more common among everybody but the college educated.\"\n\nThe study also found that cohabitation is often a first step toward marriage for many couples, so don't publish your think piece on the \"death\" of the institution just yet. (But the report also found that a growing number of adults are entering long-term cohabiting relationships as an alternative to marriage, so maybe save a copy on your external hard drive.)\n\nArizona State University sociologist Sarah Hayford sums up the federal study's findings nicely: They're complicated.\n\n\"It seems like cohabiting unions are playing different roles for different people,\" she says."

Models can basically show there will be areas of intense rainfall, but they very rarely put it in the exact right spot.\n\nEfforts to close that rift are at risk. Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme rainfalls, making improvements to models all the more urgent. NOAA is working to improve forecasting tools to better predict rainfall intensity and precise location, but the Trump administrations most recent budget request for the agency, which proposes to cut the budget by more than $2 billion, would shut down much of the agencys severe storm research.\n\nWhile National Weather Service forecasters had warned broadly about flash flooding in central Texas in advance, Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said the best weather models could not predict precisely where the most intense rainfall would fall, or that the deluge would stall out over a flood-prone basin."

        "content": "By early spring, Paramount Global was in crisis. President Trump wouldnt budge from his demand for an eye-popping sum of money and an apology from the company to settle his lawsuit over a CBS News 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. Journalists at the storied broadcaster were in revolt against the parent company.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramounts board faced withering pressure, with a settlement widely seen as a prerequisite for getting government approval for the companys $8-billion sale to David Ellisons Skydance Media, or the deal would collapse.\n\nThen a new emergency erupted.\n\nOn May 4, CBS aired a hard-hitting 60 Minutes segment that took aim at Trumps targeting of law firms. Correspondent Scott Pelley anchored the report, which relied heavily on an interview with a leading Trump irritant  former top Hillary Clinton advisor Marc Elias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump was furious. He threatened Paramount with an additional lawsuit alleging defamation, according to people close to the situation who were not authorized to comment.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes drama eventually would culminate with Paramount agreeing to pay $16 million to end the presidents battle over edits to Octobers Harris interview, which Trump alleged was manipulated to boost the then-vice presidents election chances. Trumps suit had demanded $20 billion in damages.\n\nThe deal resulted from months of back-and-forth among a constellation of power players with competing interests: the president, mogul Shari Redstone, tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, Hollywood super agent Ari Emanuel, CBS News ousted leader Wendy McMahon and Jeff Shell, a former NBCUniversal chief now with RedBird Capital Partners, which backs Ellisons Skydance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe settlement, which the president approved late Tuesday, included a commitment by Trump to drop his claims and not sue over the May 60 Minutes broadcast, according to sources and a Paramount statement.\n\nParamount said it agreed to pay Trumps legal fees. The remainder of the $16-million settlement will go toward his future presidential library.\n\nLarry Ellison is a friend of mine. Hes a great guy, Trump told reporters following a Thursday night rally in Iowa. I think hes going to run CBS really well, and I think hes making a good deal to buy it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe beleaguered company behind Mission: Impossible and Yellowstone mustered victories during the negotiations, withstanding the Trump teams earlier demand for a $100-million payout, the knowledgeable sources said.\n\nThe company also refused to apologize for CBS reporting or edits, a stance to protect its journalistic ethics and 1st Amendment rights.\n\nThis settlement allows Paramount to focus on its prospective sale, and CBS can maintain its principles, said C. Kerry Fields, a business law professor at the USC Marshall School. But principle has its price, and there certainly was one set here.\n\nThe eight-month skirmish with Trump shined a harsh light on Paramounts vulnerabilities  and deep divisions within the company and its prospective new owners.\n\nParamount had a narrow window to reach a truce. The company wanted to finalize the settlement before Wednesday, when Paramount held its annual shareholder meeting and three new members joined the board.\n\nThis [settlement] was all about survival  it was that dark, Fields said. Paramount has to execute the sale to Skydance in order to survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first, Paramounts sale to the Ellison family seemed like a sure bet. Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corp., is close to Trump and his company is a possible buyer for TikTok, another deal of interest to the president. The landmark Paramount-Skydance deal, struck a year ago, could reshape one of Hollywoods original studios and the entertainment landscape.\n\nRedstone and her family agreed to part with their entertainment holdings, National Amusements Inc., and controlling Paramount shares. The familys shaky finances were a catalyst for the sale. Redstone has borrowed heavily to meet debt obligations, including a $186-million term loan from Larry Ellison last year. The family is waiting for the cash from the sale of Paramount and National Amusements to the Ellisons and RedBird, a private equity firm.\n\nBut an unexpected misstep altered the deals course.\n\nLast fall, 60 Minutes invited Trump and Harris to participate in preelection interviews. Trump agreed, then backed out. CBS News went forward with a Harris sit-down.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris talks to 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker. (CBS News)\n\nCorrespondent Bill Whitaker asked Harris about the Biden administrations rocky relations with Israels prime minister. Producers used different portions of her answer on two programs: a convoluted response on CBS Sunday morning show Face the Nation, and a more succinct part on 60 Minutes.\n\nTrump and his supporters zeroed in on the discrepancy. They accused CBS of doctoring the interview. CBS News denied the allegation, saying the edits were routine.\n\nDays before the election, Trump sued in Amarillo, Texas, ensuring the case would be overseen by a Trump-appointed judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis lawsuit alleged the 60 Minutes edits amounted to election interference  malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public, in the suits words.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in the Oval Office. (Bloomberg)\n\n1st Amendment experts said the case had no merit; some figured it was a campaign stunt.\n\nDays later, Shell, the RedBird executive who will become Paramounts president should Skydance take over, held a conference call with top CBS executives. Shell suggested 60 Minutes release the full Harris interview transcript in a bid for transparency, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nNews executives refused, drawing a clear division between some high-level Paramount executives and Ellisons team.\n\nThose Paramount executives have bristled over Shells involvement, including a comment he reportedly made to McMahon late last year, stating the company eventually would have to settle. Skydance has said it has an agreement with Paramount that gives Ellison and Shell the ability to give input on key business issues  even before acquiring Paramount.\n\nA spokesperson for Shell declined to comment.\n\nThe role of Shell, ousted from his previous role running NBCUniversal after acknowledging an inappropriate relationship with an underling, has been controversial. Representatives for the creators of South Park have accused him of overstepping his authority and meddling with a protracted negotiation over their overall deal and streaming rights to the long-running cartoon. A representative for Shell denied that accusation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump had scored previous victories over media organizations. In December, the Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay him $16 million, including $1 million for his attorney fees, to end a dispute stemming from ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurate description of Trumps liability in a civil court case. Press advocates howled.\n\nParamount held firm. But it failed to get Trumps case dismissed or moved to a court in New York, where CBS and 60 Minutes are based.\n\nSo the company was in a box. Its sale to Skydance requires the approval of the Federal Communications Commission to transfer CBS TV station licenses to the Ellisons, and that consent has been elusive.\n\nIn one of his first moves as FCC chairman, Trump appointee Brendan Carr launched an inquiry into whether CBS edits of the Harris interview rose to the level of news distortion  the crux of Trumps lawsuit.\n\nIn February, Carr demanded CBS release a raw transcript of the Harris interview and the unedited footage. CBS complied; the material showed Harris had been accurately quoted.\n\nThe Texas judge ordered Paramount and Trumps lawyers into mediation. Talks began April 30.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat weekend, 60 Minutes ran its report on Trump and the law firms, riling Redstone and others. The Trump team and Paramount were already far apart, the sources said.\n\nSoon, CBS News and Stations President Wendy McMahon was forced out. Knowledgeable sources attributed her departure to months of strife and persistent criticism from Redstone, who serves as Paramounts chair. McMahon also made missteps, including overseeing an unsuccessful reboot of CBS Evening News.\n\nHer exit followed that of Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes, who fought efforts to settle.\n\nThe day McMahon was ousted, left-leaning U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) lobbed a salvo at Redstone. In a May 19 letter, they warned that Paramount board members risked possible bribery charges if they paid Trump to settle the lawsuit as a way to win FCC approval for the Skydance deal.\n\nBy early June, Redstone and the Ellison team were getting restless.\n\nEmanuel, the agent, stepped in to help get the dealmaking back on track, people familiar with the matter said. Emanuel is Trumps former talent agent and one of Ellisons closest allies.\n\nOn June 7, Ellison met briefly with Trump at a UFC event in New Jersey. Emanuel is executive chairman of the WME Group and chief executive of UFCs parent company, TKO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a source, Emanuel associate Dana White, the Trump-supporting UFC chief executive, helped facilitate the Ellison meeting with the president, which occurred steps away from the fighters octagon.\n\nPeople close to Ellison and Emanuel declined to discuss Ellisons interactions with the president. Representatives of Skydance, Redstone and Emanuel declined to comment for this story.\n\nFinally, a breakthrough came when Trump offered support for Ellison and the Skydance deal, though he continued to blast Harris and CBS News.\n\nEllison is great, Trump said from the White House lawn on June 18. Hell do a great job with it. Late Thursday, Trump called David Ellison a fantastic young man.\n\nMeanwhile, the clock was ticking. Redstone and others wanted the board to handle the settlement before the shareholder meeting, when one director stepped down, and three new members joined the board.\n\nRedstone recused herself from voting but made her wishes known.\n\nThe settlement was finally reached about 10 hours before the Paramount board switched.\n\nOne person close to the legal effort said the agreement got over the finish line due to a sweetener for Trump. His team anticipates that Paramount networks eventually will run millions of dollars worth of free commercials, or public service announcements, in support of Trump causes, including combating antisemitism and increasing border security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also referenced the alleged side deal.\n\nWe did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million  or maybe more than that in advertising, Trump said. So [the settlement] is like $32- to maybe $35 million.\n\nParamount said it agreed to a $16-million settlement.\n\nParamounts settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs, the company said in a statement. Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties.\n\nSkydance declined to comment. Emanuel did not respond to messages.\n\nThe settlement does contain another provision championed by Trump.60 Minutes will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after those interviews air, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns, Paramount said.\n\n1st Amendment advocates were disheartened by the deal. So were Trumps enemies, including the senators who had vowed to investigate the deal for bribery.\n\nParamounts move to settle a bogus lawsuit with President Trump over a 60 Minutes report he did not like is an extremely dangerous precedent, Sanders, the U.S. senator, said in a statement. Paramounts decision will only embolden Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media."

Panelists joined Washington Week With The Atlantic last night to discuss the administrations stance on the courts, universities, government agencies, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, this week Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told voters that we are all afraid, adding that shes anxious about using her voice, because retaliation is real.\n\nIt is so pervasive, what she is talking about, Mark Leibovich said last night. Shes not talking about political intimidation like Elon Musk throwing a bunch of money at an opponent or someone being primaried. He continued, Shes talking about physical fear.\n\nMurkowskis sentiments are also not isolated, Leibovich added. Its been a real hallmark of this era, he said. Governing is supposed to take place by politics, by persuasion, by debate. Authoritarianism is by intimidation, by threat, by violence in some cases.\n\nJoining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times; Laura Barrn-Lpez, a White House Correspondent for PBS News Hour; Eugene Daniels, a senior Washington correspondent and incoming co-host of The Weekend at MSNBC; and Mark Leibovich, a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\nWatch the full episode here."

According to data from SurveyMonkey, just remove all the gun owners from the Lone Star State and it would have gone to Hillary Clinton in 2016. You can do the same thing in liberal California. Remove all the non-gun owners and the state would have voted for Donald Trump.\n\nThats how divisive the issue of gun control is in American politics.\n\nSurveyMonkey found that no other demographic  not race, religion or gender  so perfectly divided voters. In the 2016 election, 47 percent of Trump supporters said gun control was an issue important enough to influence their vote. Thats compared to just 27 percent of voters who supported Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut what does this divide mean? How is it impacting gun control policy, and how might this issue change in light of recent mass shootings like Las Vegas, Orlando and Newtown? To discuss the data, the PBS NewsHour hosted a Twitter chat 1 p.m. EDT Thursday with data journalist Dante Chinni (@Dchinni), professor and chairman of political science at the University of Kansas Don Haider-Markel (@dhmarkel), and Washington Post correspondent Philip Bump (@pbump).\n\nCheck out a recap of the conversation "

        "content": "Greg Pryor began composting yard and food waste for San Francisco in 1996, and today he oversees nine industrial-sized composting sites in California and Oregon that turn discarded banana peels, coffee grounds, chicken bones and more into a dark, nutrient-rich soil that farmers covet for their fields and crops.\n\nHis company, Recology, processes organic waste from cities and municipalities across the Bay Area, Central Valley, Northern California, Oregon and Washington  part of a growing movement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by minimizing food waste in landfills.\n\nBut, said Pryor, if bioplastic and compostable food packaging manufacturers get their way, the whole system could collapse.\n\nAt issue is a 2021 California law, known as Assembly Bill 1201, which requires that products labeled compostable must actually break down into compost, not contaminate soil or crops with toxic chemicals, and be readily identifiable to both consumers and solid waste facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law also stipulates that products carrying a compostable label must meet the U.S. Department of Agricultures National Organic Program requirements, which only allow for plant and animal material in compost feedstock, and bar all synthetic substances and materials  plastics, bioplastics and most packaging materials  except for newspaper or other recycled paper without glossy or colored ink.\n\nClose-up of text on plastic cup reading Made From Corn, referring to plant derived bioplastics. (Getty Images)\n\nThe USDA is reviewing those requirements at the request of a compostable plastics and packaging industry trade group. Its ruling, expected this fall, could open the door for materials such as bioplastic cups, coffee pods and compostable plastic bags to be admitted into the organic compost waste stream.\n\nAmid pressure from the industry, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery said it will hold off on implementing its own rules on AB 1201  originally set for Jan. 1, 2026  until June 30, 2027, to incorporate the USDA guidelines, should there be a change.\n\nPryor is concerned that a USDA ruling to allow certain plastic to be considered compost will contaminate his product, make it unsaleable to farmers, and undermine the purpose of composting  which is to improve soil and crop health.\n\nPlastics, microplastics and toxic chemicals can hurt and kill the microorganisms that make his compost healthy and valued. Research also shows these materials, chemicals and products can threaten the health of crops grown in them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while research on new-generation plastics made from plant and other organic fibers has more mixed findings  suggesting some fibers, in some circumstances, may not be harmful  Pryor said the farmers who buy his compost dont want any of it. Theyve told him they wont buy it if he accepts it in his feedstock.\n\nIf you ask farmers, hey, do you mind plastic in your compost? Every one of them will say no. Nobody wants it, he said.\n\nHowever, for manufacturers of next-generation, compostable food packaging products  such as bioplastic bags, cups and takeout containers made from corn, kelp or sugarcane fibers  those federal requirements present an existential threat to their industry.\n\nThats because California is moving toward a new waste management regime which, by 2032, will require all single-use plastic packaging products sold in the state to be either recyclable or compostable.\n\nA worker at Recologys Blossom Valley composting site rides his bike back to the sorting machines after a break in Vernalis, Calif., on June 26. (Susanne Rust / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIf the products these companies have designed and manufactured for the sole purpose of being incorporated in the compost waste stream are excluded, they will be shut out of the huge California market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey say their products are biodegradable, contain minimal amounts of toxic chemicals and metals, and provide an alternative to the conventional plastics used to make chip bags, coffee pods and frozen food trays  which wind up in landfills, rivers and oceans.\n\nAs we move forward, not only are you capturing all this material ... such as coffee grounds, but there isnt really another packaging solution in terms of finding an end of life, for these products, said Alex Truelove, senior policy manager for the Biodegradable Product Institute, a trade organization for compostable packaging producers.\n\n(Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times)\n\nMaterial is loaded into a mixing truck where biosolids and amendments are combined then stored in climate controlled piles to cure at the Tulare Lake Compost plant. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times)\n\nEven if you could recycle those little cups, which it seems like no one is willing to do ... it still requires someone to separate out and peel off the foil top and dump out the grounds. Imagine if you could just have a really thin covering or really thin packaging, and then you could just put it all in the compost he said. How much more likely would it be for people to participate?\n\nTruelove and Rhodes Yepsen, the executive director of the bioplastic institute, also point to compost bin and can liners, noting that many people wont participate in separating out their food waste if they cant put it in a bag  the yuck factor. If you create a compostable bag, they say, more people will buy into the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe institute  whose board members include or have included representatives from the chemical giant BASF Corp., polystyrene manufacturer Dart Container, Eastman Chemical Co. and PepsiCo  is lobbying the federal and state government to get its products into the compost stream.\n\nGreg Pryor, Recologys director of landfill and organics, stands in front of a pile of processed compost at the integrated waste managements Blossom Valley compost site in Vernalis, Calif., on June 26. (Susanne Rust / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe institute also works as a certifying body, testing, validating and then certifying compostable packaging for composting facilities across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, it petitioned the USDA to reconsider its exclusion of certain synthetic products, calling the current requirements outdated and one of the biggest stumbling blocks to efforts in states, such as California, that are trying to create a circular economy, in which products are designed and manufactured to be reused, recycled or composted.\n\nIn response, the federal agency contracted the nonprofit Organics Material Review Institute to compile a report evaluating the research thats been conducted on these products safety and compostability.\n\nThe institutes report, released in April, highlighted a variety of concerns including the products ability to fully biodegrade  potentially leaving microplastics in the soil  as well as their tendency to introduce forever chemicals, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and other toxic chemicals into the soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoughly half of all bioplastics produced are non-biodegradable, the authors wrote. To compensate for limitations inherent to bioplastic materials, such as brittleness and low gas barrier properties, bioplastics can contain additives such as synthetic polymers, fillers, and plasticizers. The specific types, amounts, and hazards of these chemicals in bioplastics are rarely disclosed.\n\nThe report also notes that while some products may break down relatively efficiently in industrial composting facilities, when left out in the environment, they may not break down at all. Whats more, converting to biodegradable plastics entirely could result in an increase in biodegradable waste in landfills  and with it emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, the authors wrote.\n\nYepsen and Truelove say their organization wont certify any products in which PFAS  a chemical often used to line cups and paper to keep out moisture  was intentionally added, or which is found in levels above a certain threshold. And they require 90% biodegradation of the products they certify.\n\nJudith Enck, a former regional Environmental Protection Agency director, and the founder of Beyond Plastics, an anti-plastic waste environmental group based in Bennington, Vt., said the inclusion of compost as an end-life option for packaging in Californias new waste management regime was a mistake.\n\nWhat it did was to turn composting into a waste disposal strategy, not a soil health strategy, she said. The whole point of composting is to improve soil health. But I think whats really driving this debate right now is consumer brand companies who just want the cheapest option to keep producing single-use packaging. And the chemical companies, because they want to keep selling chemicals for packaging and a lot of so-called biodegradable or compostable packaging contains those chemicals.\n\nBob Shaffer, an agronomist and coffee farmer in Hawaii, said hes been watching these products for years, and wont put any of those materials in his compost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarmers are growing our food, and were depending on them. And the soils they grow our crops in need care, he said. Ill grow food for you, and Ill grow gorgeous food for you, but give us back the food stuff youre not using or eating, so we can compost it, return it to the soil, and make a beautiful crop for you. But be mindful of what you give back to us. We cant grow you beautiful food from plastic and toxic chemicals.\n\nRecologys Pryor said the food waste his company receives has increasingly become polluted with plastic.\n\nHe pointed toward a pile of food waste at his companys composting site in the San Joaquin Valley town of Vernalis. The pile looked less like a heap of rotting and decaying food than a dirty mound of plastic bags, disposable coffee cups, empty, greasy chip bags and takeout boxes.\n\nIve been doing this for more than three decades, and I can tell you the food we process hasnt changed over that time, he said. Neither have the leaves, brush and yard clippings we bring in. The only thing thats changed? Plastics and biodegradable plastics.\n\nHe said if the USDA and CalRecycle open the doors for these next-generation materials, the problem is just going to get worse.\n\nPeople are already confused about what they can and cant put in, he said. Opening the door for this stuff is just going to open the floodgates. For all kinds of materials. Its a shame."

        "content": "Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) voted in favor of President Trumps megabill that will lead to major cuts to Medicaid, the federal healthcare program for low-income Americans.\n\nAlready a ripe target for Democrats in the next election, Central Valley Rep. David Valadao put his political future in deeper peril this week by voting in favor of legislation that slashes the Medicaid coverage essential to roughly two-thirds of his constituents.\n\nThe Republican dairy farmer from Hanford said that despite his concerns about President Trumps megabill, he voted to support it because of concessions he helped negotiate that will help his district, such as an additional $25 billion for rural hospitals, $1 billion for Western water infrastructure, and agricultural investments.\n\nMore than a half-million residents in Valadaos district are covered by the program known in California as Medi-Cal  the most of any district in the state  according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center. While preserving tax breaks benefiting the wealthy, the bill passed by narrow Republican majorities in both the House and Senate would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1.04 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nValadao said his constituents would directly benefit from several provisions in the legislation, including the extension of the tax breaks, the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, and the expansion of the child tax credit.\n\nThese are real wins that will put more money back in the pockets of hardworking families throughout the Valley, he said. No piece of legislation is perfect, but this bill ultimately reflects the priorities of [my district]  lower taxes, stronger farms, better infrastructure, and a commitment to protecting access to healthcare for Valley residents.\n\nDemocrats vowed to use Valadaos vote to oust him from office in the 2026 election. His district, which includes swaths of Kern, Kings and Tulare counties, is among the most competitive in the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nValadao has repeatedly vowed to oppose legislation that would cut healthcare for his constituents, most recently on Monday when he posted on X: Ive been clear from the start that I will not support a final reconciliation bill that makes harmful cuts to Medicaid, puts critical funding at risk, or threatens the stability of healthcare providers across his district.\n\nAfter his vote Thursday, Valadao said that he did so because it preserves Medicaid for its intended recipients  children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly.\n\nDavid Valadao just sealed his fate by voting for a bill that will rip health care away from tens of thousands in his district, where more than two-thirds of his constituents rely on the very program hes gutting, said Anna Elsasser, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in a statement. He lied to their faces, and then tried to sweep it under the rug. We all knew hed fold when it mattered most. Its spineless, its dishonest, and next November, it will cost him his seat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA billboard proclaiming David Valadao Lied. He voted to gut Medi-Cal, giving CEOs a tax break. Well pay with our lives was erected Thursday near State Route 99 in Valadaos district by Fight for Our Health, a nonprofit coalition of health, labor, senior, disability and other groups.\n\nGilbert Garcia, 68, of Bakersfield warned that the coming cuts will be absolutely devastating.\n\nThe retired grant writer for a nonprofit that serves adults with developmental disabilities is a member of the California Alliance for Retired Americans and lives in Valadaos district.\n\nWith the cuts that are taking place, I think community-based programs are just going to dissolve, which means these individuals and all the programs and employees associated with them will disappear off the map, he said.\n\nHe also is worried that the sole trauma center in the region, which saved his 10-year-old sons life more than three decades ago, will probably be shuttered because of the legislation.\n\nIn critical situations, people have minutes to reach a trauma center that has the equipment to be able to stabilize them and keep them alive, Garcia said. Theres no time to get to L.A. Theres no time to get to Fresno. People will be dead on arrival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats also plan on targeting Reps. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) and Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills) for their support of the bill. Hundreds of protesters descended Tuesday on Kims Anaheim field office to urge the congresswoman to oppose the legislation.\n\nPolitics Orange County congresswoman targeted by protests over Trump megabill, cuts to healthcare Protestors railed on Tuesday against an Orange County congresswoman who could be a critical vote on President Trumps proposal to cut more than $1 trillion in federal dollars that helped pay for healthcare for those in need.\n\nTrumps proposal narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday. Vice President JD Vance cast a tiebreaking vote because of the defection of three GOP senators who joined every Democrat in voting against it.\n\nThe legislation will dramatically overhaul the nations tax code by making tax cuts approved during the presidents first term permanent, a major benefit to corporations and the nations wealthy, while slashing funding for historic federal safety-net programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps provide food to low-income Americans.\n\nA Congressional Budget Office analysis released Sunday estimated that the Senate version of the proposal would increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034 and would result in 11.8 million Americans losing health insurance in less than a decade.\n\nThe legislation created a rift among Republicans, with some opposing the amount of money it would add to the deficit while others expressed concerns about how it would affect their constituents. But ultimately, GOP members of Congress put aside their differences to get the bill on the presidents desk by the Fourth of July, as Trump demanded.\n\nIn a marathon session that ended early Thursday morning, members of the House of Representatives voted 220 to 212  largely along party lines  to approve a procedural rule that allowed the legislation to be considered by the full body, a victory for Trump and GOP legislative leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nValadaos vote in support of the procedural vote before midnight Wednesday raised eyebrows, given the number of his constituents who rely on Medicaid, his previous willingness to oppose Trump and GOP concerns about retaining control of his seat.\n\nCal State Fresno political science professor Tom Holyoke noted that the only time Valadao lost reelection to Congress was in 2018, the middle of Trumps first term.\n\nDemocrats have been targeting Valadaos district for several election cycles because of their partys voter registration advantage in the region. His vote certainly gives the Democrats something to run on, which they havent quite had in the past, Holyoke said. Especially since Valadao said he was going to vote against the bill and then voted for it.\n\nMore than 40% of the districts voters are Democrats, while 28.3% are Republicans and 23.3% registered as having no party preference, according to the nonpartisan California Target Book, which handicaps congressional races.\n\nValadao, 48, served one term in the state Assembly before being elected to Congress in 2012. He was reelected twice before narrowly losing reelection in 2018. He retook the seat in 2020.\n\nHe drew the ire of fellow Republicans as one of 10 GOP members of Congress who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 after a violent mob of the presidents supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in the aftermath of Trumps 2020 election loss. However, Valadao did not face the same retribution from Trump that the others did, reportedly because of the congressmans long-standing relationship with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday told reporters that Valadao should leave office if he votes for the bill.\n\nIts the ultimate betrayal, he said during a news conference in Burbank. This is one of the most calamitous and devastating bills of our lifetime.\n\nNewsom predicted that the bills passage would mean hospital closures, loss of access to healthcare and food stamps for Californians, and higher student loans.\n\nValadao might as well resign early and I can call a special election, if he supports it, Newsom said. What basis do you have of trust in your own district if you would betray your own constituency to such an extraordinary, extraordinary degree. Its one of the poorest districts in the country."

        "content": "BRICS summit ends with calls for less confrontation in the world\n\nLeaders in the BRICS group of emerging economies ended their recent summit with calls for less confrontation in the world. But that plea didn't go over well with President Trump.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nTariffs came up at the annual meeting of BRICS over the weekend. That stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The group of emerging economies, which actually includes more countries now, has challenged what it sees as U.S. dominance in global affairs. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for less global confrontation, but that didn't go over well with President Trump. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports.\n\nCARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: The BRICS 31-page summit statement covered a lot of international territory and plenty of criticism among those who called out the, quote, \"indiscriminate rising of tariffs\" but stopped short of directly naming the U.S. or Trump. That toned-down declaration by BRICS leaders and diplomats apparently wasn't cautious enough, says Oliver Stuenkel with Brazil's FGV University.\n\nOLIVER STUENKEL: They probably believed that they could fly below the radar of Trump as long as they didn't mention the United States, but that clearly failed.\n\nKAHN: Trump followed with a terse post on social media threatening to slap an additional 10% tariff on, quote, \"any country aligning themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS.\" Founding member South Africa entered into the Trump fray. Its president said the powerful can't seek vengeance against, quote, \"those who are seeking to do good in the world.\" Trump announced 30% tariffs on South African goods starting August 1.\n\nThere had been worries that the BRICS group was losing relevance as it continued to expand beyond its original members. Consensus among the divergent countries, now including Indonesia and several Middle Eastern nations, has been difficult. However, the group did manage to dial down criticism of its own. Russia's Vladimir Putin faced no rebuke over the war in Ukraine, and Iran was called out not for its nuclear program but as a victim of Israeli airstrikes. Brazil's president tried to end on a positive note and not let Trump's tariff threats draw too much focus.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nKAHN: \"We are a group wanting to create another way,\" said Lula, \"with more focus on human relations and development and not confrontation.\"\n\nCarrie Kahn, NPR News, Rio de Janeiro.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR.

Authorities blocked major roads leading into the capital, Nairobi, and most businesses closed amid the strictest measures yet to contain the unrest.\n\nProtesters lit bonfires and threw stones at police. Police fired and hurled tear gas canisters, injuring demonstrators. Young men carried another man, his shirt drenched in blood, saying he had been shot. The protests were reported in 17 of 47 counties.\n\nSaba Saba Day demonstrations in Nairobi on Monday. Luis Tato / AFP via Getty Images\n\nKenyan youth and others for weeks have been protesting police brutality and poor governance while demanding President William Rutos resignation over alleged corruption and the high cost of living.\n\nJuly 7, known as Saba Saba, is a significant date in Kenyas history, marking the first major protests 35 years ago that called on then-President Daniel arap Moi  Rutos mentor  for a transition from a one-party state to a multiparty democracy, which was realized in the 1992 elections. Saba Saba is Swahili for Seven Seven.\n\nPolice officers on Monday stopped private and public vehicles from accessing Nairobis city center. They also blocked most pedestrians from entering the capital, only allowing those deemed to have essential duties. Roads leading to parliament  stormed in a protest last year  and the presidents office were barricaded using razor wire.\n\nThere is no reversing the Gen Z Saba Saba-like spirit, said Macharia Munene, professor of history and international relations at United States International University Africa in Nairobi. Attempt to criminalize protests is reactive and will not work. It instead makes the government appear retrogressive and desperate enough to subvert the constitution.\n\nKenyan police fired tear gas during the clashes in Nairobi. Simon Maina / AFP via Getty Images\n\nInterior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said on Sunday that the government would not tolerate violent protests and police would be deployed to ensure public safety. Last month, Murkomen told police to shoot on sight anyone who approaches police stations during protests after several had been burned.\n\nPublic Service Minister Geoffrey Ruku had urged all government employees to report to work on Monday, insisting that the demonstrations would not disrupt public services.\n\nIn Kitengela town in Nairobis outskirts, police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who had lit bonfires on the road that connects to neighboring Tanzania.\n\nThey have blocked the roads, blocking us from our work. I am a roadside vendor and I am supposed to get to town and buy merchandise to sell along the road, said protester Caleb Okoth. What do they want us to eat? People are being beaten like dogs for protesting for their rights.\n\nProtesters chant anti-government slogans and wave Kenyan flags beside a burning barricade. Luis Tato / AFP via Getty Images\n\nKenyas latest wave of violent demonstrations was sparked by calls for police accountability following the death of a blogger in police custody last month. During protests on June 17, a police officer shot a civilian at close range, further angering the public.\n\nOn June 25, at least 19 people were killed and more than 400 injured during protests against police brutality that were timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of anti-tax protests where parliament was stormed and over 60 people lost their lives."

        "content": "A US military veteran, previously pardoned by Donald Trump for his role in the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, was sentenced to life in prison this week for plotting to attack an FBI office and assassinate other law enforcement officers.\n\nEdward Kelley, 36, was found guilty last November of trying to attack officers who investigated him over his actions at the US Capitol in Washington DC when pro-Trump supporters tried stormed the building in hopes, ultimately in vain, of stopping the certification of Joe Bidens presidential victory over Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nKelley was one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol on January 6 after rioters broke through police lines, according to justice department documents. He then made plans to attack the FBI office in Knoxville, Tennessee, with car bombs and explosives attached to drones. He also developed a kill list of law enforcement officers he wanted to assassinate.\n\nPreviously, a judge found that Trumps pardon did not apply to this case, saying that his prosecution could continue.\n\nLast November, after a three-day jury trial, he was convicted of conspiracy to murder federal employees, solicitation to commit a crime of violence and influencing a federal official by threat, the justice department said.\n\nAustin Carter, another man who plotted with Kelley in 2022 to assassinate the FBI employees, pleaded guilty to the charges and became a cooperating witness. Carter testified against Kelley, saying that he and Kelley planned the attacks.\n\nHe also testified that the conspirators strategized about assassinating FBI employees in their homes and in public places such as movie theaters, the justice department said.\n\nProsecutors recommended a life sentence for Kelley, saying he was remorseless for his actions. Kelley had served in the US Marine Corps for eight years and was discharged in 2015. Last year, Kelley was found guilty, in a separate case, of three felonies, including assaulting law enforcement, civil disorder and destruction of government property.\n\nOn his first day back in office this January, Trump issued pardons and commutations for nearly 1,500 people convicted of storming the Capitol on 6 January 2021 during the insurrection. On that day, Trump told his supporters at a rally prior to the attack to fight like hell to overturn his defeat. Trump was impeached for inciting the insurrection but was acquitted by the US Senate, allowing him to run for office again.\n\nAnother January 6 defendant was recently revealed to be working within the justice department as an adviser to Ed Martin, a justice department advocate for the insurrectionists. Martin is the leader of the Trump administrations weaponization working group, which was established in February to analyze instances during the Biden administration in which a departments or agencys conduct appears to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice or legitimate governmental objectives, a justice department memo says."

There is no other area of law where the president or executive gets that level of deference.\n\nThe appellate panel sharply questioned both sides during Tuesdays hearing, appearing to reject the federal governments assertion that courts had no right to review the presidents actions, while also undercutting Californias claim that Trump had overstepped his authority in sending troops to L.A. to quell a rebellion against the authority of the United States.\n\nAll three judges seemed skeptical of the arguments that each party was making in its most extreme form, said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York Universitys Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was impressed with the questions, she went on. I think they were fair questions, I think they were hard questions. I think the judges were wrestling with the right issues.\n\nThe ruling Thursday appeared to return the issue to U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer.\n\nIts timing  late in the evening on the federal Juneteenth holiday  was likely intended to give the lower court a chance to review the decision ahead of Fridays planned hearing in San Francisco, where California sought to block Trump from using federalized soldiers to assist in immigration raids, court watchers said.\n\nUnlike Breyer, whose temporary restraining order on June 12 would have returned control of the National Guard to California, the appellate court largely avoided the question of whether the facts on the ground in Los Angeles amounted to a rebellion.\n\nInstead, the ruling focused on the limits of presidential power.\n\nBennetts opinion directly refuted the argument  made by Assistant Atty. Gen. Brett Shumate in Tuesdays hearing  that the decision to federalize National Guard troops was unreviewable.\n\nDefendants argue that this language precludes review, the judge wrote. [But Supreme Court precedent] does not compel us to accept the federal governments position that the President could federalize the National Guard based on no evidence whatsoever, and that courts would be unable to review a decision that was obviously absurd or made in bad faith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also quoted at length from the 1932 Supreme Court decision in Sterling vs. Constantin, writing [t]he nature of the [presidents] power also necessarily implies that there is a permitted range of honest judgment as to the measures to be taken in meeting force with force, in suppressing violence and restoring order.\n\nShumate told the judge he didnt know the case when Bennett asked him about it early in Tuesdays hearing.\n\nThat is a key case in that line of cases, and the fact he was not aware of it is extraordinary, Goitein said.\n\nMerriam agreed  to a point.\n\nThats a nightmare we have in law school  its a nightmare Ive had as an appellate judge, the scholar said.\n\nHowever, its actually a good thing that the attorney representing the U.S. was not planning to talk about martial law in front of the 9th Circuit, Merriam said.\n\nOne thing Thursdays ruling did not touch is whether the administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act by deputizing the military to act as civilian law enforcement  an allegation California leveled in its original complaint but which Breyer effectively tabled last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act claim has not been resolved because it was essentially not ripe last Thursday, when troops had just arrived, Goitein said. It is ripe now.\n\nEven if the 9th Circuit agrees with the federal government on everything, we could see a ruling from the district court next week that could limit what troops can do on the ground, she said.\n\nIn court Friday morning, Breyer asked both sides to brief him on whether he or the 9th Circuit had power to rule on that issue, leaving the question open through at least Monday.\n\nIn the meantime, residents of an increasingly quiet Los Angeles will have to live with the growing number of federal troops.\n\n[Congress] didnt limit rebellion to specific types of facts, Merriam said. As much as [Angelenos] might say, This is crazy! Theres not a rebellion going on in L.A. right now, this is where we are with the law."

Carl DeFazio, a private investigator hired by the family, which NBC confirmed with his wife, said that the night Tarrence went missing, his wife had gone to bed early.\n\nTarrence stayed up late to watch TV, according to DeFazio, before he went on his late-night stroll with his phone  but not his passport.\n\n\"She got up two times, checked on him,\" DeFazio said. \"He was watching TV or whatever. And then when she got up at 7 a.m., he was gone.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson previously said the agency is \"aware of a U.S. citizen missing in Turks and Caicos.\"\n\n\"When a U.S. citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts, and we make every effort to keep lines of communication open with families as appropriate,\" the spokesperson said last week. \"The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad. We stand ready to provide consular assistance to U.S. citizens in need and their families.\""

        "content": "Extreme temperatures soared across Europe on Wednesday as several countries issued heat alerts, with a Swiss power company shutting down one of its reactor units, France partially closing the Eiffel Tower and two people in Spain dying in a heat wave.\n\nIn Switzerland, energy company Axpo shut down one of the reactor units at its Beznau nuclear power plant because of high water temperature in the River Aare. The plant, which typically takes cooling water from the river for use before returning it, is prevented from doing so by Swiss regulations when temperatures reach 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher to avoid causing damage to aquatic fauna and flora.\n\nDue to the high river water temperatures, Axpo has been increasingly reducing the output of the two reactor units at the Beznau nuclear power plant for days, the company said in a statement Wednesday, adding that one unit was currently operating at 50% capacity.\n\nIn France, the national weather service Wednesday issued a rare red alert in four regions where the heat wave was expected to last until 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET).\n\nIn Paris, officials said the Eiffel Tower's top level would remain closed to visitors because of the current heat wave. According to its website, rising temperatures cause the puddled iron of the tower to expand in size and tilt slightly, but without causing any impact to its structural integrity.\n\nA labourer shields from the sun as he works on a construction site of tramway lines along the Garonne river during a heatwave in Bordeaux, south-western France on July 1, 2025. Christophe Archambault / AFP via Getty Images\n\nFrench Environment Minister Agns Pannier-Runacher said at a news conference Wednesday that firefighters had responded to more than 300 weather-related emergencies.\n\nMeanwhile, a wildfire in Spains Catalonia region killed two people Tuesday, Prime Minister Pedro Snchez said.\n\nMy sympathy goes out to all those affected and my gratitude to the emergency services working to extinguish the fire, Snchez wrote in a post on X on Wednesday, adding, In these months of heightened risk, please let us take extreme precautions.\n\nIn a separate post on X, Catalonias civil protection services said Wednesday that it was still working to extinguish the fire that was ablaze in three different areas and warned of a high risk of forest fires in two more.\n\nSpain recorded its hottest June to date with temperatures passing 40 C (104 F) in some of its cities Tuesday.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the national weather service said last month's mean temperature of 16.9 C (62F) was the second warmest June recorded in the country since record keeping began in 1884.\n\nStudies have shown that climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves around the world. As the world continues to warm, these extremes are expected to compound, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nEurope is the worlds fastest-warming continent, according to the European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service, which said the region is heating up at twice the global average speed.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the heat wave underscored the need for climate adaptation by moving away from fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change, according to the U.N.s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nRising temperatures, rising seas, floods, droughts, and wildfires threaten our rights to life, to health, to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and much more, Turk said.\n\nOther European countries also felt the sweltering effects.\n\nVisitors to Rome's landmarks sought shade amid sweltering temperatures. Tiziana Fabi / AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Italian Health Ministry issued heat wave red alerts for 16 cities, including Rome and Milan. In 13 regions, including Lombardy and Emilia, people were advised not to venture outdoors for work during the hottest periods of the day.\n\nTwo people in the country died from separate heat-related causes, including a 47-year-old working on a construction site near Bologna.\n\nIn Turkey, wildfires burned for a second day and more than 50,000 people were evacuated by rescuers Wednesday, according to the AFAD emergency management authority.\n\nThe blistering temperatures were caused by a heat dome, a high-pressure system that stalled over western Europe, trapping hot air from northern Africa over the region  akin to a lid on a pot of boiling water. Heat domes can linger for days or weeks, driving up heat and humidity for extended periods of time."

        "content": "The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine, and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russias state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month.\n\nIn the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Departments Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatoms director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.\n\nGoods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests.\n\nThe Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. The plant has frequently been disconnected from Ukraines power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.\n\nWhile the plant is still physically operated by Ukrainian staff, Rosatom manages it. The Energy Department warned Rosatom in the letter that it is unlawful for any Russian citizens or entities to handle the US technology.\n\nCNN has reached out to Rosatom for comment.\n\nIt is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities, the letter says, such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.\n\nIt is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. The Energy Departments National Nuclear Security Administration told CNN in a statement that the letter is authentic.\n\nThe letters were first reported by the news outlet RBC Ukraine.\n\nThe Department of Energys National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate, said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nShe added, The Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorizing the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.\n\nAnother letter from Ferkile to the Energy Departments Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.\n\nThe Energy Departments Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security in Ukraine.\n\nCorrection: This post incorrectly described the news outlet which first reported the letters. It was RBC Ukraine."

        "content": "WASHINGTON  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the North Korean crisis will continue until the first bomb drops.\n\nThat statement comes despite President Donald Trumps tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nations leader, Kim Jong Un.\n\nI think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table. And we have spent substantial time actually perfecting those, Tillerson told CNNs State of the Union on Sunday. But be clear: The president has also made clear to me that he wants this solved diplomatically. Hes not seeking to go to war.\n\nRecent mixed messaging from the top of the U.S. government has raised concerns about the potential for miscalculation amid the increasingly bellicose exchange of words by Trump and the North Korean leader.\n\nTrump told the U.N. General Assembly last month that if the U.S. is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Trump also tweeted that Koreas leadership wont be around much longer if it continued its provocations, a declaration that led the Norths foreign minister to assert that Trump had declared war on our country.\n\nTillerson acknowledged during a recent trip to Beijing that the Trump administration was keeping open direct channels of communications with North Korea and probing the Norths willingness to talk. He provided no elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions.\n\nSoon after, Trump took to Twitter, saying he had told our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man  Save your energy Rex, well do what has to be done! Trump offered no further explanation, but he said all military options are on the table for dealing with North Koreas nuclear and missile programs.\n\nAnalysts have speculated about whether the president and his top diplomat were playing good cop, bad cop with North Korea, and how China might interpret the confusing signals from Washington. Beijing is the Norths main trading partner, and the U.S. is counting on China to enforce U.N. sanctions.\n\nRest assured that the Chinese are not confused in any way what the American policy towards North Korea (is) or what our actions and efforts are directed at, Tillerson said.\n\nAsked if Trumps tweets undermined Tillerson, the secretary said: I think what the president is doing is hes trying to motivate action on a number of peoples part, in particular the regime in North Korea. I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table and we have spent substantial time perfecting those.\n\nHe added that Trump has made it clear to me to continue my diplomatic efforts, which we are, and Ive told others those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops.\n\nNorth Korea has launched missiles that potentially can strike the U.S. mainland and recently conducted its largest ever underground nuclear explosion. It has threatened to explode another nuclear bomb above the Pacific."

        "content": "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from barring Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood under a provision of the Republicans' sweeping tax and spending package.\n\nMassachusetts U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued the temporary restraining order, directing the Health and Human Services Department to \"take all steps necessary to ensure that Medicaid funding continues to be disbursed in the customary manner and timeframes\" to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe order will remain in effect for 14 days, and the judge will hear arguments on July 21 on whether to grant a longer pause on a provision of the administration's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which President Donald Trump signed into law on Friday.\n\n\"Were grateful that the court acted swiftly to block this unconstitutional law attacking Planned Parenthood providers and patients,\" Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts and Planned Parenthood Association of Utah said in a joint statement.\n\n\"Already, in states across the country, providers and health center staff have been forced to turn away patients who use Medicaid to get basic sexual and reproductive health care because President Trump and his backers in Congress passed a law to block them from going to Planned Parenthood,\" the statement said. \"There are no other providers who can fill the gap if the defunding of Planned Parenthood is allowed to stand. The fight is just beginning, and we look forward to our day in court.\"\n\nThe provision bans state Medicaid funding to health care groups \"primarily engaged\" in family planning services, reproductive health and related medical care, including abortions, for one year.\n\nFederal law prohibits health care providers from using federal Medicaid funds for abortions, unless the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother or is a result of rape or incest.\n\nWhile the provision of the big beautiful bill\" doesn't directly name Planned Parenthood, the group alleged in its lawsuit Monday that the legislation is \"a naked attempt to leverage the governments spending power to attack and penalize Planned Parenthood and impermissibly single it out for unfavorable treatment.\"\n\nThe group claimed that the law violates its equal protection rights and retaliates against its protected speech.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Planned Parenthood said the law would have \"catastrophic\" consequences on the organization and its local affiliates around the country, which also provide nonabortion services, like contraception, and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\"Many Planned Parenthood Members will be required to lay off staff and curtail services, with serious adverse consequences for the many patients served at those centers even if they do not use Medicaid to access services,\" the lawsuit read. \"Worse still, Members may be forced to shutter a substantial number of their health centers nationwide, many of which are in rural or underserved areas without alternative providers.\"\n\nAs a result of the one-year funding ban, Planned Parenthood said 200 of its health centers are at risk of closure, and over 1 million patients could lose access to care. More than 90% of the clinics at risk are in states where abortion is still legal, the group said.\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment on the ruling and has yet to file any court documents in the case.\n\nKatie Daniel, the legal affairs director and policy counsel for SBA Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion advocacy group, lambasted Planned Parenthood's lawsuit.\n\nPlanned Parenthoods desperation is showing as they run to the courts again to fix a crisis of their own making. Life is winning and the nations abortion giant wont be missed as their long decline continues, Daniel said."

        "content": "Many institutions got rid of their specimens, likely disposing of them as medical waste or, in some cases, passing them on to the Mtter. Collections of pathological specimens came to be associated more with P. T. Barnum-style sideshows than with medical scholarship, although the two categories hadnt always been clearly delineated. Theres been a lot of resistance to the idea that medical schools even had collections like this, McLeary said. Someone at Penn was, like, I dont believe we ever had a collection like the Mtters.  (They did.) I think theyve been memory-holed.\n\nThe Mtter might have become an obscure collection, of interest mostly to historians, if not for a woman named Gretchen Worden. In 1974, Worden wrote to the Mtters curator asking for a job. She had a degree in anthropology from Temple University and no full-time work experience. As for vital statistics, I was born in Shanghai, China, on September 26, 1947. I have since grown to a height of five feet, eight and three-quarters inches and can get things down from a seven-foot shelf. I am fairly proficient in English, barely proficient in French, and have forgotten most of my Russian, she wrote. In lieu of a rsum, she included her college transcript. Worden was hired, and spent the rest of her life at the museum.\n\nAnatomical collections like the Mtters had long inspired feelings of fascination and shame about the human body. In Victorian London, the proprietors of anatomical displays were sometimes prosecuted for indecency. For many years, the Hunterian museum was open only to medical professionals, learned men, or respectably dressed persons. But Worden, who became the Mtters director, promoted the museum through multiple appearances on David Lettermans late-night talk show, where she showed off objects that made the audience groan or erupt in shocked laughter. (Good Lord, you can hear someone say, after she shows Letterman a photograph of a wax model with gnarly facial lesions.) She and the publisher Laura Lindgren invited artists, including William Wegman, to photograph the collection for a calendar distributed in bookstores around the country. Worden also cultivated the museums distinctive Victorian atmosphere: heavy velvet drapes, red carpets, wooden cases packed with specimens. As some institutions got rid of their anatomical collections, Worden snapped them up. I am almost totally fulfilled here in this job. Its everything. Its art, its science, its bones, its anatomy, pathology, its contemporary medicine. I just couldnt be happier, she once told the Philadelphia Daily News.\n\nRegal and unapologetically odd, Worden shaped the museum in her image. Questions of spectacle and propriety circled the Mtter even then, but Wordens ample charisma, her confidence in the validity of her own fascination, seemed largely able to keep them at bay. She saw the museum as a place for humans looking at humans, somewhere that treats people as if theyre grown up enough to take a look at whats under the hood. By the end of her tenure, attendance had grown more than tenfold.\n\nWorden died in 2004, at fifty-six, after a brief illness. An article in the Times noted the motley crowd that gathered for her memorial service at the museum, which included dignified-looking surgeons, Philadelphia society matrons, and a couple of sideshow impresarios. The mourners sang Babies in Jars, a song composed to the tune of My Favorite Things.\n\nValerie DeLeon, the anthropologist, began a two-year stint as the president of the American Association for Anatomy in 2021, as her field was coming under intense scrutiny for its treatment of human remains. DeLeon convened a task force to devise best practices for institutions with historical collections of remains, an area with hardly any regulatory guidance. She felt that it was important to move quickly. The members that I represent needed help now, she told me. (The University of Florida, where she is a professor, was weighing how to handle its own anatomical teaching collections.) The task force included anthropologists, anatomists, and museum professionals. They agreed that it was important to treat human specimens with dignity and respect, but they disagreed about what that meant in practice. Some argued that, given the presumptive unethical taint of such collections, human remains should be buried or otherwise respectfully disposed of. Another faction argued that the societal benefits of continuing to research, teach with, and display human remains outweighed the harms to people who were, after all, long dead.\n\nHuman tissues hold an ethically intermediary place between inanimate property and living beings, the members of the task force wrote in a report, which was published in The Anatomical Record last year. First, the group had some thorny discussions, DeLeon said. Just how much of a body counted as a person? Did a bone shard have the same level of personhood as a full skeleton? What about teeth, or tumor cells? Should fetal remains be considered part of the mother or a separate person? Did the long dead occupy a different status from those who had died more recently?\n\nIn the report, the group laid out its guidelines, which recommend taking cultural context into account when determining how to display or dispose of remains, given that practices such as cremation or postmortem display may be considered traditional by one culture and taboo by another. Whenever possible, the A.A.A. recommends consulting with communities of caredescendants or others with an interest in and a connection to the remains. But its not always clear who is best positioned to speak for the dead. For many remains, even within my own institution, we literally have no idea where they came from, DeLeon said. So what do you do with those?\n\nIn Philadelphia, I met Kate Quinn, the Mtters executive director, in one of the College of Physicians anterooms, whose walls were lined with mahogany bookshelves and oil paintings of eminent physicians. Quinn had an air of guarded professionalism, and for most of the interview she was flanked by both a P.R. representative and her new boss, Larry Kaiser, a thoracic surgeon who had recently been named the president and C.E.O. of the College of Physicians.\n\nCartoon by Hartley Lin Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nAfter Quinns hiring, in 2022, she quickly moved to professionalize the Mtter, helping to establish policies for ethics and beginning the process of applying for accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums. She sometimes received calls from people who had been told by Dhody that the Mtter might acquire their body parts; Quinn told them that the museum wasnt doing that at the moment. She oversaw an audit of the collection, the first in more than eighty years. I had the expectation that we would find that maybe two or three per cent of the collection had been given to us with consent, she told me. But were finding its much, much less than that.\n\nStacey Mann, a consultant who was brought in by Quinn, told me it seemed that the collection was haphazardly catalogued, with some things apparently acquired because of their value as curiosities rather than as medically informative specimens. They found two of these baby skulls in the library that were linked to this woman who was, I guess, a murderess, Mann said. (The bodies were discovered in a trunk after the woman, Stella Williamson, died, in 1980; the exact circumstances of their deaths are unclear. The museum is helping to arrange a reburial.) Every month, thered be another thing that was, like, Are you kidding me? \n\nQuinn also spearheaded something called the Postmortem project, an example of the kind of institutional self-critique that has become popular in the museum world in the past few years. At the Mtter, this has meant providing visitors with visual annotations to the existing collection in the form of green signs. Near the entrance, for example, a sepia-tinged photograph shows the back of a womans head. A matted lock of hair trails down her back in calligraphic spirals, an example of plica, a rare disorder. Like many objects in the Mtters collection, it is unsettlingly compelling, the distance of time imbuing the pathology with a kind of poetry. This photo comes from a book of hair samples doctors took from patients with different ethnic backgrounds, the Postmortem sign affixed to the display reads. Is this just a picture of hair when you know that it was used to perpetuate racism? One of the museums temporary galleries is devoted to the Postmortem project, and its atmospherewhite painted walls; bright, clean light; exhibits with clear, legible signagefeels like a portal into an entirely different institution. Next to a display about power and consent, visitors are invited to contribute their responses on butcher paper: SCARY PEOPLE, acknowledge the ugly past, Wokeness destroys truth."

        "content": "Zohran Mamdani barely slept the night before primary day. At 5:30 A.M. on Tuesday, the citys hottest day in more than a decade, he welcomed reporters to a press conference in Astoria Park, Queens, a patch of green overlooking the East River, not far from his rent-stabilized apartment. As the day broke, the sky behind the candidate blazed white. Mamdani stood behind a bare podium and scrolled with an index finger on his phone, reading a short speech decrying the architects of the citys affordability crisishe called out his main opponent, the disgraced former governor Andrew Cuomoand promising a way to sustain the city. As he read, his right hand trembled slightly.\n\nMamdani, dressed in a black suit despite the temperatures climb toward a hundred degrees, was asked what, if anything, about his campaign had surprised him. The pace at which we became the clear contrast to Andrew Cuomo surprised me, he said. The velocity of events in the past few weeks had shocked even the candidate, and he still sounded like a man preparing for the very real possibility of defeat. We emerged as the clear second place in this race far before we had expected, Mamdani added. Later, sitting on a warm curb in Jackson Heights, we discussed his struggles to reach the citys Black voters in particular. I understand that when I go into a church and Im speaking to voters who have been casting votes in mayoral elections for decades, and who have known politicians for a similar period of time, that to learn someones name and cast aside all that they have known in the same instance is a difficult task, he told me. I started this race at one-per-cent name recognition. Much of this race has been one of introduction.\n\nI asked Mamdani what he planned to do if he came second to Cuomo in the primary. Would he attempt to run in the general election this fall on the progressive Working Families Party ballot line, and challenge the Democratic Party from the outside? My only focus has been on today, I tell you that sincerely, he said. I asked him, if he beat Cuomo, whether he would call on the former governor to drop out, instead of running in the general election as an independent, as Cuomo had vowed to do. Mamdani smiled and said, Im going to spend the rest of the day thinking about that.\n\nMamdani, I now say with the understatement of a guilty party, was underrated by his opponents, and by the press. Perhaps not at the start of the campaign, this winter, when he was, by his own description, a no-name, but definitely by the end, when his campaign transcended the typical bounds of municipal political debate. (Around 8 A.M. on primary day, Mamdanis team escorted him to a secret meeting, which turned out to be a video recording with Emily Ratajkowski.) When he canvassed in the Jackson HeightsRoosevelt Avenue station, one of the busiest subway terminals in the city, one out of every dozen or so voters came undone at the sight of him. Oh, my God, thank you so much! a young commuter wearing large headphones, a nose ring, and a tote bag bearing the inscription Gender Affirming Health Care Saves Lives said. A woman in scrubs gasped, pulled down her face mask, and whipped out her phone to show Mamdani a picture of her I VOTED sticker. In the Bronx, near Yankee Stadium, a group of schoolkids passed by him in a frenzy. I seen him on TV! one shouted. Mamdani shook their hands and each walked off as if theyd been bestowed a prize. He came out to us, a Black woman named Rosa, who recorded the scene on her phone, said. This is what politicians used to do. In northern Manhattan, he was meeting on the street with a group of volunteers when a rival, smaller group of volunteers wearing Cuomo T-shirts walked by. One of the Cuomo volunteers stopped to ask Mamdani to take a selfie with him.\n\nLast Friday night, Mamdani walked the length of Manhattan from Inwood to Battery Park. The resulting campaign video, which captured New Yorkers of all stripes alongside their young, would-be leader on the move, was beautiful, a portrait of the city on a hot summer night. But, as we talked on the curb in Jackson Heights, it was clear that Mamdani bristled at being reduced to a whiz-bang social-media candidate. Hed campaigned on a set of policy goalsslightly higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a rent freeze for rent-stabilized apartments, free buses, universal child care, and morethat had helped him build support, and shouldnt that count for something in a democracy? It does when you get the votes. It seems that on Tuesday, he redrew the citys political maps, drawing notable support in upper Manhattan, eastern Queens, and South Brooklynareas that were thought to be solid Cuomo territory. As of Wednesday morning, Mamdani had tallied 43.5 per cent of first-choice votes in the citys ranked-choice electoral system, with ninety-three per cent of expected votes reported, virtually guaranteeing his victory when the lower-ranking candidates votes get redistributed.\n\nOne public service that Mamdani has already rendered to the city: all but ending the long, consequential, and noxious political career of Cuomo, who was attempting a rehabilitation four years after resigning as governor in a sexual-harassment and abuse-of-power scandal. In his campaign, Cuomo insisted that the city was in chaos and that only he could fix it, while avoiding direct contact with voters and the press. He led in every poll conducted of the race until its closing days; marshalled endorsements among the citys most senior and powerful politicians, labor unions, and community leaders; and carried himself as if victory were inevitable. Cuomo spent nearly eleven years as governor, and every year he accrued more power, until in the end he was arguably the most powerful governor in the history of the state. His mania reached such a state that he signed a five-million-dollar book deal to write a memoir bragging about his pandemic leadership before there was even a vaccine, and while scores of New Yorkers were still dying of COVID every week. In the end, he got rinsed in a primary by a thirty-three-year-old socialist whom he out-fund-raised by more than twenty-five million dollars. Quite simply, Cuomo underestimated how tired New Yorkers were of him. On Tuesday night, Brad Lander, the citys comptroller, who came in third in the race, after he and Mamdani cross-endorsed each other in the campaigns final days, said what many voters were thinking: Good fucking riddance.\n\nOn the curb in Jackson Heights, Mamdani and I had talked about the new New York, shaped by a youth coalition and class-conscious messaging, and the old New York, defined by ethnic blocs, institutions, and neighborhoods. He called age a defining aspect of the election, but he insisted that the old and the new didnt have to be in conflict. Ive been heartened in many of my conversations with older New Yorkers, whove told me that they were introduced to the campaign by their son or their daughter, their niece or their nephew, he said. I think its indicative of a new generation of leadership. Preliminary results on Tuesday showed Mamdani trailing Cuomo in the citys poorest neighborhoods by an aggregate thirteen per cent, a fact that suggests how much work Mamdani has ahead of him to establish himself as the candidate of the citys working class. Mamdani said that the runaway cost of living in the city was universal, even if it was experienced more intensely by those at the bottom of the citys economy. Both renters and homeowners, he said, are feeling the squeeze. One in four New Yorkers are living in poverty, and yet we know that far more New Yorkers are living in a state of permanent anxiety as to whether or not they can keep affording the city, he told me. And that anxiety extends through multiple income brackets, and it showcases the way in which this is a crisis that is suffocating many rungs of life across these five boroughs, and a crisis that is threatening to make this a city that once was where you could make it now just where you can spend it."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Anthony Senecal, onetime butler at Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, seemed like such a nice if slightly reserved old man in this New York Times puff piece two months ago, where he shared charming observations from his years working for the mogul. It was a sweet little story that offered some insights into Trump. Senecal himself came off as almost a stereotype of the loyal household servant, something of a cross between Mr. Belvedere and the sort of Florida retiree who regularly hits the early-bird specials in every chain restaurant on Biscayne Boulevard.\n\nWho would have guessed from that piece that Senecal is also a racist lunatic? Yet there are his Facebook posts, uncovered by Mother Jones and splashed all over the Internet on Wednesday. In them, the former butler suggested that our pus headed president and kenyan (sic) fraud should be hung for treason, among other amiable entreaties.\n\nAfter the Mother Jones story published, Senecal spoke to NBCs Alexandra Jaffe. Given a chance to blame the posts on something out of his control (temporary insanity, drunkenness, brain damage caused by years of inhaling Trumps hairspray), he instead doubled down. He expressed his anger at the hordes of Muslims he apparently believes are overrunning American cities and suggested they should all be shot at the shore instead of being allowed to immigrate. And just for good measure, he suggested Obama should be hung from the portico of the White Mosque.\n\nOn the plus side, the Secret Service, which investigates all threats against the president, is currently providing Trump with protection, so it will be easy for agents to track Senecal down and interview him.\n\nBy the end of the day, the Trump campaign was in damage-control mode, although insisting that Senecal has not worked at Mar-a-Lago for many years is more than a little disingenuous. (The Times profile said that the butler retired in 2009, but that Trump had insisted he stay on as the unofficial staff historian, and he makes money leading tours of the estate.)\n\nThis is shocking news. The part about Trump promptly disavowing Senecal, I mean. The fact that an angry racist birther worked for Trump for many years (yes, Senecal appears to also be a birther) without his boss either noticing or, worse, caring? Eh, he seems to fit right in with the rest of the Trump organization.\n\nThis is, after all, the same Donald Trump who stood by campaign manager Corey Lewandowski when allegations surfaced of the latters penchant for directing abuse and misogyny at female co-workers. The same Donald Trump who has been slow to disavow endorsements from white supremacists like David Duke all throughout this campaign. The same Donald Trump who let a known white nationalist onto his list of convention delegates from California. The same Donald Trump who employed as a close adviser Roger Stone, one of the most obscene clowns to ever ooze his way into American politics, who was recently banned from appearances on CNN after tweeting racist cracks about some of the networks commentators.\n\n(Stone has claimed in the past that he has shied away from racially inflammatory campaign tactics, which, if you believe that, Ive got a bridge over the East River to sell you.)\n\nAnd those are all just examples from this campaign. There is no need to rehash every incidence of racist swill in Trumps long public career. But this all goes to explain even further the worldview that Trump has developed. He has ensconced himself in a bubble where he can hold court at some five-star Manhattan restaurant, gamely recounting the details of some racially charged crime he read about in that days New York Post, with no sense of what his ranting might sound like to people whose check he isnt picking up. He has surrounded himself with racists and misogynists of every stripe, and didnt throw in at least one or two confidants who could explain to him that he is not running for president exclusively in Alabama in the 1930s.\n\nSo why on earth would he notice if his butler was a raging nutball while the guy was exaggerating the distance Trump was hitting golf balls into the Intracoastal Waterway (an actual anecdote in the Times story)? One can picture them out on the Mar-a-Lago lawn, with Senecal telling him those 225-yard drives are actually 275 and nodding along in agreement when Trump rants about Obama refusing to release his birth certificate.\n\nBecause this is Donald Trump: An entitled, spoiled rich boy who cannot imagine that any of his pronouncements might be cruel or racist, because he has surrounded himself with people who believe the exact same things, and wouldnt dare say otherwise if they didnt because they think their livelihoods depend on keeping their mouths shut.\n\nAnthony Senecal is an 84-year-old man, so presumably he doesnt have too many years of spewing this garbage all over his own Facebook wall left. He should be a one-day story. What is of much more concern is how this incident will be treated by the media. (I eagerly await a flood of Is this Donald Trumps Jeremiah Wright moment hot takes.) It is of much more concern that the Republican Party frontrunner will revert to form and defend Senecal. But it is of the greatest concern that this will simply make no difference to Trumps supporters  ironically, some of whom might well be the same people who have been screaming about Wright since 2008. Why should they care? The butler and his boss arent saying anything they dont already truly believe."

        "content": "The horrific killing of a police bloodhound, who helped find nine people over the course of his sniffer-dog career, has outraged Italians and sparked a criminal investigation to find his killers.\n\nBruno, 7, was found dead Friday morning in his shed in southern Taranto. His trainer, Arcangelo Caressa, said that he had been fed bits of dog food laced with nails. In a social media post Tuesday, Caressa urged police to find the killers before I do.\n\nPremier Giorgia Meloni, who was photographed with Bruno after one of his heroic rescues, said that his slaughter was vile, cowardly, unacceptable.\n\nBruno, 7, was a bloodhound sniffer-dog. Arcangelo Caressa / via Facebook\n\nLawmaker Michael Vittoria Brambilla, a longtime animal rights activist, filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors under a new law that she helped push through stiffening penalties for anyone who kills or mistreats an animal.\n\nThe editor of the Il Giornale daily, Vittorio Feltri, voiced outrage, saying Bruno had done more civic good in Italy than most citizens.\n\nCaressa said that he had told prosecutors that he suspected that he was the ultimate target of Brunos killers, and that Bruno was killed to get to me.\n\nHe cited his efforts at rescuing dogs that were being used for illegal dogfights, saying that he had already received threats for his work. He said he had given police investigators the names of two people who he suspected.\n\nThe new animal protection law, known as the Brambilla law, went into effect on July 1 and calls for up to four years in prison and a 60,000-euro (around a $70,000) fine, with the stiffest penalties applied if the mistreatment is committed in front of children or is filmed and disseminated online.\n\nFeltri said that the penalty should be even greater than four years, saying animals must be respected especially when they behave heroically as Bruno had.\n\nCaressa said that during his career, Bruno had found five people alive during rescues and had located the bodies of four people who had died, but whose bodies were able to be returned to their loved ones."

        "content": "Great news, everyone! We can all stop thinking about Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged with the sex trafficking of minors in 2019 and found dead in his Manhattan jail cell shortly after, apparently of suicide. Great minds have looked into the case and discovered there is nothing more to uncover. So dont waste your time wondering which powerful people might have been part of Epsteins alleged trafficking operation. Theres nothing to see here  nothing at all. Case officially closed.\n\nThat, in essence, was the message from the Trump administration over the weekend. On Sunday, Axios reported on a memo from Trumps justice department and the FBI that concluded there is no evidence that Epstein was involved in blackmailing people, kept a client list or was murdered. Most importantly, the memo said there is no evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\n\nThis is a big deal because Trump and his lackeys have spent a lot of time and energy dangling Epstein-related conspiracy bait in front of their base, constantly insinuating that theyre on the verge of revealing the shocking truth about Epsteins network of elite predators. When asked about an Epstein client list (the one that the new memo says is nonexistent) during a February appearance on Fox News, the US attorney general Pam Bondi said: Its sitting on my desk right now to review. Shortly after that interview there was a big to-do where Epstein-obsessed Maga influencers were invited to the White House and given binders titled the Epstein Files, full of information that Bondi promised will make you sick. Shock horror, there was nothing new or notable in those binders and Maga had a meltdown.\n\nNow, a second Epstein-induced meltdown is in full swing. Elon Musk, who is back to publicly fighting with Trump, and has threatened to start a new political party, has been firing off jabs about the justice departments Epstein U-turn. On Monday, Musk, who previously accused Trump of being in the Epstein Files, retweeted a post by a woman called Sarah Fields that said: If the entire government is protecting paedophiles, it has officially become the government against the people. Bit late figuring out the Trump administration doesnt work for the people  but hey, welcome to the resistance, Elon!\n\nThe conservative activist Robby Starbuck is also fuming. Pam Bondi said the Epstein client list was on her desk to review for release to the public just a few months ago, Starbuck tweeted. Now the DOJ she leads claims that theres no Epstein client list. Sorry but this is unacceptable  We deserve answers.\n\nIts always fun when the Maga crowd realise what the people they propelled into power are really like. But why are rightwing voices the loudest on this topic? Starbuck is right that the current situation is unacceptable: everyone should be demanding more answers about Epstein. Everyone should be outraged that there is only one person, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has actually faced justice in what was, by all accounts, a vast trafficking operation. Some people have paid in other ways  in 2023 Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75m (60m) to settle a lawsuit brought by a group of women who accused it of helping facilitate Epsteins operations  but Maxwell is the only person to have got prison time.\n\nThere are, it should be said, a lot of ridiculous Epstein-related conspiracy theories circulating. Those obviously should not be indulged. But Ill tell you what is not a conspiracy: the fact that there are a lot of high-status people who are very interested in covering up their association with the disgraced financier. It is not a conspiracy to say the US has a two-tier justice system where rich and powerful people can do terrible things and face no consequences.\n\nEarlier this year, Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent Epstein victims, died of suicide. She was the third Epstein accuser who is reported to have died of suicide or a drug overdose. Epstein destroyed countless lives. And he didnt do it alone: he was enabled by respectable people who actively facilitated his crimes. And, more broadly, he was enabled by people who looked the other way, who helped whitewash his reputation, who hobnobbed with him in high society. Those people are still out there, living their best lives. And it is looking increasingly likely they will never be held accountable.\n\nArwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"

Nothing here is modeled, nothing here is stress-tested, everything is a riff, Friedman said last night.

        "content": "The Future of Sports Is Here: We are on a mission to redefine superhumanity through science, innovation and sports.\n\nAn unabashedly ambitious goal, or at least choice of words. Yet redefining superhumanity isnt enough for the Enhanced Games, a start-up that plans to hold an Olympic-style competition next year in Las Vegas.\n\nThe venture also seeks to reinvent sports with science.\n\nTranslation: Not just allow performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), not just encourage their use, but celebrate their use.\n\nOr, in the juice-flecked hyperbole of Enhanced Games copywriters, We are pioneering a new era in athletic competition that embraces scientific advancements to push the boundaries of human performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreaking a world record in track or swimming sprint events will trigger a $1 million payout to the athlete, one of several performance bonuses promised by Enhanced. Where will the money come from? Investors reportedly include conservative billionaire Peter Thiel, Saudi prince Khaled bin Alwaleed Al Saud, and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nFrom the audacity of the message to the deep pockets funding the venture to the athletes tempted by the prospect of making big money and setting world records, the Enhanced Games are worth a closer look.\n\nWhy are the Enhanced Games in the news?\n\nWorld Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president Witold Banka sounded an alarm last week at a meeting of Summer Olympics sports leaders, warning that the Enhanced Games pose a threat to all thats hallowed and decent in global sport.\n\nThis initiative seeks to normalize the use of potentially dangerous drugs, Banka said. For the sake of athlete health and the purity of sport, of course, it must be stopped.\n\nAs the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles approach, we cannot allow what should be a celebration of honest sporting endeavor to be overshadowed by this cynical attempt to undermine clean sport. We will urge the U.S. authorities to find legal ways to block this initiative.\n\nWitold Banka, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), attends a press conference at the 2024 Summer Olympics on July 25, 2024, in Paris. (Michel Euler / Associated Press)\n\nBankas warning prompted eye-rolling in some quarters. The Senate committee on Consumer Protection, Technology and Data Privacy will hold a hearing Tuesday titled WADA Shame: Swimming in Denial Over Chinese Doping.\n\nWADA refused to investigate claims of 23 Chinese swimmers testing positive for a PED before the Tokyo Olympics. With the LA Games in 2028 and Salt Lake City Games in 2034 looming, the Senate committee also plans to address claims that inconsistent enforcement by WADA has resulted in unfair competitions impacting American athletes.\n\nUSADA chief executive Travis Tygart accused Banka of mentioning the Enhanced Games to distract from the upcoming Senate hearing, telling the Associated Press, Bankas indignation equals his misinformation or ignorance about how free democratic societies and markets work.\n\nVoices Lopez: Three years away from the Olympics, L.A. is tripping over hurdles and trying to play catchup As lead host and a partner in the staging of the next years World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games, L.A.s reputation is on the line.\n\nThat doesnt mean Tygart is A-OK with an endeavor that encourages the use of PEDs and the resulting tainted accomplishments.\n\nAs we have repeatedly said, for all of the obvious reasons, the Enhanced Games or any other open competition is a bad idea, Tygart said in comments emailed to Agence France-Presse. If he really wants to ask U.S. authorities to do something, he should show up and ask the Senate to do something.\n\nThe first global sports body to push back is World Aquatics, which passed a rule two weeks ago that bans any swimmer who supports the Enhanced Games  even if theyve never competed  from representing their country again.\n\nFormer Olympic athlete Michael Phelps, (from left) Travis Tygart, CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, and former Olympic athlete Allison Schmitt are sworn in during an Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 25, 2024. (Nathan Howard / Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rule applies to those who support, endorse, or participate in sporting events that embrace the use of scientific advancements or other practices that may include prohibited substances and/or prohibited methods, a World Aquatics statement said.\n\nWhen and where will the Enhanced Games take place?\n\nThe Enhanced Games will take aim at world records in swimming, weightlifting and track at Resorts World in Las Vegas on Memorial Day Weekend, 2026.\n\nScheduled swimming events are the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle, and the 50-meter and 100-meter butterfly. Weightlifting will include the snatch and the clean & jerk. Track events will include the 100-meter dash and the 110-meter hurdles.\n\nChef Ray Garcias restaurant, Viva!, located inside the Resorts World Las Vegas on Thursday, June 24, 2021. (Mariah Tauger/Los Angeles Times)\n\nEach event will carry a prize purse of $500,000, with $250,000 awarded to each winner. In addition, bonuses will be paid for world records, including $1 million for records in the 100-meter sprint and 50-meter freestyle, which the Enhanced Games website describes as the two definitive tests of raw human speed.\n\nThe Enhanced Games will take place within the resort. The competition complex features a four-lane pool, a six-lane sprint track and a weightlifting stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho came up with this and why?\n\nThe founder and president of the Enhanced Games is Aron DSouza, an Australian entrepreneur. DSouza has been on a crusade to create an alternative to the Olympic Games, which he believes dont compensate athletes fairly.\n\nHe advocates for the use of PEDs, arguing that athletes should have the freedom to make choices about their own bodies and that WADA acts as an anti-science police force for the International Olympic Committee.\n\nPreviously, DSouza led Thiels litigation against Gawker Media involving the wrestler Hulk Hogan, which resulted in one of the largest invasion of privacy judgments in history, and is the subject of the book Conspiracy by author Ryan Holiday.\n\nDSouza is the founder of Sargon, a technology infrastructure company in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. He sold his stake in the company in 2018.\n\n(L-R) Amy Chua and Peter Thiel attend Inauguration Eve hosted by Uber, X and The Free Press at Cafe Riggs on January 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Leigh Vogel / Getty Images for Uber, X and The Free Press)\n\nThe extent to which billionaire investors, such as Thiel, Alwaleed Al Saud and Trump Jr., will fund the Enhanced Games is unclear. Money isnt a problem, if statements on the events website are believed: We are backed by some of the worlds most successful venture capitalists, allowing us to operate independently without government and taxpayer funding.\n\nDSouza told the Associated Press that Trump Jr.s group, called 1789 Capital, is bringing double digit millions to the Enhanced Games. Trump Jr. made a video trumpeting his partnership, that includes an appearance by his father, President Trump.\n\nTrump Jr., in a statement accompanying the announcement of the funding, said: This is about excellence, innovation, and American dominance on the world stage  something the MAGA movement is all about.\n\nDSouza is thrilled by the backing of Americas first family and other moneyed interests.\n\nTo know that some of the most significant figures in American social and political life support the Enhanced Games is more important to us than any investment, he said on a video call in February. Ive had the great fortune of working alongside many members of the administration and other prominent figures of the Trump movement over the years, so its a very natural fit.\n\nDSouza and his team express lofty goals beyond juicing athletes, setting records and paying race winners. Last week, DSouza posted as much on LinkedIn:\n\nThis isnt just about enhancement. Its about economic freedom. About athletes having a choice. About breaking the monopoly that old institutions hold over human performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the Enhanced Games, we are unapologetic: Were not backing down. We will fight  in the courts, in the public square, and in the arena of ideas  for every athlete whos been silenced, underpaid, or discarded.\n\nWhy are performance-enhancing drugs forbidden anyway?\n\nThe list of health risks associated with taking anabolic steroids  which have no medical use approved by the U.S. government  is long and frightening:\n\nMen may see their breasts and prostate gland grow and their testicles shrink. Women may get a deeper voice, grow body hair and lose hair on their head. Both men and women might tear tendons or develop liver tumors, severe acne, elevated blood pressure, heart problems, issues with anger and depression.\n\nThe Enhanced Games say the competition will be under the supervision of a medical team, but by the time the games begin, damage from taking PEDs may have already developed.\n\nProtecting athletes is our top priority, the Enhanced Games website proclaims. Every competitor will undergo rigorous, state-of-the-art medical profiling before participating in the competition.\n\nHow has the global sports community reacted?\n\nThe first athlete to show results from using the Enhanced Games PEDs regimen is Kristian Gkolomeev, a Greek swimmer who never medaled in four Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn February, Gkolomeev swam two-hundredths of a second faster than the 50-meter freestyle world record with a time of 20.89. He wore an inline full-body open water suit that is prohibited by World Aquatics.\n\nIm kind of like the driver in the car, but I need the team behind me, Gkolomeev said during an Enhanced Games promotional event last month in Las Vegas.\n\nGreeces Kristian Gkolomeev competes in the Swimming Mens 50m Freestyle Semifinal 1 during the LEN European Aquatics Championships, at the Milan Gale Muskatirovic sports centre in Belgrade, on June 22, 2024. (Andrej Isakovic / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMany believe that breaking records under the influence of PEDs is meaningless.\n\nPaul Ifrim, a Romanian Luger who finished 20th at the 2010 Winter Olympics, responded to DSouzas LinkedIn post with this comment:\n\nI earned my place at the Olympics through hard, clean work and unwavering dedication over the course of many years. Integrity, fair play, respect, and perseverance are what inspire and shape true athletes. Your argument for enhancing drugs, viewed as athlete compensation, is a disgrace to those principles.\n\nWhat message are we sending young, aspiring athletes? That cheating and cutting corners is a valid path to success? These are pathetic excuses for undermining the true spirit of competition. Youre delusional for promoting this agenda. True athletes rise through grit and honor, not shortcuts and hypocrisy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTygart, the CEO of USADA, had a similar reaction: While those behind the Enhanced Games might be looking to make a quick buck, that profit would come at the expense of kids across the world thinking they need to dope to chase their dreams. We desperately wish this investment was being made in the athletes who are currently training and competing the real and safe way.\n\nThey are the role models this world so desperately needs and they are the ones who deserve our support  not some dangerous clown show that puts profit over principle.\n\nA counterpoint was published last summer by anti-doping expert Michael Ashenden, who helped create the athlete blood passport system and develop a test for the blood-boosting drug Erythropoietin (EPO).\n\nInitially opposed to the Enhanced Games, Ashenden changed his mind, writing that the failures of WADA to combat doping in the Olympics make an alternative viable.\n\nToday I advocate for the concept of an Enhanced Games to co-exist with the Olympic Movement, provided their athletes do nothing illegal, Ashenden wrote. I realized that not following the WADA rules was not so radical after all....\n\nI acknowledge that by offering incentives for record performances, the Enhanced Games are tacitly encouraging the use of performance-enhancing substances. But by offering a gold medal, the Olympic Movement also incentivizes the use of performance-enhancing substances....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it may be a bitter pill for the Olympic Movement, it was foreseeable that the commercialization of sport under their stewardship would create an environment that seeded a corporate disruptor."

        "content": "The United States deep involvement in the 12-day-old Israel-Iran war, which may not be over despite a declared ceasefire, has reignited an age-old clash between Congress and the president: Who has the power to launch a U.S. military offensive  if not outright war  against another country?\n\nThe debate became especially charged this past weekend, when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities in support of its ally, Israel, without advance authorization from Congress. At its root lies an inherent conflict within the U.S. Constitution, which empowers only Congress to declare war but makes the president commander in chief of the armed forces.\n\nThe Trump administration briefed top Republican lawmakers and the Senate Democratic leader on Saturday evening before the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities early Sunday morning local time. But it wasnt a request for authorization or a formal declaration of war; it was a heads-up. Meanwhile, top Democrats in Congress said Tuesday that they were still unclear about the presidents bombing decision and strategy.\n\nWhy We Wrote This The Iran strikes raise questions about whether President Donald Trumps actions align with the intent of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, but Republicans mostly stick with the president.\n\nThis Trump is different from Trump 1.0  more ready to use military dominance, more willing to assert his authority by military actions domestically and internationally, says Harold Koh, a Yale Law School professor and former legal adviser to the State Department during the Obama administration.\n\nCongress has to make a serious effort to assert its authority here, or hell just stop bothering to consult, Professor Koh adds.\n\nThe last time Congress made a formal declaration of war was in 1942, during World War II. Under more recent presidents, a legal mechanism called an Authorization for Use of Military Force  a joint resolution by Congress that authorizes the president to use the U.S. armed forces in specific military action  has served as the functional equivalent.\n\nAP/File The chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives was tense and packed as President Franklin Roosevelt told Congress and the nation that Our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger. He then asked for a declaration of war against Japan on Dec. 8, 1941.\n\nIn the run-up to the current U.S.-Iran hostilities, President Donald Trump kept the world guessing over whether he would join Israels effort to neutralize what it saw as an imminent nuclear threat from Iran. The answer became clear only after the American mission was finished, U.S. bombers had left Iranian airspace, and President Trump followed up with a statement on his social media site.\n\nA cloak of secrecy may have been necessary to pull off the attack. But with the prospect of continuing war, including potentially more Iranian retaliatory strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East, debate is raging over Congress role as a coequal branch of government.\n\nViews on the Constitution, split by party\n\nAt a time of intense political polarization, most members of Congress fall along party lines. One outlier, Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, responded bluntly on the social platform X to Mr. Trumps announcement Saturday night of a very successful attack on three Iranian sites: This is not Constitutional, he wrote.\n\nOn the flip side, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson stated Tuesday that the strikes on Irans nuclear facilities were clearly within President Trumps Article II powers in the U.S. Constitution as commander in chief. Therefore, the speaker added, it is the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the president to win congressional consent before committing U.S. forces to combat, that is unconstitutional.\n\nSome Democrats are equally adamant that the legislative branch is the only branch authorized to commit U.S. forces to combat.\n\nThe Constitution is clear. Only Congress has the power to declare war, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told the Monitor. The president of the United States does not have authority under the Constitution to attack another nation, absent an emergency and a need to protect American troops, American citizens, or the homeland.\n\nStill, the Democrats are not moving in lockstep, with some expressing frustration that more have not signed on to resolutions drawn up in the Senate by Democrat Tim Kaine of Virginia and in the House by Representative Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California.\n\nFrancis Chung/Politico/AP Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is seen in his Capitol Hill office as he takes part in a podcast interview with political commentator Glenn Beck, May 20, 2025.\n\nThe Massie-Khanna measure would block further U.S. military involvement in the war, but on Monday, Mr. Massie said he would withdraw the resolution if there was a ceasefire.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Jim Himes, Gregory Meeks, and Adam Smith introduced a separate resolution Monday to cease hostilities in Iran absent congressional authorization. Representative Meeks told the Monitor that the new resolution closes a loophole in the Massie-Khanna resolution that, he says, would have prevented the U.S. from defending allies if they were attacked.\n\nIn addition, a handful of progressive House Democrats  including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York  called for Mr. Trumps impeachment over the bombing of Iran, but House leadership has sidestepped the suggestion.\n\nAfter both Israel and Iran announced a ceasefire, they continued to attack each others territory.\n\nMr. Trump, speaking to reporters early Tuesday as he left the White House for a NATO summit in The Hague, used profanity  rare for a president to do publicly  when he expressed his frustration about the war.\n\nThey dont know what the [redacted] theyre doing, said the president, who had campaigned last year on ending forever wars.\n\nAwaiting news of Irans nuclear program\n\nAlso delaying action on Capitol Hill was the postponement of classified briefings on the war for members of both houses of Congress by administration officials. One key question is the state of Irans nuclear program after the U.S. bombing. The Senate briefing has been rescheduled for Thursday, while the timing of the House briefing remains unclear.\n\nSenator Kaine, who sponsored a War Powers Resolution to bar Mr. Trump from taking further military action in Iran without congressional approval, said Monday that he expected the briefing would be an important factor in some members decisions.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, speaking to the Monitor, says that Congress slowness to act argues in favor of leaving war decisions to the president.\n\nI think the Founding Fathers laid this out correctly, Senator Rounds says. We have a commander in chief. You cannot have Congress today holding up what would be a very important item of protecting our national interests based upon the debate speed at which Congress moves.\n\nWe can debate it afterwards, he adds.\n\nStill, lining up congressional support in advance of military action can strengthen a presidents hand, says Curtis Bradley, a law professor at the University of Chicago and an expert on foreign relations law.\n\nDeepen your worldview\n\nwith Monitor Highlights.

        "content": "CNN \n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration amended the terms of its emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines on Tuesday, allowing people ages 65 and older and certain people with weakened immunity to get additional doses before this falls vaccination campaigns.\n\nThe bivalent vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna carry instructions for fighting both the original strain of the Covid-19 virus as well as Omicron and its spinoffs.\n\nThey have been available in the United States since September under emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, which tightly restrict how the vaccines may be given.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FDA changed the terms of the authorizations for those vaccines so that certain individuals could get an additional dose ahead of most others.\n\nNamely, adults ages 65 and older who have received a single dose of a bivalent vaccine may receive an additional dose at least four months following their first dose.\n\nMost individuals with certain degrees of immunocompromise who have received a first dose of a bivalent vaccine can get a second at least 2 months later. Additional doses may be administered at the discretion of their healthcare provider.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Childrens Hospital, has been calling on the FDA to increase access to the bivalent boosters for those who want them. He says for the most part, todays guidance from the agency makes sense.\n\nMy only question is why the 65 year age cutoff? What was that based on? Ordinarily I would have preferred that it be brought down to 60 or even 50, Hotez said in an email to CNN.\n\nFor those Americans who understand its importance, we should make second bivalent boosters available. Finally, well soon need guidance about another annual fall booster. Presumably that information comes sometime this summer, he added.\n\nFor immunocompromised children ages 6 months through 4 years, eligibility for additional bivalent doses will depend on the vaccine previously received, the FDA said in a news release.\n\nAnother big change is that most unvaccinated individuals may now receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine, rather than mutiple doses of the original single-strain vaccines, the agency said. The FDA simplified its recommendation for unvaccinated individuals after recognizing that most Americans now have some immunity against Covid-19, even if its just through past infections.\n\nEvidence is now available that most of the U.S. population 5 years of age and older has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, either from vaccination or infection that can serve as a foundation for the protection provided by the bivalent vaccines. COVID-19 continues to be a very real risk for many people, and we encourage individuals to consider staying current with vaccination, including with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. The available data continue to demonstrate that vaccines prevent the most serious outcomes of COVID-19, which are severe illness, hospitalization, and death, said Dr. Peter Marks, head of FDAs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a news release.\n\nChildren ages 6 months through 5 years who have not yet been vaccinated may now receive a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine as their primary series, or a three-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine if they are 6 months through 4 years of age. Children who are age 5 may receive two doses of the Moderna bivalent or a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine.\n\nChildren ages 6 months through 5 years who got started on their monovalent vaccines, can now get a dose of a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses they qualify for will depend on the number of doses theyve already had and what kind of vaccine they got.\n\nThe agency stressed that most people who have gotten one dose of a bivalent vaccine are not currently eligible for a second dose.\n\nAnd they encouraged everyone who hasnt yet gotten their first dose of a bivalent vaccine to do so, and many Americans are still in that bucket.\n\nOnly about 17% of those eligible, less than 1 in 5 Americans, has gotten a recommended dose.\n\nAs time has passed, adults with reduced immune function because of their age or an underlying health problem have been asking doctors whether they need another dose of the bivalent vaccines.\n\nThe United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane.\n\nBut the agency has not been free to make whats known as a permissive use recommendation about the boosters, which would allow doctors to offer additional doses to vulnerable patients because of the terms of the EUA.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe updated terms give the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) greater freedom to recommend additional doses of the bivalent vaccines. The ACIP is holding a meeting on the Covid-19 vaccines Wednesday and is expected to endorse the FDAs changes.\n\nFor everyone not covered by todays changes, the FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.\n\nBoth Canada and the United Kingdom have offered another round of bivalent boosters to those at highest risk from Covid-19 this spring."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Last week, as much of the world focussed on Iran and Israel, the crypto lobby was celebrating a huge victory in Washington. History is being made, Jeremy Allaire, the founder and chief executive of Circle, a stablecoin platform, wrote on X, shortly after the Senate voted through the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to facilitate the growth of the digital currency, and to give it, and other crypto assets, the stamp of legitimacy.\n\nStablecoins, which are designed to retain a constant value of one dollar, making them much less volatile than regular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, currently exist in a regulatory gray area, in which regulators have treated some, but not all, of them as securities subject to the securities laws. Although companies such as Tether and Circle created stablecoins that now have a combined market cap of more than two hundred and fifty billion dollars worldwide, major banks and other traditional financial institutions largely stayed away from them, put off by regulatory uncertainty and cryptos association with illicit transactions. The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act) may well change all this and bring crypto into the mainstream financial system. It treats stablecoins as a means of payment rather than as securities, and it creates a set of rules for their issuer to follow, under the oversight of state and federal regulators.\n\nThe bill passed with support from fifty Republicans and eighteen Democrats. Allaire said that the final passage of the act, which still has to go through the House of Representatives, will drive US economic and national competitiveness for decades to come. The Republican senator Bill Hagerty, of Tennessee, who sponsored the bill, made similarly expansive claims. But to many public-interest groups, and to Senate Democrats who voted against the legislation, its progress through the Senate mainly illustrated the power of the crypto lobby, which now exercises enormous influence at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. The GENIUS Act is an important step, but it is just one of many actions that the crypto industry and its allies in the White House and Capitol Hill are taking to launch an uncontrolled experiment in unleashing crypto on the economy and the financial system, Mark Hays, an associate director of crypto and fintech at Americans for Financial Reform, a Washington-based advocacy group, told me.\n\nDuring the Biden Administration, a number of crypto exchanges failed, and the creator of one of them, Sam Bankman-Fried, was convicted of eight counts of fraud and conspiracy. (He had illegally transferred customers deposits to his hedge fund.) Over at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, the Biden-appointed chair, said at the time that the crypto industry was rife with fraud and manipulation, and his agency sued some of its most prominent firms, including Coinbase, the United States top crypto exchange, claiming that they were violating securities laws. Last year, a survey from the Pew Research Center found that more than sixty per cent of Americans had little or no faith in the safety of crypto as an investment.\n\nBut, also in 2024, three super PACs financed by the crypto industry spent an estimated two hundred and sixty-five million dollars to elect pro-crypto candidates and defeat crypto skeptics, such as Sherrod Brown, the senior Democratic senator from Ohio. With last weeks vote, the crypto lobby recouped some of its huge investment, Bartlett Naylor, a financial-policy analyst at the consumer-advocacy group Public Citizen, told me. The crypto sectors financial contributions converted some elected politicians to a pro-crypto stance, and it scared the bejeezus out of a lot of others, he added.\n\nDefenders of the GENIUS Act say that it will protect holders of stablecoins by requiring their issuers to adhere to a set of codified rules, which include keeping the holders money in safe reserve assets, such as Treasury bills and bank accounts; publishing the composition of these reserves on a monthly basis; and, in the case of issuers with a market capitalization of more than fifty billion dollars, publishing audited financial statements annually. The bill also stipulates that stablecoin issuers must observe some money-laundering laws, and that, if they enter bankruptcy, the holders of their stablecoins will have first claim on their assets. The Genius bill will ensure stablecoin reserves will be safe and boring, and that consumers will have a direct legal claim on the underlying assets, Christian Catalini, a research scientist at M.I.T.s Sloan School of Management, who set up the universitys Cryptoeconomics Lab, wrote to me in an e-mail.\n\nCritics of the bill say that its protections dont go nearly far enough. Its a collection of half measures that will create a regulatory imprimatur for stablecoins without removing the dangers associated with them, Hays said. We see in this bill a failure to learn from the regulatory mistakes of the past. He compared it to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which ostensibly set up a new regulatory framework for derivatives but actually weakened oversight in key areasa failure that became patent during the global financial crisis of 2007-09. Weve seen this show before, Hays added.\n\nThe Senate legislation contains a conflict-of-interest provision that would prohibit any member of Congress or senior executive branch official from issuing a payment stablecoin product during their time in public service. However, legal experts say this restriction, like other ethics laws, wouldnt apply to the President or Vice-President, an exemption that is far from trivial. In March, World Liberty Financial, a crypto startup that is majority-owned by the Trump family, announced that it was issuing a new stablecoin, USD1. Since the Trump family is now a player in stablecoins, it potentially stands to benefit greatly from an expansion in their use. (The market cap of USD1 already stands at about $2.2 billion.) If this bill passes the full Congress, it is certainly possible that Trumps stablecoin could become one of the dominant parts of the crypto ecosystem, which would be extremely rewarding to him, Hays said.\n\nThe Trump familys efforts to enrich itself by issuing a $Trump meme coin have already received a great deal of attention. (Earlier this month, the Forbes reporter Dan Alexander estimated that Trumps meme-coin haul could be worth more than three hundred million dollars.) Critics say that the existence of a Trump-owned stablecoin creates new possibilities for interested parties to funnel money to him and his companies. Early last month, one of World Liberty Financials co-founders said that its new stablecoin would be used in a two-billion-dollar investment that an entity tied to the government of the United Arab Emirates was making in Binance, the worlds top crypto exchange. The companys founder, the Chinese billionaire Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced in the U.S. to four months in prison last April, after pleading guilty to money-laundering violations, and he is now reportedly seeking a Presidential pardon. At the end of May this year, the S.E.C. announced that it was dismissing a civil suit against Binance."

        "content": "Paul Horner, the 38-year-old satire writer was found dead last week after a short, comet-like career of producing fake news, some of which may have very well influenced President Donald Trumps 2016 electoral victory. Local authorities  who discovered him in his bed  suspect a drug overdose as cause of death, surmising no foul play, CBS News reports.\n\nHe  or someone using his fake byline of Jimmy Rustling  was still publishing to abcnews.com.co as recently as September 15.\n\nHorner was many things, but apologetic was not one of them. He famously told the Washington Post last year that Donald Trump was elected because of him and his widely shared and fabricated articles.\n\nThroughout his work, he bolstered conservative conspiracy theories including the notion that anti-Trump protestors were paid to attend the candidates rallies and that Barack Obama was secretly a radical Muslim. Facebook was his platform of dissemination, but Horners articles were shared  and sometimes even used as primary sources  by Fox News, Donald Trump Jr., and Trumps campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nHorner, and many others saw Trumps rise as a change in Americas DNA, a total disregard for fact. People are definitely dumber, Horner told the Post in November, 2016. My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. He said with observable enthusiam, They never fact-check anything!\n\nSomewhat the trollish sociopath, and genuinely a political danger, Horner framed himself as an undercover operative of the alt-right, effectively, rewriting their lies on websites that looked like or even straight-up stole the images of reliable news sources. But when caught, Horner would shrug, call it satire, claim he was really exposing the dishonesty of the conservative right, and repeat, pulling in thousands in profit. All the while, the traditional media relabeled his toxicity as edginess, his work representative of a new media paradigm, one that social media helped to usher in.\n\nBut, as Salons Matthew Sheffield writes: Its important to realize, however, that the massive number of conspiracy-peddling, far-right websites that have proliferated in recent years belong to a long tradition of conservative fake news. It wasnt that Horner and his ilk were rebels or something new. Just like Trumps attacks on mainstream media, that clique honed in on a deep-seated and long-settled distrust of news sources. They hadnt birthed something not seen before.\n\nIndeed, Kurt Andersen has authored an entire book documenting the fake-news era, which he argued was 500 years in the making. The truth is, the sort of mindset Horner represented was even older than that.\n\nWhether youre a Breitbart-like founder or, like Horner, a Breitbart-audience exploiter, theres money to be made in the business of fake news. Horner himself told the Post he raked in about $10,000 a month producing the kind of journalism that right-wingers wanted to see and believe in regardless of actual facts (its the way Fox News has made billions).\n\nJust like any death, especially one by a clearly troubled man battling addiction, it is a tragedy. But Horners life and work does not provide us a window into the transformation of modern media or make him pioneer in alternative journalism. No, theres no great insight to be gained from the man who said openly in the same interview that he hated Trump and yet seemed proud of his role in the candidates victory.\n\nHorners fake news career was about two things: attention and money. His journey just shows the sacrifices in humanity and decency some will make to get them."

        "content": "On a blustery spring Thursday, just after midterms, I went out for noodles with Alex and Eugene, two undergraduates at New York University, to talk about how they use artificial intelligence in their schoolwork. When I first met Alex, last year, he was interested in a career in the arts, and he devoted a lot of his free time to photo shoots with his friends. But he had recently decided on a more practical path: he wanted to become a C.P.A. His Thursdays were busy, and he had forty-five minutes until a study session for an accounting class. He stowed his skateboard under a bench in the restaurant and shook his laptop out of his bag, connecting to the internet before we sat down.\n\nAlex has wavy hair and speaks with the chill, singsong cadence of someone who has spent a lot of time in the Bay Area. He and Eugene scanned the menu, and Alex said that they should get clear broth, rather than spicy, so we can both lock in our skin care. Weeks earlier, when Id messaged Alex, he had said that everyone he knew used ChatGPT in some fashion, but that he used it only for organizing his notes. In person, he admitted that this wasnt remotely accurate. Any type of writing in life, I use A.I., he said. He relied on Claude for research, DeepSeek for reasoning and explanation, and Gemini for image generation. ChatGPT served more general needs. I need A.I. to text girls, he joked, imagining an A.I.-enhanced version of Hinge. I asked if he had used A.I. when setting up our meeting. He laughed, and then replied, Honestly, yeah. Im not tryin to type all that. Could you tell?\n\nOpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. Six days later, Sam Altman, the C.E.O., announced that it had reached a million users. Large language models like ChatGPT dont think in the human sensewhen you ask ChatGPT a question, it draws from the data sets it has been trained on and builds an answer based on predictable word patterns. Companies had experimented with A.I.-driven chatbots for years, but most sputtered upon release; Microsofts 2016 experiment with a bot named Tay was shut down after sixteen hours because it began spouting racist rhetoric and denying the Holocaust. But ChatGPT seemed different. It could hold a conversation and break complex ideas down into easy-to-follow steps. Within a month, Googles management, fearful that A.I. would have an impact on its search-engine business, declared a code red.\n\nAmong educators, an even greater panic arose. It was too deep into the school term to implement a coherent policy for what seemed like a homework killer: in seconds, ChatGPT could collect and summarize research and draft a full essay. Many large campuses tried to regulate ChatGPT and its eventual competitors, mostly in vain. I asked Alex to show me an example of an A.I.-produced paper. Eugene wanted to see it, too. He used a different A.I. app to help with computations for his business classes, but he had never gotten the hang of using it for writing. I got you, Alex told him. (All the students I spoke with are identified by pseudonyms.)\n\nHe opened Claude on his laptop. I noticed a chat that mentioned abolition. We had to read Robert Wedderburn for a class, he explained, referring to the nineteenth-century Jamaican abolitionist. But, obviously, I wasnt tryin to read that. He had prompted Claude for a summary, but it was too long for him to read in the ten minutes he had before class started. He told me, I said, Turn it into concise bullet points.  He then transcribed Claudes points in his notebook, since his professor ran a screen-free classroom.\n\nAlex searched until he found a paper for an art-history class, about a museum exhibition. He had gone to the show, taken photographs of the images and the accompanying wall text, and then uploaded them to Claude, asking it to generate a paper according to the professors instructions. Im trying to do the least work possible, because this is a class Im not hella fucking with, he said. After skimming the essay, he felt that the A.I. hadnt sufficiently addressed the professors questions, so he refined the prompt and told it to try again. In the end, Alexs submission received the equivalent of an A-minus. He said that he had a basic grasp of the papers argument, but that if the professor had asked him for specifics hed have been so fucked. I read the paper over Alexs shoulder; it was a solid imitation of how an undergraduate might describe a set of images. If this had been 2007, I wouldnt have made much of its generic tone, or of the precise, box-ticking quality of its critical observations.\n\nEugene, serious and somewhat solemn, had been listening with bemusement. I would not cut and paste like he did, because Im a lot more paranoid, he said. Hes a couple of years younger than Alex and was in high school when ChatGPT was released. At the time, he experimented with A.I. for essays but noticed that it made easily noticed errors. This passed the A.I. detector? he asked Alex.\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched, instructors adopted various measures to insure that students work was their own. These included requiring them to share time-stamped version histories of their Google documents, and designing written assignments that had to be completed in person, over multiple sessions. But most detective work occurs after submission. Services like GPTZero, Copyleaks, and Originality.ai analyze the structure and syntax of a piece of writing and assess the likelihood that it was produced by a machine. Alex said that his art-history professor was hella old, and therefore probably didnt know about such programs. We fed the paper into a few different A.I.-detection websites. One said there was a twenty-eight-per-cent chance that the paper was A.I.-generated; another put the odds at sixty-one per cent. Thats better than I expected, Eugene said.\n\nI asked if he thought what his friend had done was cheating, and Alex interrupted: Of course. Are you fucking kidding me?\n\nTheres still one juror who hasnt been properly intimidated. Cartoon by Frank Cotham Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nAs we looked at Alexs laptop, I noticed that he had recently asked ChatGPT whether it was O.K. to go running in Nike Dunks. He had concluded that ChatGPT made for the best confidant. He consulted it as one might a therapist, asking for tips on dating and on how to stay motivated during dark times. His ChatGPT sidebar was an index of the highs and lows of being a young person. He admitted to me and Eugene that hed used ChatGPT to draft his application to N.Y.U.our lunch might never have happened had it not been for A.I. I guess its really dishonest, but, fuck it, Im here, he said.\n\nIts cheating, but I dont think its, like, cheating, Eugene said. He saw Alexs art-history essay as a victimless crime. He was just fulfilling requirements, not training to become a literary scholar.\n\nAlex had to rush off to his study session. I told Eugene that our conversation had made me wonder about my function as a professor. He asked if I taught English, and I nodded.\n\nMm, O.K., he said, and laughed. So youre, like, majorly affected.\n\nI teach at a small liberal-arts college, and I often joke that a student is more likely to hand in a big paper a year late (as recently happened) than to take a dishonorable shortcut. My classes are small and intimate, driven by processes and pedagogical modes, like letting awkward silences linger, that are difficult to scale. As a result, I have always had a vague sense that my students are learning something, even when it is hard to quantify. In the past, if I was worried that a paper had been plagiarized, I would enter a few phrases from it into a search engine and call it due diligence. But I recently began noticing that some students writing seemed out of synch with how they expressed themselves in the classroom. One essay felt stitched together from two mindshalf of it was polished and rote, the other intimate and unfiltered. Having never articulated a policy for A.I., I took the easy way out. The student had had enough shame to write half of the essay, and I focussed my feedback on improving that part.\n\nIts easy to get hung up on stories of academic dishonesty. Late last year, in a survey of college and university leaders, fifty-nine per cent reported an increase in cheating, a figure that feels conservative when you talk to students. A.I. has returned us to the question of what the point of higher education is. Until were eighteen, we go to school because we have to, studying the Second World War and reducing fractions while undergoing a process of socialization. Were essentially learning how to follow rules. College, however, is a choice, and it has always involved the tacit agreement that students will fulfill a set of tasks, sometimes pertaining to subjects they find pointless or impractical, and then receive some kind of credential. But even for the most mercenary of students, the pursuit of a grade or a diploma has come with an ancillary benefit. Youre being taught how to do something difficult, and maybe, along the way, you come to appreciate the process of learning. But the arrival of A.I. means that you can now bypass the process, and the difficulty, altogether.\n\nThere are no reliable figures for how many American students use A.I., just stories about how everyone is doing it. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey of students between the ages of thirteen and seventeen suggests that a quarter of teens currently use ChatGPT for schoolwork, double the figure from 2023. OpenAI recently released a report claiming that one in three college students uses its products. Theres good reason to believe that these are low estimates. If you grew up Googling everything or using Grammarly to give your prose a professional gloss, it isnt far-fetched to regard A.I. as just another productivity tool. I see it as no different from Google, Eugene said. I use it for the same kind of purpose.\n\nBeing a student is about testing boundaries and staying one step ahead of the rules. While administrators and educators have been debating new definitions for cheating and discussing the mechanics of surveillance, students have been embracing the possibilities of A.I. A few months after the release of ChatGPT, a Harvard undergraduate got approval to conduct an experiment in which it wrote papers that had been assigned in seven courses. The A.I. skated by with a 3.57 G.P.A., a little below the schools average. Upstart companies introduced products that specialized in humanizing A.I.-generated writing, and TikTok influencers began coaching their audiences on how to avoid detection.\n\nUnable to keep pace, academic administrations largely stopped trying to control students use of artificial intelligence and adopted an attitude of hopeful resignation, encouraging teachers to explore the practical, pedagogical applications of A.I. In certain fields, this wasnt a huge stretch. Studies show that A.I. is particularly effective in helping non-native speakers acclimate to college-level writing in English. In some STEM classes, using generative A.I. as a tool is acceptable. Alex and Eugene told me that their accounting professor encouraged them to take advantage of free offers on new A.I. products available only to undergraduates, as companies competed for student loyalty throughout the spring. In May, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Edu, a product specifically marketed for educational use, after schools including Oxford University, Arizona State University, and the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School of Business experimented with incorporating A.I. into their curricula. This month, the company detailed plans to integrate ChatGPT into every dimension of campus life, with students receiving personalized A.I. accounts to accompany them throughout their years in college."

        "content": "The US Environmental Protection Agency is launching a new program to adopt some of its 20,000 lab animals in the wake of Trump administration plans to dramatically cut the regulators research arm.\n\nThe Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) non-profit obtained and revealed an EPA document announcing the adoption program. The document announced adoptions for zebrafish and rats from an EPA lab in North Carolina.\n\nIt states: Adopt love. Save a life. Our adoption program has been approved. Would you like to adopt?\n\nThe move is part of the fallout from broad EPA cuts targeting toxicological and other basic research work that is largely being done by the agencys office of research and development.\n\nThe office is being replaced with a much smaller office of applied science and environmental solutions, which, Peer wrote in a statement, is focused on shorter-term projects limited to statutorily required functions instead of long-term research.\n\nThe move is an ill-advised scientific self-lobotomy, said Kyla Bennett, science policy director with Peer and a former EPA attorney.\n\nInstead of developing a strategic plan for meeting its scientific needs, Trumps EPA has decided to largely abandon scientific research except when it is specifically mandated by law, thus embracing some short-term savings to its long-term detriment, Bennett said.\n\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration is aiming to eliminate at least 1,000 EPA scientists, or approximately three-quarters of the office of research and developments staff. The plan, however, is on hold as a legal battle plays out.\n\nThe agency uses rabbits, mice, rats and other animals primarily to test the safety of chemicals and other environmental pollutants.\n\nDuring Trumps first term, the EPA announced a plan to reduce animal testing by 30% by 2025 and end it altogether by 2035. The Biden EPA nixed those plans, and the agency now says it will not be bound by time limits, and is following the best available science, Bennett said.\n\nResearchers use zebrafish to test for toxic effects of some chemicals and pollutants because of the many similarities between the metabolism and physiological structures of zebrafish and humans, and the nervous system structure, blood-brain barrier function, and social behavior of zebrafish, according to a peer-reviewed study.\n\nRecent research looking into the toxic effects of common plastic chemicals and how they may disrupt humans circadian rhythm used zebrafish in the research.\n\nThe reduction in animal testing will make EPA even more dependent on research from chemical companies, which is often framed to mask, rather than identify, potential health and environmental risks, Bennett said.\n\nShe added that eliminating animal research would make it more difficult for the agency to evaluate the toxicological effect of complex chemicals with several thousand variations, like Pfas. It would also kill research that relies on lab animals to understand the long-term effects of pollutants, such as particulate matter.\n\nThe EPA is abandoning its status as a premier scientific organization, Bennett said."

        "content": "Editors Note: This is an updated version of a story that originally ran on April 14, 2023.\n\nNew York CNN \n\nIts April 18, the official deadline to file your federal and state income tax returns for 2022. (It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.)\n\nWhether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic.\n\nThis is the first tax season since 2019 where the IRS and the nation were on normal footing, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a call with reporters.\n\nFor instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And the wait times on those phone calls dropped to just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.\n\nThe agency also added a roster of new online tools for filers, he added.\n\nStill havent filed?\n\nThose online tools may be especially helpful today if you are scrambling to get your return in before midnight. Or, if youve come to the realization that you need to file for an extension. Either way, here are some key things to know:\n\nNot everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there  or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area  its likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\n\nThanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California  which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers  have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.\n\nIf youre in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.\n\nLastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it wont cost you to submit a return.\n\nYour paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But thats not necessarily so.\n\nOther potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:\n\nInterest on your savings\n\nInvestment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)\n\nPay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle\n\nUnemployment income\n\nSocial Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account\n\nTips\n\nGambling winnings\n\nIncome from a rental property you own\n\nOrganize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).\n\nIf you dont recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts  a document may have been sent to you electronically.\n\nHere are some of the tax forms you may have received:\n\nW-2 from your wage or salaried jobs\n\nfrom your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments\n\nfor capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments\n\nfrom your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution\n\nfor interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor\n\nfrom your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didnt get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.\n\nfor payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didnt get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract\n\nfor distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.\n\nBe aware that theres no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning youre responsible for reporting it on your own, according to the Illinois CPA Society.\n\nOne very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If youre eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and havent done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if youre 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.\n\nProofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether youre using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.\n\nLittle mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if youre owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\n\nWhat to do if you cant file by April 18: If youre not able to file on time, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\n\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but havent paid by April 18.\n\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax  perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasnt withheld or you had a big capital gain last year  approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today.\n\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\n\nOr the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file, the agency notes in its instructions.\n\nIf you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select extension and then tax year 2022 when given the option.\n\nYou can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but dont pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\n\nIf you cant pay what you owe in full, the IRS does have some payment plan options. But it might be smart to first consult with a certified public accountant or a tax preparer who is an enrolled agent to make sure you are making the best choice for your circumstance.\n\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your states revenue department, Martin said.\n\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an interactive tax assistant that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.\n\nAlready filed?\n\nIf youve already filed your return, youre probably glad to have it in the rear view mirror. But you may still have a few questions about whats ahead.\n\nWhat about my refund? If you are due a refund, the IRS typically sends it within 21 days of receiving your return. When yours does arrive, it may be smaller than last year, even if your financial life didnt change much. Thats because a number of Covid-related tax breaks expired.\n\nSo far, the average refund paid was $2,878 for the week ending April 7, down from $3,175 at the same point in last years filing season.\n\nWill I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary  and many audits result in no change, meaning you dont end up owing anything more to the IRS. But one thing is common for the vast majority of US tax filers: Audit rates are exceedingly low.\n\nFor filers reporting incomes between $50,000 and $200,000, only 0.1% of them were audited in 2020, according to the latest data from the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million.\n\nLooking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals  defined as making $400,000 or more. As for filers with income below that level, he said he did not anticipate any change in the likelihood they would be audited."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "On April 18th, 2012, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse delivered the first in what was to become one of theif not thelongest-running series of speeches in congressional history. This was toward the end of Barack Obamas first term, and Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, thought that the President wasnt doing enough, or really much of anything, to fight climate change. There were years at a time when the Obama Administration wouldnt use the word climate and change in the same paragraph, Whitehouse recalled recently, in a Zoom interview from his office. And so I made the decisionrather than get jostled around by whatever the current events of the week were, every damn week I was going to do a speech on climate. He had a poster made up showing the Earth as seen from space. Next to the planet, the poster said TIME TO WAKE UP in boxy white letters.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nWhitehouse continued to deliver his (more or less) weekly Time to Wake Up speeches through Obamas second term and Donald Trumps first. Hed prop his increasingly battered sign on an easel and, addressing a mostly empty Senate floor, talk about the latest developments in climate science, the latest climate-related disasters, and Congresss continuing inaction. Congress is still doing nothing, he noted in his two-hundred-and-second speech, delivered in April, 2018.\n\nWhen Joe Biden took office, in January, 2021, Whitehouse gave up his weekly speeches. Biden was making a lot of positive noises about taking climate stuff seriously, Whitehouse said, explaining the move. But he suspected it might be temporary. When the Smithsonian called to ask him to donate his poster to its collection, he demurred: I said, Thank you, but I just may need it again, so Im going to hang on to it.  In February, 2022, he pulled his sign out of storage. Sure enough, the Biden Administration was pretty spongy, he said. And so I went back to the speeches again, not weekly but regularly, to try to jostle them along into a better stance. In the summer of 2022, Congress passedand Biden signedthe first major piece of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, the Inflation Reduction Act (I.R.A.), which authorized hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tax credits and grants to promote clean-energy development. Nevertheless, Whitehouse continued to occasionally trot out his sign in 2023 and 2024.\n\nOn July 9th, Whitehouse is scheduled to give his three-hundredth Time to Wake Up speech. Depending on how you look at things, the timing couldnt be better or it couldnt be worse.\n\nTrump 2.0 has treated climate action with the administrative equivalent of a bunker-buster bomb. The White House has tried to obliterate not just the federal programs aimed at reducing emissions but state and corporate efforts as well. It has demolished many government programs that support climate science and has shuttered many climate-related websites, including the one devoted to National Climate Assessment reports, the next edition of which, due in 2027, it has tried to cancel.\n\nMeanwhile, the Administration has been showering the fossil-fuel industry with love. This started the day of Trumps second Inauguration, when he issued an executive order declaring an energy emergency and pointedly left wind and solar off the list of energy resources. Just about every week since has brought a new billet-doux to the industry: the huge tax-and-spending bill Trump signed last week is, as Mark Gongloff, a Bloomberg Opinion editor, put it, larded with new tax breaks for fossil-fuel producers, including an expanded tax break for using captured carbon dioxide to pump more oil. Its hard to imagine a less-deserving recipient of taxpayer largesse, Gongloff wrote.\n\nBetween the Administrations executive actions and the provisions of the tax bill, a catalogue of all the climate-busting moves of the past six months would run to hundreds of entries. (Climate Backtracker, a website run by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, currently lists a hundred and ninety-six steps that the Trump Administration has taken to scale back or wholly eliminate federal climate mitigation and adaptation measures.) Some of the most consequential climate backtracking moves Republicans have made since January include:\n\nCancelling fees for methane leaks\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gasin the short to medium term, many times more powerful than carbon dioxideand under the I.R.A., oil and gas companies that failed to curb methane leaks were going to have to start paying a per-ton fee. In February, Congress voted to eliminate the rules that the Biden Administration had drawn up for administering the fees, and, under the bill Trump signed last week, the start date for the charge was put off for a decade, meaning that the methane-reduction effort seems dead for the foreseeable future.\n\nEliminating the I.R.A. tax credits for clean energy\n\nAmong the many tax credits that Congress recently voted to repeal or phase out are credits for wind- and solar-energy production, for clean-energy investment, for purchasing electric vehicles, and for making home energy-efficiency improvements. Researchers at Princeton University have calculated that the bill will increase the U.S.s emissions by almost two hundred million metric tons per year by 2030. And researchers at the Rhodium Group have estimated that, in the same time frame, the bill could raise energy costs for households by almost two hundred dollars a year. This bill will strand thousands of energy projects under development, jeopardize billions of dollars in private investment, and kill hundreds of thousands of good-paying American jobs, the Coalition for Community Solar Access said, in a statement, the day the Senate passed its version of the legislation.\n\nRevoking Californias waivers\n\nUnder a provision of the Clean Air Act, California has the power to set vehicle-emission standards that are stricter than federal regulations. Exercising this power, the state had decided that all new cars sold there after 2035 would have to be at least partly electric-powered, and many other states had announced plans to follow Californias lead. But, in May, Congress voted to overrule the so-called California waiver. Its unclear whether the move was legalCalifornia and ten other states have sued to block the overrulebut the turmoil, on top of the repeal of the federal electric-vehicle tax credit, seems likely to significantly slow E.V. sales.\n\nAll this is happening, of course, as global temperatures continue to rise. Last year was the hottest year on record. Global temperatures for the first three months of this year were very nearly as high as last years, even though, in the meantime, the world had entered a so-called La Nia phase, which typically brings cooler weather. In late March, Arctic sea ice reached a record-low extent for the end of the winter, and, in February, Antarctic sea ice reached a near-record-low minimum for any time of year. According to a recent study in the journal Earth System Science Data, warming is accelerating: between 2015 and 2024, the planet heated up at a rate of .27 degrees Celsiushalf a degree Fahrenheita rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record.\n\nThe other day, Whitehouse was still working on the details of his three-hundredth speech. Offering a summary, he said, Weve now entered the era of consequences of our climate negligence. The stuff that the scientists predicted is actually starting to happen, and now that its so real and immediate, we should consider how it is that we failed so badly.\n\nAsked how effective any wake-up call thats been repeated three hundred times could be, he replied, I think that the work that Ive done has made a real, if incremental, difference. The problem is that its up against the massive apparatus of corrupt influence that the fossil-fuel industry runs, and that now controls the Republican Party. And its really hard for any one person, even a U.S. Senator, to succeed at disabling that. "

        "content": "Sean Combs found guilty on 2 counts, but acquitted on most serious charges\n\nSean Combs was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, but on the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking the jury found him not guilty.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nHip-hop mogul Sean Combs received a mixed verdict in his federal criminal trial in Manhattan yesterday.\n\nA MARTNEZ, HOST:\n\nHe was found not guilty of two of the most serious charges, racketeering and sex trafficking, but found guilty of two counts of a lesser prostitution-related charge.\n\nFADEL: Joining us now is NPR culture correspondent Anastasia Tsioulcas. She was at the court yesterday for the verdict. And a warning, this conversation includes mention of physical and sexual violence. Good morning.\n\nANASTASIA TSIOULCAS, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.\n\nFADEL: So walk us briefly through the verdict.\n\nTSIOULCAS: Sure thing. In short, Sean Combs was charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. And all of those accusations were related to two ex-girlfriends of Combs, a singer named Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura and a woman who testified under the pseudonym Jane. And both Jane and Ventura claimed they had been sexually trafficked to various locations across the country to participate in drug and sex marathons orchestrated by Combs with male sex workers. And Combs referred to these events as freak-offs or hotel nights. The women alleged that he had forced them to participate, and the defense argued those were all consensual encounters. So the jury found him not guilty of sex trafficking.\n\nThe government has also alleged that Combs used his vast business empire, which spans music, fashion, alcohol, media, and that he used some of his employees to aid and hide a number of other crimes, including bribery, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. That's the racketeering charge, and he was also acquitted of that charge.\n\nFADEL: OK, but the jury did find him guilty of one set of charges, right?\n\nTSIOULCAS: That's right, transportation to engage in prostitution. Some folks may have heard of that crime referred to as the Mann Act, and that's essentially bringing people across state lines for prostitution. So this jury, which was racially diverse and comprised of eight men and four women, found him guilty of two counts of that. But those are far less serious charges than the others. If Combs had been found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking, he would have been facing as much as life in prison. Each of the prostitution-related decisions instead carries a maximum sentence of 10 years apiece.\n\nFADEL: Now, Anastasia, you were at the court yesterday. What was that like?\n\nTSIOULCAS: Well, Leila, this whole trial has been a circus. I've been in court for many of the days. There have been all the regular media figures that you'd expect, but both the main courtroom and various overflow rooms have been packed with fans, tourists, sometimes families with small kids.\n\nFADEL: Wow.\n\nTSIOULCAS: TikTokers, YouTubers, all kinds of folks. And yesterday was no different. When the verdict was announced yesterday, you could hear gasps and cheers. Combs' family was crying. Some of his defense lawyers were crying. And after the verdict was read, Combs was down on the floor behind the defense table, kneeling in gratitude.\n\nFADEL: So after yesterday's verdict, where do things stand now?\n\nTSIOULCAS: Yesterday afternoon, the judge in this trial, Arun Subramanian, denied Combs bail per AP. The judge pointed out to Combs' defense team, they had admitted in court that he has a long history of violence. So he decided Combs will remain in custody until his sentence hearing.\n\nFADEL: That's NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas. Thank you so much.\n\nTSIOULCAS: You bet.\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR.

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Panics about the supposed threat of socialism or communism are hardly new to American history, so the reaction in some quarters to the presumed victory of Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, in last weeks New York mayoral primary wasnt surprising.Its officially hot commie summer, the hedge-fund billionaire Dan Loeb wrote on X. A bit more shocking, perhaps, was the response of the Harvard economist Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary during the Clinton Administration, who accused Mamdani of advocating Trotskyite economic policies, which was presumably a reference to his calls for a rent freeze, free bus rides, government-run grocery stores, and higher taxes on millionaires and corporations. (Summers also said Mamdani had shown a great ability to learn during the campaign and expressed the hope that he would provide much needed reassurance to believers in the market economy.)\n\nTo be sure, these reactions to what might be called Zohranomics didnt exactly stun Mamdanis supporters, many of whom take criticisms from financiers and centrist Democrats as confirmation they are on the right track. Summers never disappoints, does he? Isabella M. Weber, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who signed a public letter endorsing Mamdanis campaign proposals, told me during a lengthy conversation last week. Weber rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, when she called for government price controls and published detailed research about how big companies were taking advantage of the global emergency to raise their prices and profit margins. Responding to Summerss comments, she said that describing Mamdanis program as Trotskyite was absurd and didnt tell us anything about what Mamdanis agenda is trying to get at.\n\nIn the open letter, which The Nation published a few days before the primary, more than two dozen progressive economists from the United States and other countries described Mamdanis policy platform as a bold yet practical blueprint to tackle some of New York Citys most urgent challengesabove all, the cost of living. Weber told me that she felt Mamdani did very well in presenting himself as someone who stands up for the affordability of life and focusses on what I have been calling essentialsthe stuff that people cant do without: housing, food, transportation, and child care. If you cant afford that stuff, you are really pushed to the margins of society.\n\nWeber contrasted Mamdanis proposals with the equivocations of Joe Bidens Administration during the nationwide cost-of-living crisis that Donald Trump and other Republicans successfully exploited in last years election. She recounted how Biden, in his 2024 State of the Union speech, denounced corporations for capitalizing on a period of crisis by increasing their prices or reducing the size of their offerings, but then didnt do much about it. After Kamala Harris replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, she proposed a federal ban on price gouging by food suppliers and grocery stores. But she subsequently rowed back on the issue, Weber recalled, based on pressure from similar quarters that have been criticizing Mamdanis campaign.\n\nThe critique of Harriss proposal was that price controls dont work, and the same charge is being hurled at Mamdanis call for a rent freeze on roughly a million rent-stabilized apartments. (The freeze wouldnt apply to the citys million or so market-rate apartments.) In a controversial column that favored Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani but took aim at both, the New York Times editorial board said that a rent freeze could restrict housing supply and make it harder for younger New Yorkers and new arrivals to afford housing. The argument is that, if landlords and developers see a rent freeze, they would be deterred from investing in new affordable housing. When I put this point to Weber, she said that it was important to realize that Mamdanis call for a rent freeze is accompanied by a pledge to build an additional two hundred thousand rent-stabilized units over the next ten years; his campaign plans to accomplish this by expanding public investments, changing zoning laws, and fast-tracking planning approvals. If you only do a rent freeze without insuring that you also build, I dont think thats a great idea, Weber said. Given the severeness of the affordability crisis in New York City, the combination of a rent freeze and an aggressive build-out of affordable housing is a good idea.\n\nCreating more affordable housing is hardly a radical new mayoral goal, of course. In 2014, at the start of his eight-year tenure, Bill de Blasio also unveiled a plan to build or preserve two hundred thousand affordable apartments, and, in 2021, his administration announced that it had achieved this goal. Arguably, the most successful expansion of the citys affordable-housing stock came with the construction of public-housing projects, which began during the Great Depression under Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who established the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), and continued in the postwar decades. Subsequently, federal funding dried up, and public housing came to be associated with crime and other problems. In recent decades, New Yorks mayors have built affordable housing primarily through public-private partnerships, in which for-profit and not-for-profit developers receive tax breaks and other forms of support for putting up buildings that are privately managed. Mamdanis website says he will recommit to public housing, doubling the citys investment in major renovations of NYCHA housing and using NYCHA-owned land, such as parking lots, as sites for more affordable housinga proposal that de Blasio also championed.\n\nThat sounds sensible, and overdue, but the housing shortage facing the city is formidable: some recent studies say it needs to build as many as half a million new homes. Mamdani has put less emphasis on encouraging market-rate development. He has given a few nods to the abundance wing of the Democratic Party, such as pledging to eliminate parking minimums and encourage development around subway stations and other transport hubs. But the primary goal of his plan is to unleash the public sector to build housing for the many.\n\nAnother objective is to provide the citys residents with cheap and healthy food. The Mamdani campaign says that its new grocery stores would operate in city-owned buildings in low-income areas that currently lack adequate optionsso-called food deserts. It went on, Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. Before moving to Massachusetts, Weber once lived in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, where she sometimes found it difficult to shop for healthy foods. The price dimensionof Mamdanis proposalis important, but the other is the accessibility of nutritious food, she said.\n\nIts important to note, as some media accounts havent, that Mamdani is proposing a pilot scheme of just five new storesone in each borough. In a metropolis with more than fifteen thousand privately-owned supermarkets and grocery outlets, this seems like small beer. Nonetheless, Weber said that the experiment could be valuable. If it succeeded, it could be expanded, she noted, and ultimately it could encourage more competitive pricing in private stores: If you have an alternative that is reliably cheap and doesnt take advantage of opportunities to raise prices when they occur, that can change the pricing dynamic for whole sectors. That is potentially an important advantage that comes from having a public option.\n\nIn many peoples minds, the term public option is associated with health care. But public transportation is a public option, too, and, as Weber pointed out, the proposal to make bus rides free fits in with Mamdanis emphasis on basic needs. Affordable transportation options are essential for your basic material well-being, to get to a job, make money, and earn a living, she said. Some progressive thinkers and groups have extended the public option concept to other areas, including communications, financial services, and food retailing. In a recent article that cited Mamdanis proposal on grocery stores, Becky Chao, the director of policy and research at the Economic Security Project, wrote, Public options show whats possible when governments respond to local communities needs and build real alternatives for their constituents, when we grapple with the imbalance of power in our economy, and focus on marketshaping solutions that constrain corporate power while building power for all Americans. Of course, public options will only succeed if they deliver what they promise. For example, theres no guarantee that city-run grocery stores would be able to provide cheaper and more nutritious foods. Thats why you need a pilot, Weber acknowledged. To see if you can pull it off."

        "content": "Abortion rights protestors gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court in April for arguments in the Planned Parenthood case.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Thursday that states may exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from providing medical screenings and other healthcare for women on Medicaid.\n\nThe courts conservative majority cast aside the longstanding rule that said Medicaid patients may obtain medical care from any qualified provider.\n\nIn a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled the Medicaid Act does not give patients an individual right to the provider of their choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dispute turned on abortion, even though federal funds cannot be used for the procedure.\n\nMedicaid is funded by the federal government and the states. For decades, conservative states have sought to defund Planned Parenthood and argued they did not want to subsidize a leading provider of abortions.\n\nBut until recently, the federal government and most courts had held that Medicaid patients may go to any qualified provider for healthcare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legal battle hinged on whether the Medicaid Act gave a patients a right that could be protected in court. The answer was no, said Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, speaking for the majority.\n\nThe courts three liberals, all women, dissented.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the decision will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them. And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians  and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country  of a deeply personal freedom: the ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan agreed.\n\nIn theory, a Medicaid patient could file a complaint with the Trump administration and tell the Department of Health and Human Services that the state is failing to comply fully with the Medicaid Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlanned Parenthood clinics provide cancer screenings, birth control, medical screenings, pregnancy testing, contraception and other healthcare services.\n\nCongress pays most of the states costs for Medicaid, and the law says any individual eligible for medical assistance may receive care from any provider who is qualified to perform the service.\n\nLast year, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected South Carolinas contention that it could exclude Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program.\n\nWe reaffirm that a Medicaid beneficiary may ... vindicate her right under the Medicaid Act to freely choose among qualified healthcare providers, of which Planned Parenthood is one, wrote Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson, a prominent conservative and a Reagan appointee.\n\nBut the court agreed to hear the states appeal in Medina vs. Planned Parenthood.\n\nLupe Rodrguez, executive director of National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, called Thursdays decision an attack on our healthcare and our freedom to make our own decisions about our bodies and lives. By allowing states to block Medicaid patients from getting care at Planned Parenthood health centers, the Court has chosen politics over people and cruelty over compassion.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said it was yet another shameful ruling that inserts the government directly between a patient and their doctor  just like Dobbs three years ago and Skrmetti last week. Intimate, personal decisions about health care shouldnt require sign-off from extremist politicians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, shown in 2021, denied state Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood in 2018. (Meg Kinnard / Associated Press)\n\nHe was referring to the 2022 decision that overturned Roe vs. Wade and last weeks ruling upholding state laws that ban hormone treatment for transgender teens.\n\nCarol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, praised the decision as a landmark.\n\nWe are grateful the Supreme Court has recognized the right of states to direct taxpayer dollars toward life-affirming healthcare providers, she said. No one should be forced to subsidize the abortion industry with their tax dollars.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, South Carolina made most abortions a crime. But the state continued its legal fight to prevent Medicaid patients from receiving care at Planned Parenthoods clinics in Charleston and Columbia.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster, who issued the ban on Planned Parenthood in 2018, said he did so to protect his states sovereign interests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics of the move said the state has a severe shortage of doctors and medical personnel who treat low-income patients on Medicaid."

        "content": "The FBI is looking into a person or people pretending to be White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\n\nAn unknown impersonator reportedly sent texts and made phone calls to Wiles contacts, including prominent Republican politicians and business executives. Wiles has told her colleagues that her phones contacts were hacked, sources told the Journal. According to those sources, her personal cellphone, not her government device, was the one targeted.\n\nThe Journal reports that some of the individuals contacted believed that the messages came from Wiles, including one requesting a list of people that Trump could pardon. During phone calls, the impersonator reportedly used a voice that sounded like the chief of staffs, which may have been created via artificial intelligence, according to the report.\n\nBut those who were contacted eventually questioned the source of information when the impersonator asked for a cash transfer and began to make grammatical errors or use language that did not seem consistent with Wiles. The requests from the person posing as Wiles were also coming from a different phone number.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Wiles was reportedly the victim of an Iranian operation that hacked her email account. This time, the FBI has told the White House that it does not suspect foreign government involvement, according to the Journal.\n\nThe FBI takes all threats against the president, his staff, and our cybersecurity with the utmost seriousness, FBI Director Kash Patel told the Journal in a statement. Safeguarding our administration officials ability to securely communicate to accomplish the presidents mission is a top priority.\n\nA White House spokeswoman told the Journal that they take cybersecurity of all staff very seriously, and this matter continues to be investigated."

(Ha ha.)\n\nSeriously, its perfectly understandable why theres more gray on your scalp and deeper worry lines on your face. This last year has been challenging, to say the least.\n\nA convicted felon and adjudicated sex abuser was elected president  history made!  and ever since has worked tirelessly and diligently to establish himself as the nations first monarch, and a fabulously remunerated one at that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal troops are occupying the nations second-largest city, over the objection of the states leaders, as masked agents scoop people off the streets of Southern California for the temerity of venturing out with brown skin and an accent.\n\nOur social safety net is being shredded, the country is pulling back from its international leadership in the arts and science, and weve squandered our global standing as a beacon of hope and compassion.\n\nBut thats not all.\n\nVoices Barabak: By stooping to conquer, Sacramento Democrats show their pettiness and arrogance Hazing and silencing a GOP assemblyman also demonstrated contempt for the San Diego voters he represents. The juvenile behavior highlights a downside of single-party rule in California.\n\nPolitical violence is becoming about as familiar and normalized as schoolyard shootings. In roughly the last 12 months weve witnessed two attempts on Trumps life and the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedicaid, the program that serves millions of the needy, elderly and disabled, is on the chopping block. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps Americans weather the worst times after natural disaster, has been drastically depleted just as were heading into the fire and hurricane seasons.\n\nAs for the loyal opposition, Democrats are in bad odor with voters and even many of their own partisans after Joe Bidens handlers gaslighted the public on the frailty and declining faculties of the octogenarian president.\n\nOnly after a cataclysmically bad debate performance, which revealed his infirmities for all to see, did Biden grudgingly stand aside in favor of his anointed successor, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce more, Democrats are wandering the wilderness, wearing a familiar groove in their desolate pathway as they debate  again  whether to veer left or hug the center.\n\nThats quite the catalog.\n\nBut no one ever said this representative democracy thing was going to be easy, or endlessly uplifting.\n\nAmerica, youre a big, boisterous nation of more than 342 million people, with all sorts of competing impulses and interests, and no end of certitude to go around.\n\nIn our last presidential election, we split nearly evenly, with Trump squeaking past Harris in the popular vote 49.8% to 48.3%. It was one of the narrowest margins of victory in the last century, though you wouldnt know it from Trumps radical actions and the servility of the Republican-run Congress.\n\nBut our differences are more profound than the now-familiar gulf between red and blue America.\n\nIn a recently completed deep dive on the state of our democracy, researchers at UC Berkeley found an almost even divide over how to measure our political systems success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlightly more than half of those surveyed said a successful democracy is one thats adaptable and has the capacity for change, while nearly half said success stems from adherence to long-standing principles.\n\nWith that kind of stark disagreement on such a fundamental question, is it any wonder we struggle to find consensus on so much else?\n\nBut, heck, if its any consolation on this star-spangled holiday, the country has been through worse. Much worse. And you, America, have not only survived but also in many ways grown stronger by facing down your flaws and overcoming some knee-buckling challenges.\n\nSlavery. Civil war. Racist exclusionary laws. Two worldwide conflicts. Depression. Financial crises. And too many deadly natural disasters  floods, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes  to possibly count.\n\nYour treatment of some Americans, it should be said, hasnt always been fair and just.\n\nPeople are despairing over the Supreme Court and its deference to the president. But its worth noting that earlier court majorities held that Black Americans  beings of an inferior order, in the words of the notorious Dred Scott decision  could be denied citizenship, that racial segregation was constitutional and that compulsory sterilization based on eugenics was perfectly legal.\n\nThat sordid history wont necessarily make anyone feel better about the current state of affairs, nor should it. But it does give some perspective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoices Barabak: Newsom stood tall against Trump. Does that make him presidential timber? Californias governor has firmly responded to Trumps provocation and repeated assaults on the state. But its foolhardy to talk about him as any sort of front-runner for the White House in 2028.\n\nAll of that said, todays a day to celebrate the good things and the bright, shining place you aspire to be, with liberty and justice for all. So, chin up, America! Have another slice of birthday cake, and dont worry about the calories  you really do look terrific for 249!\n\nMeantime, its up to us, your citizens, to keep working toward that more perfect union. Whatever ails you, America, the remedy resides with we the people and the power we hold, particularly at the ballot box. Unhappy with the wrecking crew thats chain-sawing federal programs and allowing Trump to blowtorch the Constitution and rule of law? Vote em out, starting with the 2026 midterm election.\n\nDont give up hope or the belief that, as dark and difficult as things seem right now, better days lie ahead.\n\nThat abiding faith is what makes America great."

        "content": "CNN \n\nHigh speed trains have proved their worth across the world over the past 50 years.\n\nIts not just in reducing journey times, but more importantly, its in driving economic growth, creating jobs and bringing communities closer together. China, Japan and Europe lead the way.\n\nSo why doesnt the United States have a high-speed rail network like those?\n\nFor the richest and most economically successful nation on the planet, with an increasingly urbanized population of more than 300 million, its a position that is becoming more difficult to justify.\n\nAlthough Japan started the trend with its Shinkansen Bullet Trains in 1964, it was the advent of Frances TGV in the early 1980s that really kick-started a global high-speed train revolution that continues to gather pace.\n\nHigh-speed train revolution\n\nPassengers prepare to board a Shinkansen bullet train in Kyoto, Japan. Issei Kato/Reuters\n\nBut its a revolution that has so far bypassed the United States. Americans are still almost entirely reliant on congested highways or the headache-inducing stress of an airport and airline network prone to meltdowns.\n\nChina has built around 26,000 miles (42,000 kilometers) of dedicated high-speed railways since 2008 and plans to top 43,000 miles (70,000 kilometers) by 2035.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has just 375 route-miles of track cleared for operation at more than 100 mph.\n\nMany Americans have no concept of high-speed rail and fail to see its value. They are hopelessly stuck with a highway and airline mindset. William C. Vantuono, editor-in-chief of Railway Age\n\nMany Americans have no concept of high-speed rail and fail to see its value. They are hopelessly stuck with a highway and airline mindset, says William C. Vantuono, editor-in-chief of Railway Age, North Americas oldest railroad industry publication.\n\nCars and airliners have dominated long-distance travel in the United States since the 1950s, rapidly usurping a network of luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such as The Empire Builder, Super Chief and Silver Comet.\n\nDeserted by Hollywood movie stars and business travelers, famous railroads such as the New York Central were largely bankrupt by the early 1970s, handing over their loss-making trains to Amtrak, the national passenger train operator founded in 1971.\n\nIn the decades since that traumatic retrenchment, US freight railroads have largely flourished. Passenger rail seems to have been a very low priority for US lawmakers.\n\nPowerful airline, oil and auto industry lobbies in Washington have spent millions maintaining that superiority, but their position is weakening in the face of environmental concerns and worsening congestion.\n\nBillions for rail improvements\n\nUS President Joe Bidens $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill includes an unprecedented $170 billion for improving railroads.\n\nSome of this will be invested in repairing Amtraks crumbling Northeast Corridor (NEC) linking Boston, New York and Washington.\n\nThere are also big plans to bring passenger trains back to many more cities across the nation  providing fast, sustainable travel to cities and regions that have not seen a passenger train for decades.\n\nAdd to this the success of the privately funded Brightline operation in Florida, which has been given the green light to build a $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas by 2027, plus schemes in California, Texas and the proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle and Vancouver, and the United States at last appears to be on the cusp of a passenger rail revolution.\n\nBigger investment\n\nAmtrak plans to introduce its new generation Avelia Liberty trains to replace the Acelas, pictured, on the NEC later this year. David Boe/AP\n\nEvery president since Ronald Reagan has talked about the pressing need to improve infrastructure across the USA, but theyve always had other, bigger priorities to deal with, says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer of train builder Alstoms US division.\n\nBut now theres a huge impetus to get things moving  its a time of optimism. If we build it, they will come. As an industry, were maturing, and were ready to take the next step. Its time to focus on passenger rail.\n\nSherin points out that other public services such as highways and airports are massively subsidized, so there shouldnt be an issue with doing the same for rail.\n\nHigh-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place. Scott Sherin, CCO of Alstom's US division\n\nWe need to do a better job of articulating the benefits of high-speed rail  high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines  and that will help us to build bipartisan support, he adds. High-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.\n\nOnly Amtraks Northeast Corridor has trains that can travel at speeds approaching those of the 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph) TGV and Shinkansen.\n\nEven here, Amtrak Acela trains currently max out at 150 mph  and only in short bursts. Maximum speeds elsewhere are closer to 100 mph on congested tracks shared with commuter and freight trains.\n\nNew generation of trains\n\nThis year, Amtrak plans to introduce its new generation Avelia Liberty trains to replace the life-expired Acelas on the NEC.\n\nCapable of reaching 220 mph (although theyll be limited to 160 mph on the NEC), the trains will bring Alstoms latest high-speed rail technology to North America.\n\nThe locomotives at each end  known as power cars  are close relatives of the next generation TGV-M trains, scheduled to debut in France in 2024.\n\nSitting between the power cars are the passenger vehicles, which use Alstoms Tiltronix technology to run faster through curves by tilting their bodies, much like a MotoGP rider does. And its not just travelers who will benefit.\n\nWhen Amtrak awarded the contract to Alstom in 2015 to 2016, the company had around 200 employees in Hornell, says Shawn D. Hogan, former mayor of the city of Hornell in New York state.\n\nThat figure is now nearer 900, with hiring continuing at a fast pace. I calculate that there has been a total public/private investment of more than $269 million in our city since 2016, including a new hotel, a state-of-the-art hospital and housing developments.\n\nIt is a transformative economic development project that is basically unheard of in rural America and if it can happen here, it can happen throughout the United States.\n\nAlstom has spent almost $600 million on building a US supply chain for its high-speed trains  more than 80% of the train is made in the United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states.\n\nHigh-speed rail is already here. Avelia Liberty was designed jointly with our European colleagues, so we have what we need for TGV-USA, adds Sherin.\n\nIts all proven tech from existing trains. Were ready to go when the infrastructure arrives.\n\nAnd those new lines could arrive sooner than you might think.\n\nIncoming high-speed lines\n\nIn March, Brightline confirmed plans to begin construction on a 218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, carving a path through the San Bernardino Mountains and across the desert, following the Interstate 15 corridor.\n\nThe 200 mph line will slash times to little more than one hour  a massive advantage over the four-hour average by car or five to seven hours by bus  when it opens in 2027.\n\nMike Reininger, CEO of Brightline Holdings, says: As the most shovel-ready high-speed rail project in the United States, we are one step closer to leveling the playing field against transit and infrastructure projects around the world, and we are proud to be using Americas most skilled workers to get there.\n\nBrightline West expects to inject around $10 billion worth of benefits into the regions economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs, as well as 1,000 permanent jobs in maintenance, operations and customer service in Southern California and Nevada.\n\nIt will also mark the return of passenger trains to Las Vegas after a 30-year hiatus  Amtrak canceled its Desert Wind route in 1997.\n\nBrightline hopes to attract around 12 million of the 50 million one-way trips taken annually between Las Vegas and LA, 85% of which are taken by bus or car.\n\nAnother California project\n\nContruction is underway on California High Speed Rail (CHSR,) a high-speed system between Los Angeles and San Francisco. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, construction is progressing on another high-speed line through the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nSet to open around 2030, California High Speed Rail (CHSR) will run from Merced to Bakersfield (171 miles) at speeds of up to 220 mph.\n\nCoupled with proposed upgrades to commuter rail lines at either end, this project could eventually allow high-speed trains to run the 350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles to San Francisco metropolitan areas in just two hours and 40 minutes.\n\nCHSR has been on the table as far back as 1996, but its implementation has been controversial.\n\nDisagreements over the route, management issues, delays in land acquisition and construction, cost over-runs and inadequate funding for completing the entire system have plagued the project  despite the economic benefits it will deliver as well as reducing pollution and congestion. Around 10,000 people are already employed on the project.\n\nCosting $63 billion to $98 billion, depending on the final extent of the scheme, CHSR is to connect six of the 10 largest cities in the state and provide the same capacity as 4,200 miles of new highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates and two new airport runways costing between $122 billion and $199 billion.\n\nWith Californias population expected to grow to more than 45 million by 2050, high-speed rail offers the best value solution to keep the state from grinding to a smoggy halt.\n\nCorridors for the greatest potential\n\nBrightline West and CHSR offer templates for the future expansion of high-speed rail in North America.\n\nBy focusing on pairs of cities or regions that are too close for air travel and too far apart for car drivers, transportation planners can predict which corridors offer the greatest potential.\n\nIts logical that the US hasnt yet developed a nationwide high-speed network, says Sherin. For decades, traveling by car wasnt a hardship, but as highway congestion gets worse, weve reached a stage where we should start looking more seriously at the alternatives.\n\nThe magic numbers are centers of population with around three million people that are 200 to 500 miles apart, giving a trip time of less than three hours  preferably two hours.\n\nWhere those conditions apply in Europe and Asia, high-speed rail reduces airs share of the market from 100% to near zero. The model would work just as well in the USA as it does globally.\n\nPipe dream?\n\nFrench high-speed train the TGV Duplex, built in the 1990s, has a maximum speed of 186 miles per hour. Leoty X/Andia/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nSherin points to the success of the original generation of Acela trains as evidence of this.\n\nWhen the first generation Acela trains started running between New York City and Washington in 2000, Amtrak attracted so many travelers that the airlines stopped running their frequent shuttles between the two cities, he adds.\n\nHowever, industry observer Vantuono is more pessimistic.\n\nA US high-speed rail network is a pipe dream, he says. A lack of political support and federal financial support combined with the kind of fierce landowner opposition that CHSR has faced in California means that the challenges for new high-speed projects are enormous.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), urban and high-speed rail hold major promise to unlock substantial benefits in reducing global transport emissions.\n\nDespite the advent of cars and airplanes, rail of all types has continued to evolve and thrive. Fatih Birol, IEA executive director\n\nDr. Fatih Birol, the IEAs executive director, argues that rail transport is often neglected in public debates about future transport systems  and this is especially true in North America.\n\nDespite the advent of cars and airplanes, rail of all types has continued to evolve and thrive, adds Birol.\n\nGlobally, around three-quarters of rail passenger movements are made on electric-powered vehicles, putting the mode in a unique position to take advantage of the rise in renewable energy over the coming decades.\n\nHere, too, the United States lags far behind the rest of the world, with electrification almost unheard of away from the NEC.\n\nRail networks in South Korea, Japan, Europe, China and Russia are more than 60% electrified, according to IEA figures, the highest share of track electrification being South Korea at around 85%.\n\nIn North America, on the other hand, less than 5% of rail routes are electrified.\n\nThe enormous size of the United States and its widely dispersed population mitigates against the creation of a single, unified network of the type being built in China and proposed for Europe.\n\nAir travel is likely to remain the preferred option for transcontinental journeys that can be more than 3,000 miles (around 4,828 kilometers).\n\nBut there are many shorter inter-city travel corridors where high-speed rail, or a combination of new infrastructure and upgraded railroad tracks or tilting trains, could eventually provide an unbeatable alternative to air travel and highways."

Ultimately, Donald Trump will do what he can get away with, and whether a few points on his approval ratings are going to move the needle on this are unclear.\n\nJoining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times; Mark Leibovich, a staff writer at The Atlantic; Ali Vitali, the host of Way Too Early on MSNBC; Nancy Youssef, a national-security correspondent for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWatch the full episode here."

        "content": "When the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark Obergefell vs. Hodges case 10 years ago that same-sex couples have a right to marry nationwide, the sense of triumph was palpable. Celebrations broke out in the streets, and courthouses were flooded with newlyweds.\n\nBut that wasnt the only response.\n\nOpponents of LGBTQ+ rights immediately began implementing new strategies to limit the decisions reach and reverse the broader momentum toward LGBTQ+ acceptance, including by casting a small, less understood subset of the queer community  transgender people  as a growing threat to American families and values.\n\nRight after Obergefell, every effort to advance any equality measure was met with an anti-trans backlash, said Chase Strangio, a transgender attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union and one of the nations leading voices on LGBTQ+ legal rights.\n\nIn statehouses and governors mansions across the country, the number of bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights have increased year after year, with 800 being introduced this year alone. The Trump administration also has embraced the shift, with federal agencies aggressively investigating California and threatening its funding over its trans-inclusive policies. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that states may ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House is lighted in rainbow colors in 2015 after the Supreme Courts ruling to legalize same-sex marriage. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press)\n\nThe strategy has delighted many conservatives. But it has also frightened a community that had seen itself as being on a path toward progress, reviving discussions about the legacy of the Obergefell decision and igniting a fierce debate within the community about the wisdom of its political strategy over the past decade.\n\nSome have questioned whether the efforts since Obergefell to broaden transgender rights were pursued too fast, too soon, playing into the hands of the movements political foes. Others say those concerns sound strikingly similar to ones raised during the fight for marriage equality, when some argued that same-sex couples should settle for civil unions to avoid alienating religious moderates.\n\nThe conversation is not a comfortable one. Nerves are raw and fear is palpable. Some worry that pointing the finger will further embolden those working to dismantle LGBTQ+ rights. But others argue that a strategic reassessment is necessary after years of setbacks.\n\nThis can be an inflection point for how we move forward  whether we galvanize resources in [an] aligned effort to push back, [or] continue to let ourselves be divided by campaigns and movements and strategies that seek to divide us, Strangio said. Thats the real question for this moment.\n\nThe shifting debate\n\nStrangio, now co-director of the ACLUs LGBT & HIV Project, had worked on the Obergefell case and was outside the Supreme Court the day the decision came down. He thought about his younger self, and how impossible such a ruling would have seemed just years before  when state marriage bans were sweeping the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he didnt have much time to dwell on the victory, he said, as it became clear within minutes that anti-LGBTQ+ forces were already regrouping and preparing for the next fight.\n\nOne of their first targets was transgender peoples use of public bathrooms. Within months of the Obergefell decision, voters in Houston rejected an anti-discrimination measure after opponents falsely claimed that the ordinances gender-identity protections would allow sexual predators to enter womens bathrooms.\n\nIn 2016, North Carolina passed the nations first law barring transgender people from using bathrooms aligned with their identities. The measure sparked huge backlash and statewide boycotts, led in part by corporate America  and the bill was rolled back in 2017.\n\nPeople gather in North Carolina in 2016 to protest a restrictive bathroom bill. (Emery P. Dalesio / Associated Press)\n\nLGBTQ+ activists were jubilant, viewing North Carolinas embarrassment as a clear sign that history was on their side and that expanded transgender rights and protections were inevitable. And there would be big wins to come  including the 2020 Supreme Court ruling that the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBTQ+ employees from workplace discrimination nationwide.\n\nHowever, the tide was already beginning to shift, including as right-wing groups began to identify specific transgender issues that resonated with voters more than bathrooms, and as Trump  in his first term  began taking aim at transgender rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, said his organization poll tested all of these issues, the bathrooms, the showers, the locker rooms, and found that many were incredibly unpopular to voters  but some more than others.\n\nOne of the issues that resonated the most, Schilling said, was childrens healthcare and competition in girls sports. So his group ran with that, including in the 2019 race for governor in Kentucky, when it ran an ad suggesting that the Democratic candidate and ultimate victor  Andy Beshear  supported boys competing in girls wrestling competitions, when in fact Beshear supported policies barring discrimination based on childrens gender identity.\n\nSchilling said it was the lefts insistence that we need to start transing kids that made the issue a political one. But his groups strategy in Kentucky helped wake conservatives up to the political value of highlighting it.\n\nWere really just tapping into a real vulnerability that Democrats started for themselves, Schilling said.\n\nTrump had pursued various anti-transgender policies during his first term, including a ban on transgender service members. But during his campaign for reelection, he centered transgender issues like never before, dumping millions of dollars into anti-transgender ads that cast his opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, as an extreme progressive on such issues.\n\nKamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you, one ad said.\n\nOnce in office, Trump moved even more aggressively against transgender rights than the community had feared  prompting various lawsuits from LGBTQ+ organizations that are still pending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe issued an executive order declaring there are only two genders, and suggesting transgender people dont actually exist. He again banned transgender people from serving in the military. He threatened the funding of states such as California that have trans-inclusive school policies. He ordered transgender athletes out of youth sports. He said federal law enforcement would target those who provide gender-affirming care to minors. And his administration said it would stop providing transgender people with passports reflecting their identities.\n\nPresident Trump signs an executive order in February banning transgender athletes from participating in womens sports. (Jabin Botsford / Washington Post / Getty Images)\n\nHarrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said the American people voted for a return to common sense, and Trump was delivering on every campaign promise.\n\nPresident Trumps historic reelection and the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people, Fields said.\n\nFrom offense to defense\n\nReggie Greer, who served as a senior advisor on LGBTQI+ Persons at the State Department in the Biden administration, remembers being in North Carolina during the 2016 bathroom bill fight. While local Democrats were pleased with how it had backfired on Republicans, it was clear to him that hate is lucrative, Greer said  with the anti-rights groups raising hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nHe now sees the episode as an early warning of what was to come.\n\nNick Hutchins handled public affairs around the Obergefell case before joining the Human Rights Campaign, where he worked on state affairs and communications. Traveling through conservative states, he watched as more Republicans began seizing on LGBTQ+ issues after Trumps 2016 victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a moment when Republicans saw an opening and wanted to chip away at LGBTQ rights in any way they could, Hutchins said. Thats where you began to see a spaghetti-against-the-wall approach from their end, pursuing the bathroom bills that evolved into various education-focused bills, and healthcare.\n\nInside the Human Rights Campaign during Trumps first term, leadership felt confident that public opinion remained on their side. LGBTQ+ rights organizations had secured victories in statehouses on bathroom and healthcare issues, and were buoyed by Trumps electoral defeat in 2020.\n\nYet, several warning signs emerged. Internal state polling by the Human Rights Campaign found large majorities of Americans supported trans rights, but a plurality opposed allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports.\n\nOne former Human Rights Campaign staffer, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said the organization had not paid much attention to the issue until a series of political attacks in conservative states. The governors race in Kentucky was one, followed by a statehouse push in Louisiana.\n\nStill, other battles  including confronting whiteness in the movement  took precedent, the former staffer recalled.\n\nThere were significant generational divides within the organization between the older teams and their younger staff that were more diverse on these issues, the staffer said. It was a distraction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHutchins said LGBTQ+ organizations today are having autopsy conversations to take stock of how things have played out in recent years and identify lessons to be learned.\n\nLeaders look ahead\n\nAmong the most prominent leaders of the modern LGBTQ+ movement, there is consensus on many things.\n\nIts a scary time for LGBTQ+ people and other vulnerable groups, including immigrants and women. Trump represents an existential threat to American democracy. The LGBTQ+ rights movement needs more resources to continue fighting back. Nobody is going to throw transgender people under the bus just because some Democrats have suggested it would help them rebound politically.\n\nNo one person, no one community, is expendable. End of story, said Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the marriage case.\n\nThe actor Laverne Cox, one of the most recognizable transgender women in the country, said the marriage victory in 2015 left the right in need of a new boogeyman, and they picked transgender people  a tiny portion of the U.S. population, at around 1%.\n\nThey further picked on transgender people in sports  an even tinier group  in order to focus the conversation on hormones and physical ability, which is a great way to objectify trans people, to reduce us to our bodies, and thus dehumanize us, Cox said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best way to fight back, she said, is to refocus the conversation on transgender peoples humanity by allowing them to tell their own stories  rather than allowing their narratives to be hijacked by propaganda.\n\nThe actor Laverne Cox, shown in April, said trans people should be able to tell their own stories. (Andy Kropa / Invision / Associated Press)\n\nWere just like everybody else in terms of what we want, need, desire, our hopes and fears, she said. Living authentically and being able to be oneself is where the focus should be.\n\nEvan Wolfson, an attorney and founder of the advocacy group Freedom to Marry, which is widely credited with securing the 2015 victory in the Obergefell case, said there are three significant factors that got the country to where it is today on transgender issues.\n\nThe most important factor by far, he said, is the right-wing attack machine and the political agenda of some who are trying to attack and scapegoat and divide the country around transgender issues.\n\nA second factor, he said, is that transgender identities are still a relatively new concept for many Americans, and that conversation is just not as far along as the very long conversation about who gay people are.\n\nA third and far less significant factor, he said, are the missteps by LGBTQ+ advocates in the last decade, including some vocally renouncing anyone who is not 100% supportive of trans rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe worked hard in the Freedom to Marry campaign to bring people along and to distinguish between those who were our true opponents, those who were really anti-gay, anti-rights, anti-inclusion on the one hand, and those who I called the reachable but not yet reached  people who werent with us, but werent our true opponents, people who were still wrestling with the question, Wolfson said.\n\nAllowing people a bit more time and space to be brought along on transgender issues will be necessary moving forward, he said  though he stressed that does not mean that advocates should slow down or pull back.\n\nWolfson rejected the idea that the LGBTQ+ community is moving too fast on transgender rights, which was also argued about marriage, and the idea that transgender rights should be abandoned as a political liability. There is no reason to believe that we would profit from selling out our principles and doing the wrong thing just to avoid this tough moment, Wolfson said.\n\nStrangio said the fight for LGBTQ+ rights today cannot be viewed in a vacuum, and that zooming out, there are a lot of reasons to be concerned about basic constitutional principles and civil rights protections for all sorts of vulnerable people under the Trump administration.\n\nStill, he said, he believes in the queer communitys ability to move through setbacks and come out ahead of the billion-dollar global campaigns to undermine equality protections that began after the Obergefell decision.\n\nFighting back was the right course, he said, and continuing to assess how we can effectively build support for the entire community is going to be a critical part of this next decade."

        "content": "When a group of armed, masked men was spotted dragging a woman into an SUV in the Fashion District last week, a witness called 911 to report a kidnapping.\n\nBut when Los Angeles Police Department officers arrived, instead of making arrests, they formed a line to protect the alleged abductors from an angry crowd of onlookers demanding the womans release.\n\nThe reported kidnappers, it turned out, were special agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice Chief Jim McDonnell defended the officers response, saying their first responsibility was to keep the peace and that they had no authority to interfere with the federal operation.\n\nIn political and activist circles, and across social media, critics blasted the LAPD for holding back the crowd instead of investigating why the agents were arresting the woman, who was later found to be a U.S. citizen.\n\nWhat happened downtown on Tuesday morning certainly looked and felt like LAPD was supporting ICE, said Mike Bonin, a former City Council member who is now executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State L.A.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKimberly Noriega, left, speaks with her aunt, Anita Neri Lozano, at Veterans Memorial Park in Culver City on Sunday. The family was attending a news conference regarding the arrest of a beloved street vendor, Ambrocio Lozano. (Luke Johnson / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe incident was one of more than half a dozen in recent weeks in which the LAPD responded to federal immigration enforcement actions that were called in as kidnappings.\n\nThe presence of local police officers at the scenes  even if they are not actively assisting ICE  has led some city leaders to question the departments role in an ongoing White House crackdown that has swept up hundreds of immigrants and sown fear across Southern California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncidents of impostors masquerading as law enforcement have compounded the situation, along with rumors  so far unverified  that federal authorities have enlisted bounty hunters or private security contractors for immigration arrests.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called coverage of one reported kidnapping a hoax in a post Tuesday on X and said: ICE does not employ bounty hunters to make arrests.\n\nIn a letter to the Police Commission last week, City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez said the LAPD should make sure federal agents who cover their faces and often use unmarked vehicles are who they claim to be.\n\nOur residents have a right to know who is operating in their neighborhoods and under what legal authority, wrote Rodriguez, whose district includes the San Fernando Valley. Allowing unidentified actors to forcibly detain individuals without oversight is not only reckless  it erodes public trust and undermines the very rule of law.\n\nShe said that city leaders couldnt allow bounty-hunter-style tactics to take root in our city, and urged the commission, the LAPDs civilian policymaking body, to develop proper legal and safe protocol that provide for officer safety, transparency and accountability to our communities.\n\nResidents stand behind a line of Vernon police officers after an immigration raid in the city of Bell on June 20. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis lack of identification is unacceptable. It creates an environment ripe for abuse and impersonation, enabling copycat vigilantes to pose as federal agents, Rodriguez wrote.\n\nState and local officials have proposed legislation to increase transparency around officer identification, but its unclear if the bills will become law  and whether they could actually be enforced against federal agents.\n\nPolice Commission President Erroll Southers said Tuesday that he and another commissioner met with City Council members to discuss the Police Departments response to the Trump administrations aggressive sweeps. Several commissioners questioned McDonnell about how LAPD officers are supposed to respond to reported kidnappings.\n\nLos Angeles police officers stand guard as community members protest recent immigration raids in front of the Federal Building in downtown L.A. on June 18. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nMcDonnell said the department created new guidelines that require a supervisor to respond and instruct LAPD officers to verify the purported ICE agents are legitimate, preserving a record of the interaction on body-worn cameras.\n\nThe chief said the top priority for officers is maintaining the safety of all those present, but ultimately officers have no authority to interfere with a federal operation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a new poll from YouGov, a public opinion research firm, nearly three-quarters of Californians believe local police officers should arrest federal immigration agents who act maliciously or knowingly exceed their authority under federal law.\n\nThe same survey also found that a majority of state residents want to completely forbid California officials from collaborating with immigration enforcement and make it easier for citizens to file lawsuits when authorities violate the due process rights of immigrants.\n\nThe LAPD has long claimed that it has no role in civil immigration enforcement, but the department is now facing pressure from City Hall and beyond to go further and protect Angelenos who are undocumented.\n\nA motion considered this week by the L.A.

(Christina House / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLAPD officials say that the department has responded to at least seven calls in which people contacted 911 to report a kidnapping that turned out to be an ICE operation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne emergency call came in when a group of masked federal Border Patrol agents was spotted staging near Dodgers Stadium last week, sparking a wave of speculation online about potential immigration enforcement at the ballpark. LAPD officers responded to the scene and again provided crowd control after a group of protesters showed up.\n\nSeveral police supervisors said that in the past, it was customary for federal agents conducting surveillance in a given LAPD division to give the areas watch commander a heads-up as a courtesy. But that longstanding practice has ended, leaving them largely left in the dark about the timing and location of planned immigration raids.\n\nCmdr. Lillian Carranza said it was irresponsible for people to describe the arrests as kidnappings and encourage people to call 911, saying that there is misinformation circulating online about how and when federal authorities can arrest someone. Authorities dont need to present a warrant when encountering someone on the street, she said; all they need is probable cause.\n\nIf people have concerns about the conduct of federal agents, they need to seek justice in court, she said. That is the place to litigate the case. Not the streets.\n\nIn a testy exchange last month, McDonnell told the City Council that even if he knew about an immigration operation beforehand, he would not alert city leaders.\n\nThe LAPDs relationship with ICE has been the subject of intense debate on social media platforms such as Reddit, where some commenters argued that the departments focus on policing protesters was a tacit endorsement of the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the discussion has fixated on an incident that occurred last week in downtown Los Angeles in which a woman named Andrea Guadalupe Velez was detained by agents clad in bulletproof vests with gaiters over their faces.\n\nA livestream video showed a man, Luis Hipolito, who was later arrested, asking agents for their names and badge numbers.\n\nIm calling 911 right now, he told the agents.\n\n911, I want to report a crime. I want to report a crime, Hipolito is heard saying on the phone.\n\nWhat are you reporting? an operator is heard asking.\n\nTheyre kidnapping kids, theyre kidnapping people on Nine and Main Street, he is heard saying. I need LAPD right here, right now. Nine and Main Street. Theyre kidnapping, theyre kidnapping people.\n\nAfter several agents were seen piling on top of Hipolito, LAPD officers arrived at the scene. They formed a line between the agents and the angry crowd, members of whom were shouting to release Hipolito.\n\nHomeland Securitys McLaughlin said Velez was arrested for assaulting an ICE enforcement officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal authorities said in court filings that Velez abruptly stepped into the path of an agent in an apparent effort to prevent him from apprehending the male subject he was chasing.\n\nVelez, a Cal Poly Pomona graduate who is 4 feet 11, allegedly stood in the path of the agent with her arms extended. The agent couldnt stop in time and was struck in his head and chest, federal authorities allege.\n\nVelezs mother, Margarita Flores, was watching in her rearview mirror, having just dropped her daughter off at the scene.\n\nFlores said she saw a man running toward her daughter and then Velez falling to the ground. Flores said the men didnt have identification or license plates on their car.\n\nFearing a kidnapping, she told her other daughter, Estrella Rosas, to call the police. When the LAPD arrived, Rosas said, her sister went running to one of the police officers in hopes that they could help her.\n\nBut one of the ICE agents went back after her and fully [put] her in handcuffs, Rosas said. He physically had to carry her to put her inside the car and they drove away in the car that had no license plates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVelez spent two days in a federal detention facility. Charged with assaulting a federal officer, she made her initial court appearance last week and was released on $5,000 bail. She has not yet entered a plea and is due back in court July 17.\n\nTimes staff writer Brittny Mejia contributed to this report."

The area is especially popular around the July Fourth holiday, making it more difficult to know how many are missing.\n\nWe dont even want to begin to estimate at this time, City Manager Dalton Rice said Saturday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaging storm hit camp in middle of the night\n\nThe camp was completely destroyed, said Elinor Lester, 13, one of hundreds of campers at Camp Mystic. A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.\n\nA raging storm fueled by incredible amounts of moisture woke up her cabin just after midnight Friday, and when rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with floodwaters whipping around their legs, she said.\n\nFrantic parents and families posted photos of missing loved ones and pleas for information.\n\nOn Saturday, the camp was mostly deserted. Helicopters roared above as a few people looked at the damage, including a pickup truck tossed onto its side and a building missing its front wall.\n\nAmong those confirmed dead were an 8-year-old girl from Mountain Brook, Ala., who was staying at Camp Mystic, and the director of another camp just up the road.\n\nThe flooding in the middle of the night on the Fourth of July holiday caught many residents, campers and officials by surprise in the Texas Hill Country, which sits northwest of San Antonio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccuWeather said the private forecasting company and the National Weather Service sent warnings about potential flash flooding hours before the devastation.\n\nThese warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety, AccuWeather said in a statement that called the Texas Hill Country one of the most flash-flood-prone areas of the U.S. because of its terrain and many water crossings.\n\nOfficials defended their actions Friday while saying they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months worth of rain for the area.\n\nOne National Weather Service forecast earlier in the week had called for up to 6 inches of rain, Kidd said. It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw, he said.\n\nHelicopters, drones used in frantic search for missing\n\nSearch crews were facing harsh conditions while looking in every possible location, Rice said.\n\nAuthorities said about 850 people had been rescued. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters were flying in to assist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne reunification center at an elementary school was mostly quiet Saturday after taking in hundreds of evacuees the day before.\n\nWe still have people coming here looking for their loved ones. Weve had a little success, but not much, said Bobby Templeton, superintendent of Ingram Independent School District.\n\nPresident Trump said Saturday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was traveling to Texas and that his administration was working with officials on the ground.\n\nMelania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy, Trump said in a statement on his social media network.\n\nPitch black wall of death\n\nIn Ingram, Erin Burgess woke to thunder and rain in the middle of the night Friday. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home from the river, she said. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree with her teenage son and waiting for the water to recede enough to walk up the hill to safety.\n\nThankfully hes over 6 feet tall. Thats the only thing that saved me, was hanging on to him, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them, she said.\n\nMatthew Stone, 44, of Kerrville, said police came knocking on doors but that he had received no warning on his phone.\n\nWe got no emergency alert. There was nothing, Stone said. Then a pitch black wall of death.\n\nI was scared to death\n\nAt a reunification center in Ingram, families cried and cheered as loved ones got off rescue vehicles. Two soldiers carried an older woman who could not get down a ladder. Behind her, a woman clutched a small white dog.\n\nLater, a girl in a white Camp Mystic T-shirt and white socks stood in a puddle, sobbing in her mothers arms.\n\nBarry Adelman said water pushed everyone in his three-story house into the attic, including his 94-year-old grandmother and 9-year-old grandson. Water started coming through the attic floor before receding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was horrified, he said. I was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death.\n\nNo one knew this kind of flood was coming\n\nThe forecast for the weekend had called for rain, with a flood watch upgraded to a warning overnight Friday for at least 30,000 people.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area.\n\nEverything was done to give them a heads up that you could have heavy rain, and were not exactly sure where its going to land, Patrick said. Obviously as it got dark last night, we got into the wee morning of the hours, thats when the storm started to zero in.\n\nKerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the countys chief elected official, said: We do not have a warning system.\n\nWhen pushed on why more precautions werent taken, Kelly said no one knew this kind of flood was coming.\n\nMore pockets of heavy rains expected\n\nThe slow-moving storm stuck over central Texas is expected to bring more rain Saturday, with the potential for pockets of heavy downpours and more flooding, said Jason Runyen, of the National Weather Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe threat could linger overnight and into Sunday morning, he said.\n\nThe area is known as flash flood alley because of the hills thin layer of soil, said Austin Dickson, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, which was collecting donations to help nonprofits responding to the disaster.\n\nWhen it rains, water doesnt soak into the soil, Dickson said. It rushes down the hill.\n\nThe river tourism industry is a key part of the Hill Country economy. Well-known, century-old summer camps bring in kids from all over the country, Dickson said.\n\nIts generally a very tranquil river with really beautiful clear blue water that people have been attracted to for generations, Dickson said.\n\nSeewer and Vertuno write for the Associated Press.\n\n"

        "content": "The first time I glimpsed the city of New Orleans, I was a small boy in the wheelhouse of a tugboat. My father pushed barges up and down the Mississippi River, and sometimes he let me tag along. The city seemed so luminous at nightso different from tiny Convent, Louisiana, where I was fromthat it felt otherworldly and inaccessible. In 2020, I moved there during a painful divorce. Because of that childhood memory, my relocation felt somehow transgressive. I was going where I did not belong.\n\nShortly thereafter, I began to notice the cats. About a dozen lingered, lazy yet alert, behind my apartment complex. Whenever someone approached, they scattered and hid beneath the building. (I found their behavior relatable.) One evening, I came upon a lean and scraggly cat on the sidewalk that looked dead. Upon closer inspection, I saw that her eyes were swollen shut. She scurried off when I reached out to comfort her.\n\nThat night, I stared at my ceiling, worrying that the cat would waste away or wander into traffic. The next morning, I left out something for her to eat. A friend suggested that I research trap, neuter, return groups, which sterilize and vaccinate feral cats.\n\nTwo days later, I met Nita Hemeter, the short, bespectacled co-founder of a nonprofit called Trap Dat Cat, in front of her pink house. Her face bore the weary bemusement of a veteran of some terrible war. She told me that she had started rescuing animals after reading Animal Liberation, by the philosopher Peter Singer, and she lent me two traps. Ive been trying for years to get someone to volunteer to trap at that apartment, she told me. If I succeeded in my mission, she went on, her organization would find the cat a veterinarian.\n\nI baited the traps with mackerel, per Nitas instructions. Cats sniffed through the wires; one sat on top, as if mocking my efforts, and another crawled inside. But the injured cat appeared only once, uninterested in the trap. After two nights, I resorted to a backup plan: giving out food directly, in hopes of rallying her immune system. Her fellow-cats werent going to wait for her to find her Friskies, so this effectively meant feeding the entire colony every day and night. Within a few weeks, Squinty Cat was letting me stand beside her while she ate, and her eyes seemed healed. But now I had a different problem. The cats expected me.\n\nMy nightly rounds, which cost a fortune in cat food, continued even after I moved to a new apartment. (My daughter joked that the cats had given me toxoplasmosis and were controlling my mind.) The traps worked fine on other cats; each time a newcomer appeared, I trapped her, brought her to Nita, and released her after a vet neutered and vaccinated her. Each one must have felt like she was being briefly abducted by a U.F.O.\n\nThe cats led me, in a roundabout way, to a dog. Three years after I adopted the colony, while checking my mailbox, I made eye contact with a woman who was stapling signs to telephone poles: Michelle Cheramie, the founding director of Zeus Rescues, another local nonprofit. I knew her organization well; Id adopted two house cats from Zeus. I lost my dog here in Mid-City, she said, and handed me a flyer, which I accepted out of politeness. LOST, it read. PINK COLLAR, BROWN SPOTS. IF YOU SEE SCRIM, DONT CHASE. It featured a shaggy white dog with sad eyes and floppy ears, along with her phone number.\n\nI was not planning to look for the dog. If anything, I planned to look away. I didnt have the capacity to care for more animals, and I knew Id feel beholden to any needy creature I saw. But it was difficult to ignore the van from Zeus Rescues, which started turning up at all hours. Whenever someone reported a sighting, Michelle posted the location on social media.\n\nLate one night, weeks later, while depressed and doomscrolling in bed, I came across a string of recent Scrim sightings at intersections near my house. If you are in the area, please text with location, direction headed and a picture if you can get one, Michelle wrote. I dont know why I went out that night. Im not even a dog person. But it was that or reflect on every mistake Id ever made.\n\nTwo minutes later, two blocks from home, I saw hima seventeen-pound mutt sniffing around someones garden. I kept my distance and messaged Michelle. Immediately, she called me. The rescue van is just around the corner, she said. Keep an eye on him. The street was poorly lit, with gnarled tree roots that animals could hide behind; passing cars created their own roving shadows. Scrim vanished.\n\nWhen the van rolled up behind me, Tammy Murray, a woman in a T-shirt and yoga pants, climbed out. She seemed to be not much older than me, perhaps in her early fifties, and she looked exhausted. I told her what had happened. He does that, she said. I live in Mid-City, a historically working-class residential area that is more laid-back and lived-in than the French Quarter, a couple miles away. Its known for colorful shotgun houses, which are tightly clustered and raised against flooding. Tammy typically brought snares or a net gun to Scrim encounters, but he could duck under a house and emerge a block away.\n\nMichelle originally rescued Scrim from a kill shelter in November, 2023, shortly before he was set to be euthanized. He was physically healthy but behaved like a dog whod experienced abuse and neglect. During a three-month foster placement, he was docile and frightened, but not aggressive. Then, on the first night of a trial adoption in Mid-City, he escaped.\n\nTammy and her partner, Freba Maulauizada, both lived in Mid-City and had backgrounds in animal rescue, so a couple days after he got loose they volunteered to help. Michelle lived Uptown, twenty minutes away, so she gave them the keys to the rescue van. But Scrim wasnt food-motivated and ignored traps. You couldnt get close enough to use a catch pole or a net. He had lost-dog syndrome, which meant that he was fear-driven and survival-focussed, and he responded to calls by running.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Michelle asked people to share footage of Scrim from home-security cameras. A record-breaking heat wave settled in, and Scrim was moving only at night. Volunteers organized a neighborhood-wide stakeout, which had the feel of a quiet, quintessentially New Orleans block partypeople sitting on porches, drinking wine. I manned a street corner from 11 P.M. to 3 A.M. Even then, there were so many people patrolling the area that Google Maps showed standstill traffic. None of them found Scrim.\n\nAfter that first night, I found myself driving the long way home from my cat colony. For reasons that werent clear to me, I went for early-morning walks and evening runs in places where hed been spotted. I often saw Tammy in the van. I also noticed a middle-aged woman, who had short blond hair and bright-blue eyes, zipping around on an electric scooter at odd hours and in odd places. Finally, driving by one day, I rolled down my window and asked what she was doing.\n\nLooking for that dog, she said in a melodic New Orleans accent. Her name was Barbara Burger, and she worked as a court reporter. Each night, she drove twenty minutes from the suburb of River Ridge to help. Its so sad that hes still running the streets, she told me. She, too, tended to a cat colony.\n\nSometimes, I saw a tattooed woman in her early thirties, serenely riding her bicycle. I assumed that she was either dealing drugs or searching for Scrim. Eventually, she introduced herself as Bonnie Goodson. Im six years sober, living in New Orleans, so I dabble in insomnia, she told me. Shed always been too scared of bad drivers to bike in the city, but she felt safer at night.\n\nBy late July, Tammy, Michelle, Barbara, Bonnie, and I were sharing updates over a walkie-talkie app called Zello. It wasnt exactly a social activity; the only way to cover a lot of ground was to avoid one another. But we were seeing our city in a new way. Michelle heard updates from cops and sex workers; even people who stole catalytic converters from cars started to look familiar. We also learned about each other. Michelle, whod previously worked in I.T., started Zeus after seeing the plight of animals during Hurricane Katrina. Bonnie had been in the film industry for fifteen years. Freba, I learned, had migrated to the United States from Afghanistan after the Soviets invaded. When Tammy told her that I had done a tour of duty there, she lit up and said, Youve been to my country? We often talked about her homeland. She once wrote that, as a gay Muslim person in a red state, she identified with the way pit bulls are stereotyped and stigmatized."

        "content": "In The Godfather, a Mafia turncoat appears before a Senate committee in order to testify as a protected witness about its operations. Frank Pentangeli, Frankie Five Angels, a capo allied with the old godfather, Vito Corleone, has had a falling out with the new one, his son Michael Corleone, who attempted to assassinate him. As Pentangeli is about to speak at the hearing, he notices his brother Vincenzo, a mafioso from Sicily, seated behind him. Michael has arranged his grim looming presence. Pentangeli is suddenly reminded of his oath of omerta, the code of silence. He recants on the spot, saying that he just told the FBI what they wanted to hear.\n\nOn 25 June, Emil Bove, Donald Trumps former personal attorney, whom he had named associate deputy attorney general, and now after five months seeks to elevate as a federal judge on the US third circuit court of appeals, appeared before the Senate judiciary committee for his confirmation hearing. He faced, at least potentially, a far-ranging inquiry into his checkered career.\n\nThere were charges of abusive behavior as an assistant US attorney. There was his role as enforcer of the alleged extortion of New York City Mayor Eric Adams to cooperate in the Trump administrations migrant roundups in exchange for dropping the federal corruption case against him. There was Boves dismissal of FBI agents and prosecutors who investigated the January 6 insurrection. And there was more.\n\nOn the eve of the hearing, the committee received a shocking letter from a whistleblower, a Department of Justice attorney, who claimed that Bove said, in response to a federal court ruling against the administrations immigration deportation policy: DoJ would need to consider telling the courts fuck you and ignore any such order.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the committee chairperson, the ancient mariner of the right wing at 91 years old, gaveled the session to order by invoking new rules never before used with a nominee in a confirmation hearing. Instead of opening the questioning to examine the nominees past, he would thwart it. Grassley announced that Bove would be shielded by the deliberative-process privilege and attorney-client privilege from an intense opposition campaign by my Democratic colleagues and by their media allies. This was the unique imposition of a code of omerta.\n\nMy understanding is that Congress has never accepted the constitutional validity of either such privilege, objected Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. This witness has no right to invoke that privilege, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. But Grassley stonewalled.\n\nProminently seated in the audience behind Bove were the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche. Never before had such top officials been present at a confirmation hearing for a judicial nominee. The federal government through the justice department would inevitably appear in cases before his court. The attorney general and her deputy created an immediate perception of conflict of interest, an ethical travesty.\n\nBut Bondi and Blanche were not there to silence Bove. They were there to intimidate the Republican senators. If there were any dissenters among them, they knew that they would suffer retribution. Their being here is for one reason  to whip the Republicans into shape, said Blumenthal. To make sure that they toe the line. They are watching.\n\nThe rise of Emil Bove is the story of how a lawyer from the ranks associated himself with Donald Trump, proved his unswerving loyalty to become a made man, and has been richly rewarded with a nomination for a lifetime federal judgeship, presumably to continue his service. In his opening statement, Bove said: I want to be clear about one thing up front: there is a wildly inaccurate caricature of me in the mainstream media. Im not anybodys henchman. Im not an enforcer.\n\nThe rise of Emil Bove is the story of a lawyer associating himself with Trump, proving his unswerving loyalty and being richly rewarded\n\nBove began his career as a paralegal and then a prosecutor in the US attorneys office for the southern district of New York. He was known for his attention to detail, relentlessness and sharp elbows. Seeking a promotion to supervisor, a group of defense attorneys including some who had been prosecutors in his office wrote a letter claiming he had deployed questionable tactics, including threatening defendants with increasingly severe charges the lawyers believed he couldnt prove, according to Politico. Bove posted the letter in his office to display his contempt. He was denied the promotion, but eventually received it.\n\nAs a supervisor, Bove was known as angry, belittling and difficult. He developed an abrasive relationship with FBI agents. After complaints, an executive committee in the US attorneys office investigated and suggested he be demoted. He pleaded he would exercise more self-control and was allowed to remain in his post. You are aware of this inquiry and their recommendation? Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, asked Bove about the incident. Bove replied: As well as the fact that I was not removed.\n\nIn 2021, in the prosecution of an individual accused of evading sanctions on Iran, a team Bove supervised as the unit chief won a jury verdict. But then the US attorneys office discovered the case was marred by repeated failures to disclose exculpatory evidence and misuse of search-warrant returns by the prosecutors handling the case, according to the judge. Declaring that errors and ethical lapses in this case are pervasive, she vacated the verdict and dismissed the charges as well as chastising those prosecutors for falling short of their constitutional and ethical obligations in this unfortunate chapter and criticizing Bove for providing sufficient supervision to prevent those failures.\n\nBove became a private attorney, joining the law firm of Todd Blanche, whom Trump hired in 2023 to defend him in the New York case involving his payment of hush-money to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels. Blanche brought Bove along as his second chair. The qualities that made him a black sheep in the US attorneys office recommended him to Blanche and his client. In Boves questioning of David Pecker, publisher of the National Enquirer, about his payments to women in his catch-and-kill scheme to protect Trump, Bove twice botched the presentation of evidence, was admonished by the judge and apologized. Trump was convicted of 34 felonies of financial fraud to subvert an election.\n\nUpon Trumps election, he appointed Bove as acting deputy attorney general and then associate deputy once Todd Blanche was confirmed as deputy, reuniting the law partners, both Trump defense attorneys now resuming that role in an official capacity.\n\nOn 31 January, Bove sent two memos, the first firing dozens of justice department prosecutors and the second firing FBI agents who had worked on the cases of January 6 insurrectionists, whom Trump pardoned on his inauguration day. Bove quoted Trump that their convictions were a grave national injustice. He also had his own history of conflict with fellow prosecutors and FBI agents.\n\nAsked about his actions by Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, Bove presented himself as even-handed. I did and continue to condemn unlawful behavior, particularly violence against law enforcement, he said. At the same time, I condemn heavy-handed and unnecessary tactics by prosecutors and agents.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The head of the criminal division at the US attorneys office of the District of Columbia, Denise Cheung, believing there was no factual basis to the accusation, resigned with a statement praising those who are following the facts and the law and complying with our moral, ethical and legal obligations.\n\nWhen Whitehouse sought to ask Bove about the episode, Bove replied: My answer is limited to: I participated in the matter. Whitehouse turned to Grassley. Do you see my point now? he said. The code of omerta was working to frustrate questioning.\n\nBove also deflected questions about his central role in the dropping of charges against Eric Adams. The acting US attorney for the southern district of New York, Danielle Sassoon, had resigned in protest, writing in a letter that Boves memo directing her to dismiss the charges had nothing to do with the strength of the case. She noted that in the meeting to fix what amounted to a quid pro quo  Mr Bove admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meetings conclusion.\n\nQuestioned about the Adams scandal, Bove denied any wrongdoing. Senator John A Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, played his helpmate. He asked Bove to swear to your higher being that there was no quid pro quo. Absolutely not, Bove said. Do you swear on your higher being? On every bone in my body, Bove replied. Hallelujah!\n\nThen Bove was asked about the letter sent by former justice department lawyer Erez Reuveni alleging that Bove planned the defiance of court rulings against the administrations deportation policy. I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order, Bove said.\n\nSenator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, repeatedly asked him if it was true he had said fuck you as his suggested plan of action against adverse court decisions. Bove hemmed and hawed, and finally said: I dont recall. Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, remarked: I am hoping more evidence is going to come out that shows that you lied before this committee.\n\nGrassley, however, succeeded in protecting Bove. Bondi and Blanche stared down the Republican senators whose majority can put Bove on the bench. He is Trumps model appointment of what he wants in a judge. In announcing his nomination, Trump tweeted: Emil Bove will never let you down!\n\nIn another scene in The Godfather, Virgil The Turk Sollozzo, another Mafia boss, comes to Vito Corleone, offering a deal to cut him in on the narcotics trade. I need, Don Corleone, he says, those judges that you carry in your pockets like so many nickels and dimes. It was an offer that the Godfather refused. He left the drugs, but kept the judges."

        "content": "Im changing society, not you! yells far-right conspiracy theorist and creator of Infowars, Alex Jones, at a random citizen of Seattle who heckled him during his live news broadcast.\n\nJones was broadcasting live from the streets of Seattle, which according to him is home to the biggest cucks on the planet. Maybe its a bit of performance art and maybe its people screaming at him. Either way, its a wonderful piece of video.\n\nOne woman approached Jones during his broadcast on a street corner and told him, I just wanted to stop and tell you that I think your show is terrible. Jones attempted to ask her questions about the economy under President Donald Trump and how newspapers, he claimed, said that the economy was going to implode after various CEOs resigned from an economic advisory board because of his failure to properly condemn violence in Charlottesville. The president ultimately dismantled the board.\n\nCome on over here, come on over here, Jones insisted at a man who flipped him off. No you flipped me off, come on coward. Youre not an intellectual; youre a fake and a fraud.\n\nThe man then crossed the street after Jones confronted him and tauntingly flipped Jones off again with both of his hands. The Infowars host was riled up and chased after him as if he were the T-1000 in the movie Terminator 2. Jones caught up with the man and stepped in front of him while continuing to yell at him.\n\nFuck off, the man can be heard saying.\n\nNo you fuck off, Jones said.\n\nI am fucking off, the man said with a grin as he walked away.\n\nAfter further banter Jones said you know something, Im not afraid of you people. You got something to say, say it. You have nothing intellectual.\n\nIn the next scene a man can be heard shouting youre trash at Jones from a distance. Jones quickly turned around to find the heckler and yelled come here, coward.\n\nAfter catching up with the man, Jones pointed at the camera and said, Tell people intellectually who you are.\n\nIm your momma, the man, later identified as Seattle resident Jake Stratton, replied. He then proceeded to pour his coffee on Jones and backed away, laughing at him, and said, Ive got to get to work, where they have more coffee.\n\nThis is the brainwashing, you see, and Im proud of this, Jones said, looking into the camera. Because this is who they are . . . Thats why theyre allied with jihadis because they hate the West so much. The coffee incident quickly went viral on Twitter and some have even questioned the validity of it, and claim  with not a hint of irony  that it could have been staged. After the incident, Seattle Police tweeted that there were no official reports. As far as we know that could be an actor playing Alex Jones.\n\nWe haven't received any official reports. As far as we know that could be an actor playing Alex Jones.  Seattle Police Department (@SeattlePD) August 18, 2017\n\nReal or fake coffee attack, Jones continued with his broadcast, grabbing the attention of a man on a bicycle who told Jones, I dont talk to racist fucks.\n\nThere ya go, Jones said. They cannot even talk.\n\nWatch the full video for yourself, below."

        "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  Irans president on Wednesday reportedly ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after American airstrikes hit its most-important nuclear facilities.\n\nState media online reported the decision by President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nIt follows a law passed by Irans parliament to suspend that cooperation. It also already received the OK of a constitutional watchdog as well.\n\nIt wasnt immediately clear what that would mean for the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian Ahmed Jalil / Pool via AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe Vienna-based IAEA long has monitored Irans nuclear program. The agency didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the laws passage, Irans Supreme National Security Council was to oversee the bill and implementation. While the council itself hasnt said anything publicly, Pezeshkian is the head of the council, so his reported order signals that the bill would be implemented.\n\nHowever, under Irans theocractic government, there is room for the council to implement the bill as they see fit. That means that everything lawmakers asked for might not be done.\n\nIrans 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, negotiated under then U.S. President Barack Obama, allowed Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67%  enough to fuel a nuclear power plant, but far below the threshold of 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. It also drastically reduced Irans stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges and relied on the IAEA to oversee Tehrans compliance through additional oversight.\n\nBut U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first term in 2018, unilaterally withdrew Washington from the accord, insisting it wasnt tough enough and didnt address Irans missile program or its support for militant groups in the wider Middle East. That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.\n\nIran had been enriching up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003."

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump might look to take a victory lap on Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran, hailed by both as an unmitigated success.\n\nBut as they meet for the third time this year, the outwardly triumphant visit will be dogged by Israels 21-month war against Hamas in Gaza and questions over how hard Mr. Trump will push for an end to the conflict.\n\nMr. Trump has made clear that following the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon. The meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu could give new urgency to a U.S. ceasefire proposal being discussed by Israel and Hamas, but whether it leads to a deal that ends the war is unclear.\n\nThe optics will be very positive, said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. But behind the victory lap are going to be some very serious questions.\n\nBefore departing for Washington on July 6, Mr. Netanyahu praised the cooperation with the U.S. for bringing a huge victory over our shared enemy. He struck a positive note on a ceasefire for Gaza, saying he was working to achieve the deal under discussion, on the terms we agreed to.\n\nI think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for, Mr. Netanyahu said.\n\nIt changes from day to day\n\nIsrael and Hamas appear to be inching toward a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza, and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory.\n\nBut a perennial sticking point is whether the ceasefire will end the war altogether. Hamas has said it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu says the war will end once Hamas surrenders, disarms, and goes into exile  something it refuses to do.\n\nMr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to be known as a peacemaker. He has repeatedly trumpeted recent peace deals that his administration facilitated between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and Israel and Iran, and for years has made little secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHe has been pressuring Israel and Hamas to wrap up their own conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, ravaged Gaza, deepened Israels international isolation, and made any resolution to the broader conflict between Israel and the Palestinians more distant than ever.\n\nBut the precise details of the deal, and whether it can lead to an end to the war, are still in flux. In the days before Mr. Netanyahus visit, Mr. Trump seemed to downplay the chances for a breakthrough.\n\nAsked on July 4 how confident he was that a ceasefire deal would come together, Mr. Trump told reporters: Im very optimistic  but you know, look, it changes from day to day.\n\nOn Sunday evening, he seemed to narrow his expectations, telling reporters that he thought an agreement regarding the remaining hostages would be reached in the coming week.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu are more in sync than ever\n\nThose mood swings also have embodied Mr. Trumps relationship with Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nAfter Mr. Trumps decision to get involved in Israels war with Iran with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the two leaders are more in sync than ever. But that hasnt always been the case.\n\nAs recently as Mr. Netanyahus last visit to Washington in April, the tone was markedly different.\n\nMr. Trump used the photo-op with Mr. Netanyahu to announce that the U.S. was entering into negotiations with Iran over its nuclear deal  appearing to catch the Israeli leader off guard and at the time, slamming the brakes on any Israeli military plan.\n\nHe also praised Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a fierce critic of Israel, in front of Mr. Netanyahu, and the two made no apparent progress on a trade deal at the height of Mr. Trumps tariff expansion.\n\nMr. Trump, whose policies have largely aligned with Israels priorities, pledged last week to be very firm with Mr. Netanyahu on ending the war without saying what that would entail. Pressure from Mr. Trump has worked on Mr. Netanyahu in the past, with a ceasefire deal having been reached right as the president was taking office again.\n\nMr. Netanyahu has to balance the demands of his American ally with the far-right parties in his governing coalition, who hold the key to his political survival and oppose ending the war.\n\nBut given the strong U.S. support in Israels war against Iran, highlighted by joint airstrikes on a fortified underground Iranian nuclear site, Mr. Netanyahu may have a tough time saying no.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Mr. Trump said one of the matters he expected to discuss with Mr. Netanyahu is probably a permanent deal with Iran.\n\nMr. Trump may also expect something in return for his recent calls for Mr. Netanyahus corruption trial to be canceled, which is a significant interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state.\n\nMr. Trump thinks that Mr. Netanyahu owes him, said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel affairs at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. And if Mr. Trump thinks that he needs to end the war in Gaza, then that is what he will need to do.\n\nTrumps regional vision\n\nThe two men will likely discuss the ceasefire with Iran and how to respond to any perceived violations.\n\nBut beyond Iran is Mr. Trumps grand vision for a new Middle East, where he hopes that additional countries will join the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel brokered during Mr. Trumps first term.\n\nMr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump are likely to discuss how to bring Syria into the fold. The country, a longtime enemy of Israel, has new leadership after the fall of President Bashar Assad, and experts say conditions might be ripe for some kind of nonbelligerency agreement.\n\nBut Mr. Trumps ultimate goal is to include regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudis, whose clout could open the door for other Arab or Muslim countries to join, have expressed interest in normalizing ties with Israel but only if it is accompanied by serious steps toward resolving Israels conflict with the Palestinians. For starters, that would seem to require action in Gaza.\n\nThe most important thing [for Mr. Trump] is to end the war in Gaza, Gilboa said. That is the key to all the regional peace in the Middle East.\n\nThis story was reported by the Associated Press."

        "content": "A generation of scientific talent is at the brink of being lost to overseas competitors by the Trump administrations dismantling of the National Science Foundation (NSF), with unprecedented political interference at the agency jeopardizing the future of US industries and economic growth, according to a Guardian investigation.\n\nThe gold standard peer-reviewed process used by the NSF to support cutting-edge, high-impact science is being undermined by the chaotic cuts to staff, programs and grants, and by meddling by the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge), according to multiple current and former NSF employees who spoke with the Guardian.\n\nThe scientists warn that Trumps assault on diversity in science is already eroding the quality of fundamental research funded at the NSF, the premier federal investor in basic science and engineering, which threatens to derail advances in tackling existential threats to food, water and biodiversity in the US.\n\nBefore Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, its like rolling the dice, because a Doge person has the final say, said one current program officer. There has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. Its disgusting what were being instructed to do.\n\nAnother program officer said: The exact details of the extra step is opaque but I can say with high confidence that people from Doge or its proxies are scrutinizing applications with absolutely devastating consequences. The move amounts to the US willingly conceding global supremacy to competitors like China in biological, social and physical sciences. It is a mind-boggling own goal.\n\nThe NSF, founded in 1950, is the only federal agency that funds fundamental research across all fields of science and engineering, and which over the years has contributed to major breakthroughs in organ transplants, gene technology, AI, smartphones and the internet, extreme weather and other hazard warning systems, American sign language, cybersecurity and even the language app Duolingo.\n\nIn normal times, much of the NSF budget ($9bn in 2024-25) is allocated to research institutions after projects undergo a rigorous three-step review process  beginning with the program officer, an expert in the field, who ensures the proposed study fits in with the agencys priorities. The program officer convenes an expert panel to evaluate the proposal on two statutory criteria  intellectual merit and broader impacts on the nation and people  which under the NSFs legal mandate includes broadening participation of individuals, institutions, and geographic regions in Stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields.\n\nThe NSFs gold standard review process has 100% been compromised Current NSF program officer\n\nApplications from across the country which are greenlighted by the program officer are almost always funded, though may be subject to tweaks after revision by the division director before the grants directorate allocates the budget.\n\nThat was before Trump. Now, Doge personnel can veto any study  without explanation, the Guardian has confirmed.\n\nWe are under pressure to only fund proposals that fit the new narrow priorities even if they did not review as well as others, said one current program officer. The NSFs gold standard review process has 100% been compromised.\n\nResearch aimed at addressing the unequal impact of the climate crisis and other environmental hazards is particularly vulnerable, according to several sources. New proposals are also being screened for any direct reference or indirect connection to diversity, equity or inclusion (DEI).\n\nNSF is being asked to make science racist again  which contradicts evidence that shows that diversity of ideas is good for science and good for innovation. We are missing things when only white males do science, said one program officer.\n\nIn addition to Doge interfering in new proposals, at least 1,653 active NSF research grants authorized on their merits have so far been abruptly cancelled  abandoned midway through the project, according to Grant Watch, a non-profit tracker of federal science and health research grants canceled under Trump.\n\nMultiple NSF scientists who oversee a diverse range of NSF programs described the grant cancellations as unprecedented, arbitrary and a colossal waste of taxpayer money.\n\nAlmost 60% of the projects abandoned are in states which voted for Joe Biden in 2024, Guardian analysis found. Meanwhile more than one in nine cancelled grants  12% of the total  were at Harvard University, which Trump has particularly targeted since coming to power in January.\n\nIn addition, studies deemed to be violating Trumps executive orders on DEI and environmental justice  regardless of their scientific merit, potential impact or urgency  are being abruptly terminated at particularly high rates.\n\nIts not uncommon for the NSF and other federal research agencies to shift focus to reflect a new administrations priorities. Amid mounting evidence on the crucial role of diversity in innovation and science, Biden priorities included increased effort to tackle inequalities across the Stem workforce  and a commitment to target underserved communities most affected by the climate crisis and environmental harms.\n\nTrumps priorities are AI, quantum information science, nuclear, biotech and translational research.\n\nIt has been soul-sucking to see projects that went through the review process being changed or terminated over and over again Current NSF staffer\n\nIts normal that a new administration will emphasize some areas, de-emphasize others, and we would gradually transition to new priorities. During the George W Bush administration there were shenanigans around climate change, but it was nothing like this kind of meddling in the scientific review process. You never just throw proposals in the garbage can, said one current NSF staffer.\n\nOur mandate is to advance science and innovation. And we just cant do that if were not thinking about diversifying the Stem workforce. We dont have enough people or diversity of thought without broadening participation  which is part of the NSF mission mandate, said a former program officer from the Directorate for Computer and Information Science who recently accepted a buyout.\n\nIt has been soul-sucking to see projects that went through the review process being changed or terminated over and over again, they added.\n\nThe Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.\n\nTrumps big, beautiful bill calls for a 56% cut to the current $9bn NSF budget, as well as a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships  with graduate students among the hardest hit.\n\nLast week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud) announced that it will be moving into the NSF headquarters in Virginia over the course of the next two years. The shock announcement  which did not include any plans on relocating more than 1,800 NSF employees  has triggered speculation that the administration eventually plans to defund the agency entirely.\n\nView image in fullscreen The National Science Foundation headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, last month. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nFor now, program officers are also being instructed to return research proposals to scientists and institutions without review  regardless of merit and despite having been submitted in response to specific NSF solicitations to address gaps in scientific and engineering knowledge around some of the most pressing concerns in the US. This includes projects that have in fact undergone review, and others which can no longer be processed due to staff and program cuts, according to multiple NSF sources.\n\nIn one case, a 256-page proposal by scientists at four public universities to use ancient DNA records to better forecast biodiversity loss as the planet warms was apparently archived without consideration.\n\nIn an email seen by the Guardian, the NSF told Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist and principal investigator (lead scientist) based at the University of Maine, that all proposals submitted to the Biology Integration Institute program were returned without review. A second email said their specific proposal had been administratively screened and the area of proposed study was inappropriate for NSF funding.\n\nAn estimated 40% of animals and 34% of plants across the US are currently at risk. The proposed study would have used an emerging technology to extract ancient DNA from lake sediments, ice cores and cave deposits to better understand which species fared better or worse when the planet naturally warmed thousands of years ago  in order to help model and protect biodiversity in the face of human-made climate change.\n\nGill told the Guardian the team took great care to avoid any reference to DEI or climate change. The grant would have created much-needed research capacity in the US, which is lagging behind Europe in this field.\n\nAncient DNA records allow you to reconstruct entire ecosystems at a very high level. This is a very new and emerging science, and grants like this help catalyze the research and reinvest in US infrastructure and workforce in ways that have huge returns on investments for their local economies. Its an absolute slap in the face that the proposal was returned without review, Gill said.\n\nNothings going to get funded because theres DEI in this program NSF employee\n\nIn another example, two academic institutions chosen to receive prestigious $15m grants for translational research  a Trump priority  after a 30-month cross-agency review process led by the engineering directorate and involving hundreds of people will not be honored.\n\nThe proposals selected for the award through merit review will be returned without review for being inappropriate for NSF funding, the Guardian understands.\n\nThis is complex, very high-impact translation science to achieve sustainability across cities and regions and industries  were being instructed to put the principal investigators off, but nothings going to get funded because theres DEI in this program, said an NSF employee with knowledge of the situation.\n\nMeanwhile scores of other proposals approved on merit by program officers are disappearing into a black box  languishing for weeks or months without a decision or explanation, which was leading some to self-censor, according to NSF staff.\n\nIts either NSF staff self-censoring to make sure they dont get into trouble, or it is censorship by somebody inserted in the scientific review process from Doge. Either way its a political step, and therefore problematic, said Anne Marie Schmoltner, a program officer in the chemistry division who retired in February after 30 years in the agency.\n\nIn addition to distributing funds to seasoned researchers, the NSF supports students and up-and-coming scientists and engineers through fellowships, research opportunities and grants.\n\nView image in fullscreen Scientists view images of deep space captured by the Vera Rubin Observatory, funded by the National Science Foundation, in Chile, last month. Photograph: Rodrigo Arangua/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis next generation of talent is being hit particularly hard under Trump, who is attempting to impose sweeping restrictions on visas and travel bans on scores of countries. The proposed 2026 budget includes funding for only 21,400 under- and postgraduate students nationwide  a 75% fall on this year.\n\nLike many scientists across the country, Gill, the paleoecologist, is not accepting new graduate students this fall due to funding uncertainty. Thats a whole generation of young scientists who see no pathway into the field for them. I cannot stress enough how deeply upsetting and demoralizing these cuts are to a community of people who only ever wanted to solve problems and be of use.\n\nYet the NSF student pipeline provides experts for the oil and gas, mining, chemical, big tech and other industries which support Trump, in addition to academic and government-funded agencies.\n\nIndustry is working on optimizing what theyre doing right now, whereas NSF is looking 10, 20 years down the road. The US wants a global, robust economy and for that you need innovation, and for innovation you need the fundamental research funded by the NSF, said Schmoltner.\n\nThe NSF declined to comment, referring instead to the agency website last updated in April which states: The principles of merit, competition, equal opportunity and excellence are the bedrock of the NSF mission. NSF continues to review all projects using Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts criteria.\n\nThe sweeping cuts to the NSF come on top of Trumps dismantling of other key scientific research departments within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Geological Service (USGS).\n\nThe USGS is the research arm of the Department of Interior. Its scientists help solve real-life problems about hazards, natural resources, water, energy, ecosystems, and the impacts of climate and land-use change for tribal governments, the Bureau of Land Management, fish and wildlife services, and the National Parks Service among other interior agencies.\n\nTrumps big, beautiful bill cuts the USGS budget by 39%. This includes slashing the entire budget for the agencys ecosystems mission area (EMA), which leads federal research on species & ecosystems and houses the climate adaptation science centers.\n\nEMA scientists figure out how to better protect at-risk species such as bees and wolverines, minimize harmful overgrazing on BLM lands, and prevent invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes  all vitally important to protect food security in the US as the climate changes.\n\nThe EMA has already lost 25 to 30% of employees through Doge-approved layoffs and buyouts, and is now facing termination. Weve already lost a lot of institutional memory and new, up-and-coming leaders. [If Trumps budget is approved], all science in support of managing our public lands and natural resources would be cut, said one USGS program officer.\n\nThis is now a political process USGS scientist\n\nOur economy is driven by natural resources including timber, minerals and food systems, and if we dont manage these in a sustainable way, we will be shooting ourselves in the foot.\n\nLike at the NSF, the USGCs gold standard peer-review system for research approval and oversight is now at the mercy of Doge  in this case Tyler Hasson, the former oil executive given sweeping authority by the interior secretary. According to USGS staff, Hassons office accepts or rejects proposals based on two paragraphs of information program officers are permitted to submit  without any dialogue or feedback.\n\nThe gold standard scientific review is being interfered with. This is now a political process, said one USGS scientist.\n\nA spokesperson for the interior department said: The claim that science is being politicized is categorically false. We reject the narrative that responsible budget reform constitutes an assault on science. On the contrary, we are empowering American innovation by cutting red tape, reducing bureaucracy and ensuring that the next generation of scientists and engineers can focus on real-world solutions  not endless paperwork or politically motivated research agendas.\n\nThe USGS, office of management and budget and White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Guardian is interested in hearing from US scientists and students impacted by the changes at National Science Foundation and other agencies, including on the impact on innovation in the US.

        "content": "Rescue crews continued on Tuesday to comb through parts of the Texas Hill Country devastated by catastrophic flash flooding over the Fourth of July weekend, but with more than 100 dead and hope fading for survivors, efforts have increasingly turned to search and recovery.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the death toll across the six affected counties surpassed 100. Most of the deaths were in Kerr county, where officials said 87 bodies had so far been recovered, including 56 adults and 30 children. Identification was pending for 19 adults and seven children with one additional person still unidentified, county sheriff Larry Leitha told a news conference.\n\nAt Camp Mystic, five campers and one counsellor remained unaccounted for, Leitha said. The Christian girls summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River is at the centre of the flood-ravaged region, and at least 27 campers and counselors are known to have died.\n\nFour days after the last person was found alive in the aftermath of the floods, the hope of finding survivors was increasingly bleak.\n\nAt the press conference, authorities leading the search for victims seemed to dodge questions over who was responsible for monitoring the weather that killed so many people and warning that flash floods were hurtling toward camps and homes.\n\nThe timeline of the official response remains unclear. Despite the fact that the National Weather Services first public warning alert for life-threatening flash flooding came at 1.14am on 4 July, Leitha told reporters he was not made aware of the flash floods until between 4 and 5 that morning.\n\nThroughout the periodically heated press conference, he and other Texas officials faced accusations of ducking questions regarding Kerr countys alert system. They repeatedly insisted that their priority was finding victims, not reviewing what happened in the hours before the floods devastated the region.\n\nResponding to a question about the alerts, Leitha said: As Ive told you several times, that is not my priority this time. There are three priorities, thats locating the people out there, identifying, notifying the next of kin  that is what Im taking as my job as sheriff.\n\nAsked whether the emergency manager was awake at the time to issue an emergency alert, the sheriff said: I cant tell you at this time. When a reporter pressed him on a response, Leitha said: Its not that easy as you just push a button, OK, theres a lot more to that, and weve told you several times, he said.\n\nReporters continued to ask about the countys alert system, but officials evaded the questions to focus on recovery efforts.\n\nWe understand you have many questions. We understand that. But right now, this team up here is focused on bringing people home, Lt Col Ben Baker of the Texas Game Wardens said. Thats our focus."

        "content": "The United States only has about 25% of the Patriot missile interceptors it needs for all of the Pentagons military plans after burning through stockpiles in the Middle East in recent months, an alarming depletion that led to the Trump administration freezing the latest transfer of munitions to Ukraine.\n\nThe stockpile of the Patriot missiles has fallen so low that it raised concern inside the Pentagon that it could jeopardize potential US military operations, and deputy defense secretary, Stephen Feinberg, authorized the transfer to be halted while they reviewed where weapons were being sent.\n\nDonald Trump appeared to reverse at least part of that decision on Monday when he told reporters in advance of a dinner at the White House with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would send some more weapons to Ukraine, although he did not disclose whether that would include Patriot systems.\n\nTrump also told Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a phone call that he was not responsible for the halt in weapons shipments and that he had directed a review of US weapons stockpiles but didnt order the freeze, according to people briefed on the conversation.\n\nBut the determination last month to halt the transfer, as described by four people directly familiar with the matter, was based in large part on the Pentagons global munitions tracker, which is used to generate the minimum level of munitions required to carry out the US militarys operations plans.\n\nAccording to the tracker, which is managed by the joint chiefs of staff and the Pentagons defense security cooperation agency, the stockpiles of a number of critical munitions have been below that floor for several years since the Biden administration started sending military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe Trump administration started a review of the depleted level of Patriot missiles and other munitions around February, the people said. Deliberations accelerated after the US deployed more of the interceptors in the Middle East to support the Houthi campaign and to Israel.\n\nThe situation also became more acute following Trumps move to bomb Irans nuclear facilities last month, the people said, when the US fired close to 30 Patriot missiles to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles fired in performative retaliation at the Al Udeid base in Qatar.\n\nThe recent depletion of Patriot missiles and other munitions formed part of the basis of a recommendation memo by Elbridge Colby, the under secretary of defense for policy, that outlined several options to conserve weapons and sent to Feinbergs office.\n\nEarlier reports said Colby, who has drawn criticism from Democrats for prioritizing shifting resources from the Ukraine conflict in preparation for a potential war with China, had paused the transfer but two of the people said the undersecretarys office lacks the power to make such a unilateral move.\n\nThe decision was rather made by Feinberg, the former chief executive or Cerberus Capital Management to whom Colby reports, the people said. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth then signed off on Feinbergs determination.\n\nBut the abrupt pause has come at a critical time for Ukraine, as Russia last week launched its largest aerial offensive to date and Ukraine has limited options to acquire both precision-guided and more basic weapons to hold off increasingly intense Russian attacks.\n\nUkraine is also largely unable to directly buy weapons from defense contractors for its purposes, since a new order is estimated to take years to fulfill, and it would only be completed after the Pentagon had its own orders completed since the defense department is a higher priority customer.\n\nTrumps decision to reverse course and allow some defensive munitions to be sent to Ukraine appears to have come amid growing frustration with Russian president Vladimir Putin, who he criticized on Monday for not helping end the war.\n\nSpokespeople for the White House and the Pentagon confirmed some transfers would resume at Trumps direction but did not specify whether the weapons being sent to Ukraine would involve munitions at critically low levels.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

President Trump wants to stop the killing and has pledged to provide Ukraine with additional defensive munitions, said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly.\n\nWhile Trump has publicly complained about Ukraine aid in financial terms, Feinberg was briefed that the larger problem has been with the ability for the US to manufacture the weapons to quickly backfill the depleted stockpiles, two of the people said.\n\nThe US has been transferring weapons to Ukraine using two principal channels: through a drawdown of defense department stockpiles, and through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), where the defense department pays contractors to manufacture weapons to go to Ukraine.\n\nBoth transfer mechanisms was set to have been affected by the freeze, the people said, since the Pentagon is prioritizing replenishing its stockpiles using the same defense contractors being relied upon to build weapons for Ukraine through the USAI program.\n\nFor the latest weapons shipment to Ukraine, the US had earmarked dozens of Patriot missiles among other munitions including air-to-air Sparrow missiles, Hellfire missiles, GMLRS rocket artillery and anti-tank guns.\n\nThe principal concern appears to revolve around the Patriot missiles, which the US produces 600 per year but Iran alone has more than 1,000 ballistic missiles remaining it could theoretically use against US bases in the region if the ceasefire with Israel were to break down.\n\nThe US has also transferred around 2,000 Stinger missiles to Ukraine, which officials estimated to be equivalent to two-and-a-half years of production, and is increasingly used by the US military for its own defense purposes against hostile drones, the people said."

        "content": "Whether the United States launches a broader war against Iran after bombing its nuclear facilities may come down to President Trumps meetings at NATOs Netherlands summit this week, a long scheduled gathering that now carries far higher stakes.\n\nTrump said late Monday on his social media platform that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire that would quickly lead to a conclusion of the war. On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, THE 12 DAY WAR, he wrote.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Iran or Israel.\n\nWashingtons transatlantic partners have praised the U.S. operation, which supplemented an ongoing Israeli campaign targeting Irans nuclear infrastructure, air defenses and military leadership. But European officials told The Times their hope is to pull Trump back from any flirtation with a change of government in Iran, a prospect that Trump and Israels prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, have openly discussed in recent days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is scheduled to arrive in The Hague on Tuesday morning for two days of meetings, now expected to focus on the nascent crisis, as U.S. intelligence and military officials continue to assess the outcome of the American strikes over the weekend against Irans main nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was directly involved in the last two U.S. wars in the Middle East, taking part in a U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and helping to train and advise security forces in Iraq. And although not a member of NATO, Israel coordinates with the security bloc through a process called the Mediterranean Dialogue, which includes work against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAt the Mauritshuis on Monday evening, overlooking The Hagues historic court pond and under the gaze of Vermeers Girl With a Pearl Earring, NATO officials, European military leaders and U.S. senators discussed the obvious: A summit that had been seen as an opportunity to show Trump that Europe is willing to pay more for its defense  with NATO members now committing to spend 5% of their gross domestic product on military essentials and expenditures  will now be consumed instead with the possibility of a new war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the event was ending, Iran struck the U.S. military base in Qatar, its largest in the Middle East. But the Iranians gave Doha advance notice of the strike in an effort to avert casualties, indicating Tehran might be looking for an off-ramp from continuing escalation with Washington.\n\nIran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, Trump wrote on social media after the attack. Most importantly, theyve gotten it all out of their system, and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE.\n\nI want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured, he added. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the Pentagon said the U.S. bombing run, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, severely damaged Irans nuclear infrastructure, American and Israeli officials acknowledged to The Times that it is not entirely clear how much equipment and fissile material Tehran was able to salvage before the attacks began.\n\nAnd as concerns emerge that Iran may have been able to preserve a breakout capability, Israels target list across Iran seemed to broaden on Monday to reflect military ambitions beyond Irans nuclear program, including the headquarters of the Basij militia and a clock in downtown Tehran counting down to Israels destruction.\n\nTrump spoke too soon, said Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official and Iran expert at the American Enterprise Institute, of the presidents declaration that the United States had obliterated Irans nuclear capacity with its weekend strikes.\n\nWe may have simply waited too long with our hand-wringing, and given the Iranians time to evacuate their enriched stockpiles. If so, that represents a failure of leadership, he added, noting reports that trucks could be seen at the Fordo site leading up to the U.S. attack. If they then scattered and the U.S. intelligence community lost track of where they went, then that is an intelligence failure that could potentially be as costly as the one that preceded the Iraq war.\n\nEuropean powers, particularly France, Germany and the United Kingdom, have been careful to praise Trump for ordering the strikes. But they have also urged an immediate return to negotiations and expressed concern that Israel has begun targeting sites tangential and unrelated to Irans nuclear program.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, warning of volatility in the region, encouraged Iran to return to the negotiating table and reach a diplomatic solution to end this crisis. And Germanys foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, questioned whether Tehrans nuclear knowledge could be bombed away. No one thinks its a good thing to keep fighting, he told local media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI called for de-escalation and for Iran to exercise the utmost restraint in this dangerous context, to allow a return to diplomacy, said French President Emmanuel Macron. Engaging in dialogue and securing a clear commitment from Iran to renounce nuclear weapons are essential to avoid the worst for the entire region. There is no alternative.\n\nLater Monday, after Israel had struck Irans notorious Evin prison, where foreign nationals are held, Frances foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, issued a more scathing rebuke. All strikes must now stop, he said.\n\nOne European official said that efforts would be made once Trump arrives to underscore his military successes, noting the example he has set  using military force to deter an authoritarian foe  could still be applied to Russia in its war against Ukraine. Now that Trump has demonstrated peace through strength, the official said, it is time to give diplomacy another chance.\n\nBut its unclear whether Iran would be receptive to pleas for a diplomatic breakthrough.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, Irans foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, noted that Israels attacks last week and the U.S. strikes this week coincided with negotiations, torpedoing any chance for talks to succeed.\n\nLast week, we were in negotiations with the U.S. when Israel decided to blow up that diplomacy. This week, we held talks with the E3/E.U. when the U.S. decided to blow up that diplomacy, he wrote, adding that European calls to bring Iran to negotiations were misplaced. The E3 consists of France, Germany and Italy.\n\nHow can Iran return to something it never left, let alone blew up? he added.\n\nOn Monday, before its strikes against the U.S. base in Qatar, Iranian military leaders vowed vengeance against the United States for the strikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe retaliation will impose severe, regret-inducing, and unpredictable consequences on you, said Lt. Col. Ebrahim Zolfaqari, head of the Iranian militarys central command headquarters, in a video statement on Iranian broadcaster Press TV. He added that the U.S. attack will expand the range of legitimate and diverse targets for Irans armed forces.\n\nTimes staff writer Nabih Bulos in Beirut contributed to this report."

        "content": "Its not uncommon to see developments named after what they displace or sometimes destroy. Subdivisions with names like Wild Creek Place likely contain neither a trace of the wild nor the remains of a creek. I guess more descriptive names such as Flat Asphalt Junction simply lack the same level of appeal.\n\nIve come to see the names of Kansas legislative committees in the same manner. Under the legislatures ultraconservative leadership, committees such as Education (House and Senate), Education Budget (House), Commerce, Labor and Economic Development (House) and Local Government (Senate), to name but a few, seem cruelly named after what the ultraconservatives have marked for displacement or destruction.\n\nGov. Sam Brownbacks march to zero income taxes, combined with legislation designed to weaken public services and wrest control away from local government, are hollowing out the very aspects of government these committees focus on. Public education certainly seems targeted to be greatly supplemented by, if not outright replaced by, private education.\n\nWe see this in other states as well. For some time now, model legislation from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), Americans For Prosperity (AFP) and other libertarian / ultraconservative organizations has been used as the template for bills in states with varying levels of ultraconservative control. Such templates have been developed on everything from taxation and fiscal policy, to energy and the environment, to health and human services.\n\nLooking just at education, in 2015 there were 172 measures introduced in 42 states based on ALEC model legislation, according to the Center for Media and Democracy. The general goal being to  transform public education from a public and accountable institution that serves the public into one that serves private, for-profit interests. With public education commonly comprising a significant portion of state budgets, this dovetails nicely with ultraconservative legislation focused on drastically shrinking government and reducing taxes.\n\nIn Kansas, one of the latest bills taking inspiration from such model legislation is HB 2741, intended to provide the state with a new public school funding formula. The Kansas Association of School Boards (KASB) provides a good summary of the bill here. The need for a new formula began during the 2014-2015 legislative session with the repeal of the previous school funding formula and implementation of the temporary two-year block grant funding mechanism, intended to fill the gap while the legislature works on a new formula. I should note that the block grant has also effectively reduced the dollars available to school districts for day to day operations.\n\nHB 2741 was filed shortly before the legislative break and now sits in the House Appropriations Committee. One of the more controversial things the bill does is establish the Kansas Education Freedom Act, creating a private school savings program and essentially diverting already limited public school dollars to private schools. It would allow parents to use 70 percent of the state aid per student for their district to pay for private (including religious) schools, online schools, home schooling or tutors.\n\nWhile the bill would require such students be provided instruction in at least those subjects required by state law it does not require any type of student assessment or accountability measures. And the Kansas state treasurer, not the Kansas State Department of Education, would be given regulatory oversight of both the finances and the academics related to the private school savings program.\n\nThese education freedom accounts as described in the bill bear a lot of similarity to aspects of ALECs Education Savings Account Act model legislation. For example, giving oversight to the state treasurer follows ALECs suggestion that financial and academic oversight do not have to fall under a states department in charge of education. The model legislation defines this oversight department as the state Department of Public Instruction or an organization chosen by the state [italics added].\n\nThe stated purpose of HB 2747 is to provide financing of instruction. However, the bill limits instruction to  those school district functions that directly impact the provision of education services. The term instruction does not include the following school district functions: Central office administration; capital improvement construction, reconstruction or remodeling; facility maintenance and repair; food service procurement and preparation; or the provision of extracurricular activities \n\nWhile general state aid to instruction activities is increased under this bill, it is decreased or eliminated relative to the non-instruction functions specifically mentioned above. And though analysis by KASB suggests HB 2747 would initially be a 4% increase in state general aid over the block grant (still inadequate and not more than the previous funding formula), after the Hold Harmless dollars go away two years later it would actually be a decrease. This provides the ultraconservatives an opportunity to argue that theyve increased instructional funding (important in an election year) while still reducing the states overall spending on public education (necessary if theyre going to continue this mad march to zero income taxes).\n\nAnd reducing overall spending on public education is a primary goal of ALEC and AFP, as well as the Kansas Policy Institute (KPI), Kansass local manifestation of this libertarian / ultraconservative intellectual tradition. Narrowly defining instruction and shifting dollars to the classroom are code for reducing the overall funding for day to day public school operations and have been common talking points of Brownback and the ultraconservative legislators.\n\nPer the bill, spending on administration would be reduced, which is already underfunded. General state aid could no longer be used to fund extracurricular activities (only local dollars), defined as those activities provided or supported by a school district, but which are not required by or a substantial part of any curriculum of such school district. Athletics would certainly take a hit, but so could other activities such as band, choir, debate, student council or anything else with an extracurricular component, limiting or eliminating the positive impacts such activities can have on students.\n\nAs with extracurricular activities, only local dollars could be used for food service or related activities, potentially impacting the quality and quantity of the food districts serve. But nutritional meals, along with having (and expecting to have) a full belly, actually impact the effectiveness of learning in the classroom. The elimination of general state aid funding for food service would also likely jeopardize local farm to school programs where theyve been implemented, not just negatively impacting students but also local economies.\n\nThe additional restrictions placed on capital improvement projects via a) the creation of the Joint Committee on State Building Construction to review (and limit) projects requesting capital improvement state aid, b) the reduction and in some cases elimination of state aid for non-classroom designated areas and c) the requirement of three sealed bids for any construction project making use of bond money (potentially problematic for rural areas and other special circumstances), would have a negative impact on students as well as local economies. By reducing state spending on capital improvement projects, the burden for this would further be shifted to local communities and the number and quality of projects would likely decrease.\n\nA recent report from the USGBCs Center for Green Schools, summarized here, concluded that current spending levels are already inadequate to meet modern standards and district needs relative to operations and maintenance, renovations and new construction. We still have a long way to go to recover from decades of deferred maintenance that can negatively impact student & teacher productivity/performance and health, and therefore student success. This bill would further slow that recovery in the state of Kansas.\n\nIncreasing the percentage of public education funding that local communities would have to provide also flies in the face of the recent Kansas Supreme Court ruling in favor of a lower courts decision that the current block grant doesnt equitably fund all school districts. Wealthier districts have greater potential to raise local funds for these non-instructional functions. So HB 2741 would seem no closer to meeting this equity requirement than the block grant.\n\nInterestingly Representative Ron Highland, Republican, one of two primary authors of the bill (the other being Senator Steve Abrams, Republican), stated that HB 2741 incorporates recommendations from a $2.6 million efficiency study conducted by consulting firm Alvarez and Marsal. Thats $2.6 million spent on a study geared to reduce government spending; $2.6 million spent by a state with significant revenue problems originating from a reliance on outdated and disproven economic policies that lead to the revenue problems to begin with. Problems that could have been essentially solved by simply repealing the governors devastating income tax cuts.\n\nWhile some of the bill does derive from the studys recommendations, none of the specific aspects Ive covered here  shifting public dollars to private schools and limiting state dollars to a narrow definition of instruction related activities  are actually in Alvarez and Marsals recommendations (at least that I could find). But they are a reflection of the libertarian and ultraconservative ideologies that underlie ALEC, AFP and KPI. While I dont believe that Rep. Highland and Sen. Abrams are currently members of ALEC (though many Kansas legislators are), they have previously attended ALEC events and are sympathetic to the public education gutting agendas of ALEC, AFP and KPI.\n\nIts been increasingly bleak in Kansas since Brownback was elected in 2010. But Kansans are starting to wake up. Grassroots organizations like Game On for Kansas Schools, Women for Kansas, Moderate Party of Kansas, Mainstream Coalition and others are getting their message out across the state, and people are listening. More and more Kansans are stepping forward to challenge these ultraconservative legislators in the primary and general elections. Im hopeful that after the fall elections, Kansass legislative landscape will have changed enough to halt progress on the ultraconservative agendas; maybe, dare I say, even form a veto-proof coalition on certain issues. Im also hopeful that our legislative committee names will no longer have to serve as memorials to whats being displaced or destroyed.\n\nAnd by the way, HB 2741 is named Creating the school district finance and student success act. I guess the Breaking public education, increasing privatization, student success be damned act didnt have quite the desired ring to it. It would certainly have been more descriptive though."

He said: \"Welcome to the Miramax family. You know, come to premieres, screenings, et cetera. In fact, there's one this afternoon. Would you like to come?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Sure.\"\n\nAnd I ended up going to see a movie with him. It ended up just being a movie, not a screening, but the film \"Red Rock West.\" And, you know, that's right when I had this sort of sinking feeling that something wasn't going right.\n\nAnd then, after the movie, we walked for a few blocks. And he said he needed to go up to his apartment to get something, and would I just come with him real quick? And I sort of said no, and we went back and forth on that for a minute. It was sort of a negotiation with him always, trying to sort of stand my ground, but then be convinced it was OK.\n\nI did go into his apartment. Once there, we talked for a long time about art and movies. And I felt like he was treating me like an intellect.\n\nAnd I felt like the meeting was going really well, and sort of continued. I didn't feel unsafe once I was in there. And, at one point, then, he got up to go to the bathroom. And he came back in a robe and asked me to give him a massage.\n\nAnd I was extremely uncomfortable. And I was like, oh, God, no, I'm not comfortable with that. And we went back and forth on that.\n\nAnd then he went back to the bathroom again, and came back this time completely naked. And, you know, that changed it entirely for me, too. It just took it to the next place. It was completely disorienting. And I was scared, you know? I was really scared.\n\nAnd then it became sort of a cat-and-mouse game of, like, how am I going to get out of there?\n\nAnd I'm  it's hard to make sense of what someone is trying to do to you when they're fully naked, and they're"

        "content": "Michael Madsen, the gravel-voiced character actor best known for playing sneering tough guys in Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2,\" died Thursday morning from cardiac arrest, according to his manager, Ron Smith.\n\nHe was 67.\n\nIn an acting career spanning more than 40 years, Madsen racked up dozens of screen roles. But he was best known for his collaborations with Tarantino, who cast him as a psychotic thief in \"Reservoir Dogs\" and a washed-up hitman in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2.\"\n\n\"Reservoir Dogs,\" one of the seminal independent films of the 1990s, shocked audiences with its graphic violence, including a scene in which Madsen's character, Mr. Blonde, cuts off a police officer's ear while dancing to \"Stuck in the Middle With You.\"\n\nMichael Madsen attends an event in Santa Monica, California on April 21, 2014. Jerod Harris / Getty Images file\n\nMadsen's other notable big-screen credits include \"The Doors,\" \"Thelma & Louise,\" and \"Donnie Brasco.\" Tarantino included him in the ensemble casts of the bloody Western \"The Hateful Eight\" and the 1969-set \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"\n\nIn addition to film and television projects, Madsen played voice roles in video games such as \"Grand Theft Auto III,\" the \"Dishonored\" series, and \"Crime Boss: Rockay City.\" He also published poetry and photography.\n\nMichael Madsen was born in Chicago on Sept. 25, 1957, to a firefighter father and filmmaker mother; one of his siblings is the Oscar-nominated actor Virginia Madsen.\n\nHe got his professional start working at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, where he apprenticed under John Malkovich. The experience led to small early roles in 1980s films like \"WarGames\" and \"The Natural.\"\n\nMadsen eventually broke through with \"Reservoir Dogs,\" a low-budget crime thriller that launched Tarantino's career and helped transform the Sundance Film Festival into a Hollywood hotspot.\n\nThe film also earned Madsen an indelible place in film history. The sadistic and trigger-happy Mr. Blonde was one of the 400 nominees for the American Film Institute's list of the all-time greatest movie villains.\n\nRoger Ebert praised Madsen's performance in an otherwise mixed review of \"Reservoir Dogs.\"\n\n\"One of the discoveries in the movie is Madsen, who has done a lot of acting over the years ... but here emerges with the kind of really menacing screen presence only a few actors achieve; he can hold his own with the fearsome Tierney, and reminds me a little of a very mean Robert De Niro,\" Ebert wrote in his review.\n\nMadsen was originally lined up to play John Travolta's role in Tarantino's era-defining \"Pulp Fiction,\" though he dropped out to appear in Kevin Costner's \"Wyatt Earp\" instead  a choice he said he came to regret.\n\nTarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\" allowed Madsen to flex his dramatic muscles as Budd, a former elite assassin who eventually finds himself working as a low-rent bouncer and living in a trailer.\n\nHe worked steadily throughout his career, acting in various small-scale projects but occasionally appearing in high-profile releases, such as the James Bond franchise entry \"Die Another Day\" and the graphic novel adaptation \"Sin City.\"\n\nMadsen was married three times, most recently to DeAnna Morgan. He is survived by four children, including actor Christian Madsen; another son, Hudson, died in 2022."

        "content": "LONDON  French President Emmanuel Macron arrives in Britain on Tuesday for a state visit mixing royal pageantry with thorny political talks about stopping migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats.\n\nMacron and Prime Minister Keir Starmer will also try to advance plans for a post-ceasefire security force for Ukraine, despite apparent U.S. indifference to the idea and Russias refusal to halt the onslaught on its neighbor.\n\nMacrons three-day visit, at the invitation of King Charles III, is the first state visit to the U.K. by a European Union head of state since Brexit, and a symbol of the British governments desire to reset relations with the bloc that the U.K. acrimoniously left in 2020.\n\nThe president and his wife, Brigitte Macron, will be driven to Windsor Castle by horse-drawn carriage, greeted by a military honor guard and treated to a state banquet hosted by the king and Queen Camilla. The British royals made a state visit to France in September 2023.\n\nMacron also will address both houses of Britains Parliament in the buildings fabulously ornate Royal Gallery before sitting down for talks with Starmer on migration, defense and investment.\n\nAt a U.K.-France summit on Thursday, senior government officials from the two countries will discuss small-boat crossings, a thorny issue for successive governments on both sides of the channel.\n\nBritain receives fewer asylum-seekers than Mediterranean European countries, but thousands of migrants each year use northern France as a launching point to reach the U.K., either by stowing away in trucks or  after a clampdown on that route  in small boats across one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes.\n\nThe U.K. has struck a series of deals with France over the years to increase patrols of beaches and share intelligence in an attempt to disrupt the smuggling gangs.\n\nIt has all had only a limited impact. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel in small boats in 2024, the second-highest annual figure after 46,000 in 2022. More than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025, up by about 50% from the same period last year. Dozens of people have died attempting the crossing.\n\nStarmer, whose center-left government was elected a year ago, has pledged to  smash the gangs  behind organized people-smuggling. His plan rests on closer cooperation with France and with countries further up the migrants route from Africa and the Middle East. The U.K. also aims to strike deals with individual nations to take back failed asylum seekers.\n\nBritish officials have been pushing for French police to intervene more forcefully to stop the boats, and welcomed the sight of officers slashing rubber dinghies with knives in recent days.\n\nU.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the French are bringing in important new tactics to stop boats that are in the water.\n\nBritain also is pushing France to let officers intervene against boats in deeper waters, a change the government in Paris is considering. Campaigners for migrants rights and a police union warn that doing so could endanger both migrants and officers.\n\nStarmer spokesperson Tom Wells said some of the tactics being discussed are operationally and legally complex, but were working closely with the French.\n\nThe two leaders have worked closely together to rally support for Ukraine, though they have taken contrasting approaches to U.S. President Donald Trump, with Macron more willing to challenge the American president than the emollient Starmer.\n\nBritain and France have led efforts to form an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine to reinforce a future ceasefire with European troops and equipment and U.S. security guarantees.\n\nTrump has shown little enthusiasm for the idea, however, and a ceasefire remains elusive. British officials say the coalition of the willing idea is alive and well, with Macron and Starmer due to join an international videoconference on Thursday to discuss planning for the force.\n\nStarmer spoke with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday about the significant progress being made by military planners, the British leaders office said."

        "content": "The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that the ancient Tibetan Buddhist institution he leads will live on after he dies, putting an end to speculation that he would be the last person to hold the role as he plans to reincarnate.\n\nAs part of celebrations marking his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also signaled that China, which Tibetan activists accuse of suppressing their language, culture and religion, should stay out of the process of choosing his successor.\n\nI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue, said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after he fled Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.\n\nI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation, he said, referring to an organization he founded. No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\n\nTibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama sits for his teachings during the 'Degon Yarchos Chenmo 2017' (Buddhist Summer Council) at the Diskit monastery in the Nubra Valley in India's Ladakh region near the Chinese border on July 12, 2017. Money Sharma / AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnxiety is mounting over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, in which he is worshiped as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion. His succession plan is likely to have an impact on Tibetans opposed to Chinas tight control of the Himalayan autonomous region.\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the comments swiftly, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry saying the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\n\nThe succession must take place in mainland China and get approval from the central government, spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.\n\nThe Dalai Lama made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Titbetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.\n\nIts unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that the Chinese government could take advantage of a gap in leadership.\n\nI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession, Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.\n\nIdentified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he was temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.\n\nIn 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.\n\nSince the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years, the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.\n\nIn March, he said in a new book that his successor would be born in the free world outside China so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.\n\nThe Dalai Lama had said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.\n\nSince then, he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the unanimous response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.\n\nFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation, said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books, including the recent Voice for the Voiceless.\n\nThere is also concern that if they do not select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.\n\nSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama, Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nIn 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, six years after the previous one died. The boy was forcibly disappeared by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.\n\nChina then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the 6 million people in Tibet.\n\nThe Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.\n\nIf Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, Tibetans would not be surprised, Jinpa said. They would be disappointed and annoyed, but I dont think they would be surprised.\n\nThe Chinese government says that Tibet has prospered under its rule and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says that the Dalai Lama is a political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.\n\nChinas Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations that Beijing claims aim to protect the tradition and religious freedom.\n\nThe succession must take place in mainland China and get approval by the central government, Mao, the ministry spokesperson, said Wednesday."

Local officials in Kerr county, where 87 bodies have been found so far, said their priority was finding victims, not reviewing what happened in the hours before the floods inundated the states Hill Country. In total, at least 107 people have died. During a sometimes tense news conference, officials faced questions about quickly they responded and who was in charge. Right now, this team up here is focused on bringing people home, said Lt Col Ben Baker, of the Texas Game Wardens.\n\n\n\nHope of finding survivors was increasingly bleak. Four days have passed since anyone was found alive in the aftermath of the floods, officials said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe search efforts benefited from improving weather. The storms that battered the Hill Country for the past four days began to lighten up, although isolated pockets of heavy rain were still possible. Share Updated at 13.12 EDT\n\n1h ago 14.00 EDT Summary Rescue crews continued on Tuesday to comb through parts of the Texas Hill Country devastated by catastrophic flash flooding over the Fourth of July weekend, but with more than 100 dead and hope fading for survivors, efforts have increasingly turned to search and recovery. Heres where we stand as of 2pm ET today: Authorities have said at least 107 people have been killed in the flash flooding. In Kerr county , 87 bodies have been recovered as of Tuesday morning. At Camp Mystic , five campers and one counselor remain unaccounted for, officials said.\n\nThe homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, spoke about leading the federal response to the flooding disaster at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. She said her visit to Texas was very emotional. Noem said Texas is strong but also noted: We, as a federal government, dont manage these disasters. The state does. She added: Were cutting through the paperwork of the old Fema streamlining it, much like your vision of how Fema should operate.\n\nQuestions are mounting over the response to the devastating flooding and a press conference in Texas turned tense. Right now, this team up here is focused on bringing people home, said Lt Col Ben Baker , of the Texas game wardens.\n\nSheriff Larry Leitha told reporters that the county is working on a timeline of how it alerted residents about the flash floods. Responding to a question about the alerts, he said: As Ive told you several times, that is not my priority this time. There are three priorities, thats locating the people out there, identifying, notifying the next of kin  that is what Im taking as my job as sheriff.\n\nHope of finding survivors was dwindling. Four days have passed since anyone was found alive in the aftermath of the floods, officials said.\n\nA team of first responders from Mexico joined search efforts on Monday in central Texas. The team traveled from Acua , in the state of Coahuila , which borders Del Ro, Texas, and includes nine members from the civil protection and fire department of Ciudad Acua and four members from the Fundacin 911 organization.\n\nThere is a small chance of more storms and rain, but forecasters say the flood-ravaged Texas Hill Country should see a break in storms today. And as of early this morning, all flood watches have been dropped for Texas, but a few flood warnings remain in effect. Share Updated at 14.09 EDT\n\n2h ago 13.29 EDT A state legislator in Texas has told the New York Times about efforts to get funding for sirens that would blare warnings during flash flooding. As questions mount over the official response to the flooding, Wes Virdell  who represents Kerry county  said his office would get a bill under way to get funding to help implement these sirens. Virdell suggested more action was needed. If you had cell service there, or even a Starlink, he said, it would help warn people of future weather disasters. Share Updated at 13.34 EDT\n\n2h ago 13.18 EDT The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said first responders in Texas are still looking for a lot of little girls who remain missing after a devastating flood in Texas. Noem described the scene in Texas as Trump met with his cabinet at the White House on Tuesday. Noem visited Camp Mystic in Kerrville on Saturday after the catastrophic flood on Friday. Share Updated at 13.20 EDT\n\n2h ago 13.07 EDT A US coast guard rescue swimmer on his first rescue mission as well as teenage counselors who helped shepherd cold and wet young campers to safety have been credited with saving dozens of lives at a flood-ravaged Christian summer camp on the banks of Texass Guadalupe River. Their stories of heroism and fortitude  including the counselors writing young campers names on their arms and legs with Sharpies so that authorities could identify them if necessary  are among the first to emerge recounting the grim reality of the torrent of water that surged Friday through the all-girls Camp Mystic, where at least 27 campers and counselors are known to have died. Coast Guard petty officer Scott Ruskan, 26, of Oxford, New Jersey, spoke of plucking mud-covered children to safety after his helicopter crew flew through appalling weather to reach the campsite in rural Hunt early on Friday afternoon. He and his colleagues, he told the Washington Post, were greeted with scenes of devastation, and dozens of children, teenage camp counselors and staff desperate to escape. Thats how quickly this floodwater rose, he told the newspaper in a phone interview. They didnt have time to grab shoes. Youre just carrying kids that dont have shoes on, theyre covered in mud, and youre trying to get them out of there. Some of it was simply talking to them and consoling them and trying to make them feel comfortable.

The storms that battered the Hill Country for the past four days began to lighten up, although isolated pockets of heavy rain were still possible. Share Updated at 13.12 EDT\n\n3h ago 12.32 EDT In remarks to reporters alongside his cabinet, Donald Trump repeated that he will be in Texas on Friday. Melania Trump, the first lady, will accompany him. The president said: Texas, and the governor, has been obviously very good for years with me. Share Updated at 12.43 EDT\n\n3h ago 12.27 EDT Noem: 'The state' manages disasters, not the federal government At Donald Trumps cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon, Kristi Noem spoke about leading the federal response to the flooding disaster and said she was overcome with emotion during her trip to Texas, the Associated Press reported. Very emotional, but also just so tragic, the homeland security secretary said.\n\n\n\nNoem said Texas is strong but also noted, We, as a federal government, dont manage these disasters. The state does.\n\n\n\nWere cutting through the paperwork of the old Fema streamlining it, much like your vision of how Fema should operate, Noem said of Trumps promise to scrap the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). Noem added, that Americans helping one another after such tragic events is proof, God created us to take care of each other. Share Updated at 12.34 EDT\n\n3h ago 12.12 EDT Intense rainstorms are becoming more frequent in most of the US  though experts tell the Associated Press where they occur and whether they cause catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance. Although it can be difficult to attribute a single weather event to climate change, experts told the AP that a warming atmosphere and oceans due to the burning of fossil fuels make catastrophic storms more likely.\n\n\n\nThats because the atmosphere can hold 7% more water for every 1C (1.8F), creating a giant sponge of sorts that sucks up moisture from bodies of water and vegetation. The moisture later falls back to earth in increasingly intense, unpredictable and destructive downpours.\n\n\n\nIts just loading the dice toward heavy rainfall when the situation is right, said Kenneth Kunkel, a climate scientist at North Carolina State University, told the AP.

        "content": "J Michael Luttig, a conservative former federal judge, has said how he is disappointed in his friend John Roberts, the chief justice of the United States, for an unforgivable reticence about Donald Trump.\n\nLuttig was long considered a possible supreme court nominee himself. He shepherded Clarence Thomas through his contentious supreme court confirmation hearing in 1991 and was a mentor to the Texas senator Ted Cruz.\n\nBut Luttig has emerged as an outspoken Trump critic, testifying to a congressional panel that investigated the January 6 attack on the US Capitol which Trump incited in an effort to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe former judge has now put both friendship and convention aside to condemn Roberts for failing to take a robust stand against Trumps attacks on the courts and increasing threats of violence against judges.\n\nJohn, my friend, is one of the smartest people Ive ever met in my life, Luttig told historians Sidney Blumenthal and Sean Wilentz on their Court of History podcast. There is nothing that John Roberts is not aware of and, at the top of that list, is self-awareness. He knows everything thats going on and thats why Ive been so disappointed in him.\n\nTrump has frequently denounced judges whose rulings block his agenda but Roberts has been selective in his pushback. In 2018, after Trump criticised a federal judge who ruled against his asylum policy as an Obama judge, Roberts insisted: We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.\n\nEarlier this year, when Trump called for the impeachment of district judge James Boasberg, who had blocked Trumps administration from deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members, Roberts said impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\n\nIn a subsequent Fox News interview, Trump said: Well, he didnt mention my name in the statement. The president also prompted Washington gossip after his speech to a joint session of Congress by shaking Robertss hand, patting him on the shoulder and saying: Thank you again. Thank you again. Wont forget.\n\nCritics argue that Roberts rulings have enabled Trumps expansive view of presidential power, creating a tension between his institutionalist stance and his judicial philosophy. Last week he joined the conservative majority in deciding to curb the power of federal judges to impose nationwide rulings impeding his policies.\n\nLuttig, who served on the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit from 1991 to 2006, said on the podcast: I understand the two issues that plague him. One is the internal workings of the court itself, and Ill say no more, but you know what Im talking about.\n\nAnd then his unforgivable reticence to speak out directly against the president of the United States of America when he knows, and the rest of the world knows, that this is the president of the United States of America.\n\nHe added: It was unforgivable, in my view, for the chief to continue to make these broad statements, meaningless statements, and attribute the misconduct to all of us. All of us. Obviously, the chief justice has said you, the Democrats, are every bit as responsible for this as the Republicans. Thats offensive.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wilentz, a history professor at Princeton University, asked Luttig if he thinks Roberts is aware of the damage to both the courts reputation and the chief justices own.\n\nLuttig said Roberts knows everything there is to know about the perception, politics and institution of the court. There is no one smarter than John Roberts as to all of that so, in answer to your question, he knows perfectly well.\n\nBlumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, asked if the Roberts cares about historical judgment or only lives in the present. He has made the decision between the moment and history already, and he cannot recover that decision, Luttig replied.\n\nWilentz also raised the issue of Roberts responsibility to the federal judiciary at a time of rising political violence. Luttig recalled a recent visit to New York when he was invited to appear on a cable news show with Judge Esther Salas, whose husband was shot and son killed by a disgruntled lawyer five years ago.\n\nLuttig was asked by the programmes host, Nicolle Wallace, if it would be helpful for Roberts to be sitting with them. I said, Nicolle, it would not just be helpful, its obligatory. Its a profound obligation. Its his highest obligation as chief justice of the United States to speak for the safety of the federal judges in this country and I said his problem is that would require condemning the president of the United States.\n\nBut right now, today, the chief justice of the United States is sitting on that fact and I cant even imagine that the federal judges arent sitting there wondering what on earth is going on  I couldnt look myself in the mirror."

        "content": "The politics of fewer babies\n\nFamilies in the U.S. and much of the world are having so few babies, national populations are set to shrink and age. The trend is changing American politics and fueling the rise of global populism.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nAmerican women are having far fewer babies, and some politicians want to change that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll be known as the fertilization president, and that's OK. That's not bad. That's not bad. I've been called much worse.\n\nKELLY: That's President Trump at a Women's History Month event earlier this year. The birth rate is now falling so fast in the U.S. and around the world that the shift is driving a new political debate over what, if anything, can be done about it. NPR's Sarah McCammon and Brian Mann found much of the debate here in the U.S. is being shaped by politicians and activists on the right.\n\nSARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: When we visit her home outside New York City, Lusely Martinez (ph) is cooking dinner for her family.\n\nLUSELY MARTINEZ: I think I'm going to need some more oil. Do we have any more oil?\n\nMCCAMMON: Her 5-year-old daughter is coloring at the kitchen counter.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FOOD SIZZLING)\n\nMARTINEZ: You finished all your homework, right? It was just the one sheet?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Yep.\n\nBRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Lusely is 35 years old. Her husband, Byron, is 40, and they adore their daughter.\n\nMARTINEZ: She's like a physical embodiment of what my - the relationship of my life, you know? And then we get to watch our little heart walk around all over the world and, like, learn and discover things. It's just so incredible just to see her learn and grow.\n\nMANN: But here's the thing. Their daughter is their only child, and Lusely says they've pretty much decided one is enough.\n\nMARTINEZ: I remember, at one point, I was like, I definitely want three kids. I was like, that's going to be great. That's what my mom had. That's what I want to have.\n\nMCCAMMON: But then Lusely says she had a tough pregnancy with painful complications that ended in a C-section.\n\nMARTINEZ: That's just one part of the equation, right?\n\nMANN: And Lusely says having more children often seemed unaffordable. She and her husband, Byron, have good, stable careers. She works for a company in human resources. He has a union construction job, but they worry about the rising cost of everything.\n\nMARTINEZ: And the other part is having a child is extremely expensive.\n\nMANN: Researchers say a lot of American families are making similar calculations. The average woman today has roughly half as many children compared to the 1960s. So few that researchers at the Brookings Institution found that without a lot of immigration, the U.S. population would age and shrink rapidly. But Lusely says for them, this is a personal decision.\n\nMARTINEZ: We're stopping, and we're thinking about, is this actually smart for ourselves? Will we be able to give this child a good life?\n\nMCCAMMON: Experts say American society is already changing, as couples like Lusely and Byron have fewer children, or some have no children at all. A study released last month by the U.S. census found that people over 65 now outnumber children in 11 states, and that's up from just three states where that was true five years ago. Emma Waters is with the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, and she's been thinking about this.\n\nEMMA WATERS: It means that we're going to have more adults than we have children to replace them, and that will heavily impact things like our military readiness, our overall GDP and economic growth in the United States.\n\nMCCAMMON: Waters thinks that without more babies, the U.S. will struggle to do basic things like funding Social Security.\n\nWATERS: If you don't have enough workers, you won't have enough people to actually support older generations and those who are aging now.\n\nMANN: So now some of the country's most high-profile conservatives, including Trump, Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, say they want to reverse this trend. Here's Vance speaking at the March for Life earlier this year.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJD VANCE: So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America.\n\nMANN: There's a pattern here, of course. Virtually all of the attention so far to falling birth rates in the U.S. is coming from political figures on the right.\n\nMCCAMMON: Ruth Braunstein is a sociologist at Johns Hopkins, and she studies right-wing rhetoric.\n\nRUTH BRAUNSTEIN: There's claims that we are experiencing a fertility crisis, and they are looking at data that is real and legitimate data, that shows declining birth rates in the United States and really around the world.\n\nMCCAMMON: But Braunstein thinks some far-right politicians are keying into this question about babies and birth rates because of other big demographic trends that are making the U.S. more secular and more religiously and racially diverse.\n\nBRAUNSTEIN: This caused a real sense of crisis on the right - everywhere from mainstream conservatism to the far right - about the kind of decline of what their vision of America was supposed to look like. So the solution became fertility.\n\nMANN: Some activists and politicians on the left worry this focus on fertility by conservatives is also part of a wider agenda designed to limit reproductive rights and other freedoms for women. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about this during a public event at the 92nd Street Y in New York in May.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: This very blatant effort to basically send a message, most exemplified by Vance and Musk and others, that, you know, what we really need from you women are more children. And what that really means is you should go back to doing what you were born to do, which is to produce more children.\n\nMANN: Clinton also said the Trump administration's immigration policies - deporting many young people who might settle in the U.S. and build families - are at odds with the goal of seeing more babies born in the United States.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCLINTON: Which is sort of odd because the people who produce the most children in our country are immigrants, and they want to deport them. So none of this adds up.\n\nMCCAMMON: But some conservatives say the push for more babies isn't about race or immigration. Lyman Stone, who leads the Pronatalism Initiative at the conservative-leaning Institute for Family Studies, acknowledges that some on the far-right believe more babies being born in the U.S. would translate into more white people. But Stone says that's just not true because younger Americans, those of childbearing age, are also more diverse.\n\nLYMAN STONE: If we increase fertility in the U.S., the pace at which we become a less white nation accelerates. I know that this kind of surprises people when you say this, but it's really quite simple math.\n\nMCCAMMON: But Stone says he does want to see big changes in the way young people are living their lives. He wants U.S. policy to encourage the kinds of stable, prosperous families where children are more possible. And he says many young people feel they're not hitting all the marks they need to hit before having kids.\n\nSTONE: They're not marrying in time. They're not getting a house in time. They're not getting a stable job in time, all these things. And so what's really happening is people are involuntarily falling short of their desired fertility.\n\nMANN: Stone thinks there are some policies that might encourage couples in the U.S. to have more babies. He supports expanding tax credits for families with kids, and he says letting parents work from home may also be helpful. But he's skeptical of one of Trump's main ideas, a plan to create $1,000 investment accounts for new babies, which children could draw from as they grow up.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: Trump accounts will contribute to the lifelong success of millions of newborn babies.\n\nMCCAMMON: Stone and other experts we talked to said they don't think that's an immediate or big enough incentive to change most people's minds about parenting. And Lusely Martinez agrees.\n\nMARTINEZ: I think that's my biggest concern is, like, what is the big focus on us having children when you're not necessarily focused on how the rest of the life of a person is, right?\n\nMCCAMMON: A lot of countries around the world are trying far more robust pronatalist policies, everything from free child care and health care to extended parental leave.\n\nMANN: But researchers say even those programs tend to produce only small and often temporary increases in the number of births, and those policies are far more generous and expensive than what's being proposed here in the U.S., even by politicians who say declining birth rates are a crisis. I'm Brian Mann.\n\nMCCAMMON: And I'm Sarah McCammon, NPR News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DAFT PUNK SONG, \"INSTANT CRUSH (FEAT. JULIAN CASABLANCAS)\")\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "content": "The Trump administration on Monday shut down a federal website that had presented congressionally mandated reports and research on climate change, drawing rebukes from scientists who said it will hinder the nations efforts to prepare for worsening droughts, floods and heat waves.\n\nThe U.S. Global Change Research Programs website, globalchange.gov, was taken down along with all five versions of the National Climate Assessment report and extensive information on how global warming is affecting the country.\n\nTheyre public documents. Its scientific censorship at its worst, said Peter Gleick, a California water and climate scientist who was one of the authors of the first National Climate Assessment in 2000. This is the modern version of book burning.\n\nThe climate reports were required by Congress, and there will still be alternative ways of finding them even without the website, Gleick said. But this information will be harder and harder for the American public to find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House didnt immediately provide comments about the removal of the website.\n\nIn May, Trump signed an executive order saying that his administration is committed to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and that federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available.\n\nThe president cited an example relating to climate science, saying federal agencies previously used a worst-case scenario of warming based on highly unlikely assumptions.\n\nThe U.S. Global Change Research Program was established under a 1990 law, which also mandated that climate assessments be prepared every four years. In April, however, the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and other experts who had begun to write the latest National Climate Assessment report.\n\nThis is scientific information that the American taxpayers paid for, and its their right to have it, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University who was an author of four previous versions of the climate assessment report. Its information that I, as a scientist, can say is absolutely critical to making good decisions for the future, whether youre a farmer, a homeowner, a business owner, a city manager, or anyone really who wants to ensure a safe and resilient future for themselves and for their children.\n\nHayhoe noted the 1990 law mandates that the programs research findings be available to all federal agencies and departments, and that the National Climate Assessments be available digitally.\n\nHayhoe said the websites many resources had included an interactive atlas of projected changes in hot and cold days, rainfall amounts and other effects per degree of warming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClimate is changing faster than any time in human history, and we know that if we dont adapt, if we dont build resilience into all of our systems  our food and water systems, our infrastructure and our health systems  that we will suffer the consequences, Hayhoe said.\n\nShe said the National Climate Assessments have helped bridge the physiological distance for Americans.\n\nIt tells people in your region, here is what is already happening and here is what is going to happen, and here is how it is affecting your home, your insurance rates, your water, your food, the plants and animals that you see around you, she said.\n\nUntil Monday, the website globalchange.gov made available more than 200 publications. They included the research programs yearly reports to Congress and studies on the Arctic, agriculture and human health. A few were republished reports from other organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe globalchange.gov website, shown June 29, 2025, was taken down the next day.\n\nThe site also hosted dozens of webpages, educational podcasts and videos on topics including sea level rise, greenhouse gases, biodiversity and drought.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe top item on the homepage was the Fifth National Climate Assessment, which it described as the preeminent source of authoritative information on the risks, impacts, and responses to climate change in the United States.\n\nBut the Trump administration has cut funding for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which oversees the assessments.\n\nAround April 10, a small yellow banner appeared at the top of the site, reading: The operations and structure of the [U.S. Global Change Research Program] are currently under review.\n\nPrevious versions of the website can still be found using the nonprofit Internet Archive s Wayback Machine , which keeps snapshots of sites to help track changes.\n\nThe shutdown of the website comes after the Trump administration also took down another site, climate.gov, which had been maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That occurred after much of the staff that had worked on the site were reportedly dismissed . (The climate.gov website now redirects users to noaa.gov/climate.)\n\nGleick said the new NOAA website is a pale substitute for the extensive information that was previously available. He said he believes the removal of websites with scientific research on global warming, driven by fossil fuels and rising levels of greenhouse gases, appears aimed at hiding the risks from the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayhoe and other climate scientists said that following the dismissal of the team that had been working on the Sixth National Climate Assessment, they still dont know what the Trump administrations plans are for the next congressionally required report.\n\nThe deeper threat to the country is that we wont do the new assessments that are necessary to understand the latest research on climate threats to the country, Gleick said. It seems like anything climate related is being either cut to the bone or completely eliminated, with no assessment of its value or importance."

        "content": "Editors Note: Abigail Disney is an Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker, activist, and member of the Patriotic Millionaires. Her latest film, The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales, co-directed with Kathleen Hughes, made its world premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. Morris Pearl is the chair of Patriotic Millionaires, and former managing director of BlackRock. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN \n\nTuesday is Tax Day in America, one of the most stressful days of the year, when many taxpayers will finally end their procrastination, file their federal returns, and hope for a refund from the IRS. But for many of the nations wealthiest, its just another Tuesday.\n\nAbigail Disney Grasstaken, Roo Castro and Rod Coplin\n\nMorris Pearl Beatrice Mortiz\n\nTax Day isnt just a filing deadline  its also an annual reminder that the ultra-rich exist in an entirely separate world when it comes to taxes. For us, the loopholes are bigger and the rates are sometimes lower. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer, with the wealth of billionaires in particular growing by more than $1.5 trillion over the last few years.\n\nThis status quo is unfair, but even more importantly, its unsustainable. Such high levels of inequality are pushing our economy and our democracy to their breaking points. Thats why we should examine how we can set our country up for long-term stability and prosperity. And we should start by ensuring that the ultra-rich pay more of what they owe the country that made their success possible.\n\nThere are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that:\n\nTax all types of income the same for high earners\n\nRight now, the US tax system values money over sweat. If you work hard for your money instead of earning it passively, youre essentially penalized for it. People who earn a salary pay significantly higher tax rates on their income than wealthy investors who passively earn capital gains income.\n\nInheriting money is an even better deal. Thanks to former president Donald Trumps 2017 tax law, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any estate tax, and the stepped-up basis loophole allows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owners death. With this, it becomes relatively simple for the rich to inherit tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars, and pay almost nothing in taxes. Someone working for that money, on the other hand, would pay over a third of it in federal income taxes.\n\nWhy do we have a tax code that says working people should be taxed more than wealthy investors and those who got rich just by virtue of being born into the right family? At the end of the day, money is money, whether you worked for it or whether you inherited it. As an heiress and an investor, we should not be paying lower tax rates than people who earn their money from working.\n\nIts time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income.\n\nTax wealth or unrealized capital gains\n\nWe cant just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. Capital gains are only taxed when assets are sold, so instead of selling them, the ultra-rich use their assets as collateral to borrow vast sums of money at extremely low interest rates to live on, and then declare little or even negative income on their tax forms. This Buy, Borrow, Die strategy is a major reason billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate over recent years than working-class families.\n\nBy rethinking what is taxable, we can get access to the trillions of dollars of billionaire wealth that is untouchable under our current tax structure. Thats why President Biden has proposed the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires.\n\nTax the highest earners more\n\nFinally, one of the most straightforward changes needed is to simply tax the extremely rich more than the merely rich. Our income tax caps out at a top rate of 37% for any income over $578,125 (or $693,750 for married couples). No matter how much more someone makes, theyll never pay more than 37% in federal income taxes.\n\nWhile someone earning $600,000 is certainly making enough to live a very comfortable life, theyre in a different world than someone making $600 million a year. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the top rates we had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. They should reach up to 90% for people making more than $100 million a year.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThese three changes certainly wont fix all our countrys problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our countrys wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable. The tax code can be a powerful tool for both social and economic change. We just need to use it more effectively."

        "content": "Maryland parents in 2023 protest a policy preventing them from removing their children from lessons on religious grounds. The Supreme Court sided with the parents on Friday.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Friday that parents have a right to opt their schoolchildren out of classes and lessons that offend their religious beliefs.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling will have an impact nationwide because it empowers parents who object to books or lessons at school.\n\nA government burdens the religious exercise of parents when it requires them to submit their children to instruction that poses a very real threat of undermining the religious beliefs and practices that the parents wish to instill, said Justice Samuel A. Alito, speaking for the conservative majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents in Montgomery County, Md., sued over new LGBTQ+ storybooks that were used in kindergarten and elementary school classes.\n\nThis clash between progressive educators and religiously conservative parents moved quickly to the Supreme Court after judges refused to intervene.\n\nAlito said the parents were entitled to a preliminary injunction that would require the schools to notify them in advance when one of the disputed storybooks would be used in their childs class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn ruling for the parents, the court did not say parents have a right to change the lessons and books that were used at school. They could, however, choose to have their children temporarily removed from those classes.\n\nThe courts three liberals dissented.\n\nTodays ruling ushers in ... new reality,  Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. Casting aside long-standing precedent, the Court invents a constitutional right to avoid exposure to subtle themes contrary to the religious principles that parents wish to instill in their children. Given the great diversity of religious beliefs in this country, countless interactions that occur every day in public schools might expose children to messages that conflict with a parents religious beliefs. The result will be chaos for this Nations public schools.\n\nEric Baxter, senior counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, called the decision a historic victory for parental rights in Maryland and across America. Kids shouldnt be forced into conversations about drag queens, Pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents permission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe appealed the case to the Supreme Court last fall.\n\nToday, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents  not government have the final say in how their children are raised, he said.\n\nCivil rights advocates condemned the ruling.\n\nAll students deserve to feel safe and welcome in their classrooms. Educators should prepare them for the world we live in and promote curiosity, acceptance, and respect for all people. Yet todays decision by six justices encourages open discrimination toward LGBTQ+ children and families and favors ignorance and censorship over inclusion, said Liz King, director for education equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\nNearly every state, including Maryland and California, has a law that allows parents to opt out their children from sex education classes.\n\nBut Montgomery County officials said this state rule applied to older students and to sex education, but not to reading lessons for elementary school children.\n\nWhen the new LGBTQ+ storybooks were introduced in the fall of 2022, parents were told their young children could be removed from those lessons. But when unsustainably high numbers of children were absent, the school board revoked the opt-out rule.\n\nIn reaction, a group of Muslim, Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox parents filed a suit in federal court, seeking an order that would allow their children to be removed from class during the reading lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA federal judge and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to intervene.\n\nThose judges said the free exercise of religion under the 1st Amendment protects people from being forced to change their conduct or their beliefs but it does not shield people from views they oppose.\n\nLawyers for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThey said the school board had mandated new inclusive storybooks that celebrate gender transitions, explore Pride parades and introduce same-sex romance between young children.\n\nAt first, parents had been promised they would be notified and could opt their children out when the storybooks were read, they said. But that promise was revoked.\n\nIf parents did not like what was taught to their elementary school kids, their only choice was to send them to private school or to home school, they said."

        "content": "A national hotline will no longer provide services specifically for LGBTQ+ youths in crisis. The Trump administration is ending that support next month.\n\nThe 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has counselors for anyone in emotional distress or contemplating suicide but also has connected LGBTQ+ youth with specially trained counselors. Research has shown this population experiences significantly higher rates of suicidal ideation. But that specialized service will end July 17.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which funds the 988 hotline, said in a statement that callers would no longer have the option to press 3 for LGBTQ+-specific services. The agency said it would not silo LGB+ youth services but rather focus on serving all who are seeking help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor members of the LGBTQ+ community in Los Angeles, there are other options, with specifically trained mental health counselors. But advocates for the 988 service say its loss will leave a hole in crisis intervention.\n\nThis is one more way that people are going to feel like theyre not seen, arent sure of where to reach out for help or dont feel safe enough to seek support, said Terra Russell-Slavin, chief impact officer with the Los Angeles LGBT Center.\n\nThey noted that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announcement used the acronym LGB+. Despite trans youth being a group vulnerable to suicidal ideation, they said, they literally ... removed the word trans from the purpose of the hotline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn less than 30 days, the program that has provided life-saving services to more than 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people nationwide will no longer be available for those who need it, said Jaymes Black in a statement. Black is chief executive of the Trevor Project, which has been providing counseling targeted at LGBTQ+ youth through the 988 hotline since 2022.\n\nThe administrations decision to remove a bipartisan, evidence-based service that has effectively supported a high-risk group of young people through their darkest moments is incomprehensible, Black said.\n\nLinda Yoon, founder of Yellow Chair Collective, said the Trevor Project has been a lifesaving resource for many queer youth, including some of the collectives clients. The group provides LGBTQ+ affirming counseling among other services and focuses on providing mental health support for Asian American and multicultural populations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLosing that federally funded support is incredibly concerning, Yoon told The Times. These specialized services exist for a reason  they meet needs that general services often overlook or are unequipped to address.\n\nQueer youth experience significantly higher rates of suicidal ideation than their non-LGBTQ+ peers, experts say.\n\nMore than 1.8 million LGBTQ+ young people in the United States seriously consider suicide each year, and at least one attempts suicide every 45 seconds, according to the Trevor Project.\n\nYoon and her team see youths in crisis in their clinical work.\n\nMany of our LGBTQ+ youth clients come in with more complex, high-risk cases, she said, especially when they come from unsupportive or unsafe family environments  which, unfortunately, still happens far too often.\n\nMore than 50 queer youths seek services from Yellow Chair Collective per year, and many are looking for support after a crisis or when theyve struggled to access the care they need elsewhere.\n\nThe 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline was a resource that the collective made known to clients. Going forward, the group will refer them to the Trevor Project, which Yoon said would continue to offer crisis support independently, 24/7.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trevor Project can be reached at (866) 488-7386. You can also text or chat.\n\nSuicide prevention and crisis counseling resources If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, seek help from a professional and call 9-8-8. The United States first nationwide three-digit mental health crisis hotline 988 will connect callers with trained mental health counselors. Text HOME to 741741 in the U.S. and Canada to reach the Crisis Text Line. More resources\n\nIn 2022, about 17 years after the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline was launched with a federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 988 began the pilot phase of its specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth. At the time, the Trevor Project served as the sole provider of the services. Eventually it was one of seven centers providing help.\n\nLast year, according to the Trevor Project, its counselors helped an estimated 500,000 people  nearly half of whom came through the 988 hotline.\n\nAt the local level, the Los Angeles County Mental Health Department offers a crisis helpline thats staffed 24/7 to connect residents with resources including mental health professionals with specific training and programs designed for LGBTQ+ individuals and families.\n\nYoon still fears the consequences of losing the 988 service for high-risk queer youth. Its help has been not only tailored but also prompt.\n\nWe know in a crisis being able to respond within a timely manner is very important, she said.\n\nAs for Russell-Slavin, they worry about the moment of crisis, when the right contact can make all the difference. They fear that having to find a new, appropriate number to call could be one obstacle too many.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of those things are just going to create more barriers, they said, and those barriers are part of whats contributing to the harm.\n\nLGBTQ+ focused crisis hotlines\n\nLos Angeles Countys Alternative Crisis Response: Through this program, you can access the countys 24/7 helpline at (800) 854-7771 to connect with culturally responsive services and resources, including mental health professionals specifically trained and programs that are specially designed for LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nThe Trevor Project: The project provides crisis services and peer support nationwide. You can access services by texting START to 678-678, calling the hotline at (866)-488-7386 or by live chatting with a professional online.\n\nTrans Lifeline: The grassroots hotline and nonprofit organization offers direct emotional and financial support to trans people in crisis.

        "content": "Donald Trumps announcement calling off trade talks with Canada over its digital tax  and that he would impose retaliatory tariffs  demonstrates, once again, not only the presidents ignorance of economics and willful disregard of international norms and the rule of law, but also his willingness to use brute power to get whatever he and the oligarchs who support him want.\n\nHe was wrong in labeling the tax as outrageous and a direct and blatant attack on our country. It is actually an efficient tax, well designed to ensure that the technology companies  the profits of which benefit the tech oligarchs who have come to dominate US policy  pay their fair share of taxes.\n\nIt is accordingly disappointing that Canada appears to have caved, even more so as the prime minister had stood up strongly against Trumps demand for Canada to become the 51st state. Regrettably, others are giving in  New Zealand and India have reportedly retreated.\n\nTrumps bullying tactics have been in evidence since he took office. In January he threatened to double taxes on Australian citizens and companies in the US if they went ahead with their planned digital levy.\n\nWhy digital taxes?\n\nBecause digital companies operate all over the globe, and generate revenue in countries where they do not have a physical presence, they avoid taxation by shifting revenue and profit around the world. Some of the most egregious examples include Google moving $17bn to Bermuda, Apple owing France 10 years of back taxes, and the Italian governments recent investigation of Meta over whether the firm owes 938m in VAT payments. Apple was so successful in avoiding taxes in Europe that it is estimated that it paid in some years a tax of just 0.005% on its European profits. Of course, when the most profitable companies in the world dont pay their fair share of taxes, it just shifts the burden on to others.\n\nAs more and more activity occurs online, and often from services provided from abroad, countries are losing revenue from sales, employment and profits taxes. Just because an activity is provided digitally doesnt mean it should not be taxed; indeed, economists argue that digital taxes are among the easiest to administer, precisely because there is a digital record. The idea of the digital service tax is to help countries recoup revenue by taxing any kind of digital service provided from anywhere in the world: online sales, digital advertising, data usage, e-commerce or streaming services. They might include consumption taxes on internet purchases. Indeed, more than 18 countries have such taxes and some 20 others have proposed them.\n\nImposing digital services taxes will incur the wrath of the US government and tech giants, but countries are well within their rights to do so\n\nWhen it looked like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) would get a global agreement to raise corporate taxes, the agreement included a prohibition on digital taxes. Indeed, one of the reasons that the US was even willing to engage in these discussions on global taxation was to circumscribe others ability to impose such taxes. While that agreement was under discussion, the US government, influenced by its tech giants, strongly opposed these digital taxes and then US treasury secretary Janet Yellen spent a good deal of time calling up her counterparts and telling them not to impose them.\n\nBut on 20 January, Trump issued an executive order saying that the agreement that had been negotiated over years and years had no force or effect in the US. As a result, more countries are now trying to decide whether to keep or adopt digital services taxes. Imposing them will incur the wrath of the US government and tech giants, but countries are well within their rights to do so. Indeed, there was a moratorium on levying digital taxes while there were some prospects of the OECD agreement going into effect; but with Trump, that prospect has all but disappeared, and that moratorium has come to end.\n\nAny country concerned with designing efficient, fair and easy-to-administer digital services duties should consider such taxes  indeed, they have the support not only of economists but of global civil society, including the Independent Commission on Reform of International Corporate Taxation (which I co-chair).\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A country may be foolish, levying taxes that are not good for its economy, but so be it: that is a matter for the country to decide. In this case, the tax is actually good for the economy. What Trump has been doing has violated international norms in several ways: using the threat of tariffs or taxes against corporations headquartered in a country whose policy he dislikes, and walking away from what were supposed to be binding trade agreements, without even a pretense of using the mechanisms for dispute resolution embodied in those agreements.\n\nThe question now: will countries cave in to these threats or can they stick together and collect the billions they are rightly owed? Make no mistake: what is at stake is more than money that will be collected. It is a matter of the rule of law, which Trump has trampled on so fiercely, both within the US and globally. The rule of law is essential not just for economic performance, but for social justice and democracy. And Canadas capitulation to Trumps unilateral move makes a mockery of the whole process by which international agreements are negotiated. Some were skeptical that the so-called inclusive framework was but a facade: others may have been at the table, but their voices were not heard. What has now happened verifies this: whatever the US wants, it gets.\n\nCanada should have stood up for its principles and national sovereignty, even in the face of such transparent bullying. The alternative now emerging is the law of the jungle, brute power and Canada becoming, de facto, the 51st US state."

        "content": "30 Years After His Death, Andy Warhols Spirit Is Still Very Much Alive\n\nR.C. Baker | The Village Voice\n\nHow much responsibility does a mirror bear for whatever beauty or ugliness it beholds? Warhol loved both the heights and depths of American culture, and reflected it back at us through his work, which remains resonant to this day. Here is the spin he put on the concept of American exceptionalism in the 1985 America book: Maybe you think it's so special that certain people shouldn't be allowed to live [here], or if they do live [here] that they shouldn't say certain things or have certain ideas.\n\nThe Rise of Roxane Gay\n\nMolly McArdle | Brooklyn Magazine\n\nGay has been persistent and precise when so many others have not: She believes in a substantial variety of writers and writing that includes not only race and gender and sexuality but also class, ability, geography. She also takes as long and hard a look at herself as she does anyone else. When considering, in her 2010 HTMLGiant essay A Profound Sense of Absence, whether or not she read diversely, Gay concludes: I dont, nor do I know how to.\n\nThe Age of Rudeness\n\nRachel Cusk | The New York Times Magazine\n\nAre people rude because they are unhappy? Is rudeness like nakedness, a state deserving the tact and mercy of the clothed? If we are polite to rude people, perhaps we give them back their dignity; yet the obsessiveness of the rude presents certain challenges to the proponents of civilized behavior. It is an act of disinhibition: Like a narcotic, it offers a sensation of glorious release from jailers no one else can see.\n\n\n\nIn Get Out, Racism Is the Horror Story Black People Try to Survive\n\nFrederick McKindra | BuzzFeed\n\nHorror films constantly reinforced the concept of the white bodys vulnerability, and subtly advised their audiences to treat only those bodies with concern. Meanwhile, for black characters, and by extension, black people, if no one ever saw you scream, tremble, or bleed, they never learned to see you as human. In the aughts, black characters in horror films were either disposable, not worth depicting at all, or rendered racial amnesiacs when it came to issues that would concern any black person in real life.\n\nRemembering Seijun Suzuki, an Absurdist Auteur in Hired-Gun Clothing\n\nEmily Yoshida | Vulture\n\nThe Japanese film-production world was a kind of temporary Wild West, no longer locked into the hierarchical promotion system that brought up Ozu and Kurosawa. Suzuki rose up through the reshuffling almost by accident, but once he became a director, he made sure nobody forgot his name.\n\n\n\nHarry Belafonte and the Social Power of a Song\n\nAmanda Petrusich | The New Yorker\n\nBelafonte was strikingly prescient about the ways in which taste could and would be politicized, and especially about how treacherous it is to confuse consumption with action. This seems, to me, to be an unspoken but profound hindrance to all popular rebellions: If a person reads the right authors, and buys the right records, and vouches for those preferences loudly and repeatedly, it can feel like all the necessary work has been done to align oneself with the proper causes.\n\n\n\nJackie Kennedys Strange, Elegant Accent, Explained by Linguists\n\nAlex Abad-Santos | Vox\n\nMerely reading that line doesnt do justice to the voice Portman adopted for the role. If youre not aware of how Jackie Kennedy spoke, listening to Portmans Jackie is like the tingle of soda in your throat. It often feels familiar, but in certain spots it pops and jumps. The way she lops off the end of bitter, the funny hop in artifact, the way she rolls through rememberedits like shes invented her own unique way of speaking English.\n\nMoonlights Forgotten Frequencies\n\nDave Tompkins | MTV News\n\nMoonlight's score is part of this allowed emotional space, internalizing the Miami environment. (In terms of pressing bass to vinyl, wider spaces between the grooves make room for longer wavelengths and lower frequencies.) According to [Nicholas] Britell, the composer, everything in Moonlights score has at some point been pitched down and lived an alternate bass life before reaching your ears, whether you hear it or not."

        "content": "Fears of a possible constitutional crisis are on the rise following an apparent standoff between Donald Trump and a federal judge after the president was ordered to stop deportation flights traveling to El Salvador. Meanwhile, Trump also moved to dismantle the Department of Education this weekand it is still unclear how much of the agency will remain intact. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has gone after executive agencies, congressionally authorized programs, the military, and now hes going after the judiciary, David Ignatius said last night. I do think that ahead of us is a confrontation in which the Supreme Court is going to decide what executive authority the president has. But until that moment is reached, he continued, I wouldnt say were at the constitutional crisis.\n\nIts not unheard of that a litigant before a court would defy a judge, what would be unheard of is if it went to the end of the road to the Supreme Court, Michael Scherer added to the discussion. If he defies this court, that would be a remarkable moment.\n\nJoining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Eugene Daniels, a senior Washington correspondent and co-host of The Weekend on MSNBC; David Ignatius, a columnist at The Washington Post; Michael Scherer, a staff writer at The Atlantic; Nancy Youssef, a national-security correspondent for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWatch the full episode here."

        "content": "The vast majority of California voters support expanding access to translated ballots for people who speak limited English, according to a new poll.\n\nThe vast majority of California voters support expanding access to translated ballots for people who speak limited English, an effort that would likely increase turnout, a new poll found.\n\nThat finding comes from a poll released Monday by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, which conducted the survey in five languages  English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese  to capture voter sentiment in a state where more than a quarter of residents are foreign born.\n\nThe poll, conducted for the nonprofit Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund, found that about 70% of Californias registered voters agreed that eligible voters who speak limited English should be provided with ballots translated into their preferred language. Support was strong among all age groups, races and ethnicities, as well as among Democrats and independent voters. Republicans were closely divided.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think in the country as a whole theres a lot of debate and struggle over how inclusive a democracy were going to be and a lot of controversy over immigration, immigrant rights, immigrant inclusion, said political scientist Eric Schickler, co-director of the Institute of Governmental Studies. Its timely just thinking about the question of inclusion of different groups  who feels fully American and is allowed to feel fully American in our political system.\n\nSchickler and others said that, according to the latest estimates, more than 3 million registered voters in California self-identify as limited-English proficient. As of February, just under 23 million Californians were registered to vote.\n\nUnder state and federal law, California is required to provide bilingual voting assistance to Spanish speakers. Nine counties  Alameda, Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Orange, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara  must provide voting materials in at least one language other than English or Spanish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated sample ballots and other assistance also must be made available in Spanish or other languages in counties or precincts where the state has determined at least 3% of the voting-age residents are members of a single-language minority and dont understand English well enough to vote without assistance.\n\nThe Berkeley survey found that 82% of Democrats supported providing translated ballot materials to limited-English voters, as did 72% of voters registered as no party preference. Among Republicans, 45% supported providing the translated ballots, while 42% did not.\n\nAccording to the poll, most California voters also favored a proposal that recently went before the state Legislature that would have allowed all limited-English-speaking communities that meet a minimum threshold in a county to receive translated versions of all voting materials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegislation to that effect, SB 266, proposed by Sen. Sabrina Cervantes (D-Riverside), failed to pass out of the Senate Appropriations Committee. A more ambitious bill to expand access to translated ballots and materials, AB 884, passed the Legislature in 2024, but was vetoed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The governor stated that while he supported expanding ballot access, the bill would have cost tens of millions of dollars not included in the budget.\n\nProviding translated ballots to California voters with limited English proficiency is critical in a state that is home to such a diverse electorate  and is known for its complex state and local ballot measures, said Rosalind Gold of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund.\n\nEven folks who are very educated and native-born English speakers find trying to decipher the description of a ballot measure and what it means to be challenging, Gold said.\n\nProviding translated sample ballots and other election materials to voters does not go far enough, she said: The official ballots themselves, whether for Californians who vote by mail or those who vote at polling stations, should be provided in a voters preferred language.\n\nIt is difficult to basically, kind of go back and forth between the ballot youre going to be marking your choices on and a sample ballot or a facsimile ballot thats in your native language, Gold said. When people can directly vote on a ballot that is in a language that they are more familiar with, it just demystifies the whole process.\n\nThe Berkeley survey found that, among limited-English speakers who lacked access to translated election materials or were unsure if it was provided, 87% said they would be more likely to vote in future elections if they received a ballot in their preferred language. A similar number said receiving those translated ballots would make it easier for them to vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poll surveyed 6,474 registered voters throughout California from June 2-6."

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  The Trump administration is revoking the terrorism designation of a group led by Syrias new president as part of a broader U.S. engagement with the transitional government since the ouster of former leader Bashar Assad late last year.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the move, which will take effect Tuesday, recognizes the positive actions taken by the new Syrian government under President Ahmad al-Sharaa.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Federal Register published an advance notice, which said Rubio made the decision on June 23 in consultation with the attorney general and treasury secretary.\n\nThe decision had not been previously announced, although it was made as the Trump administration has been moving to ease or end many U.S. sanctions that had been imposed during Assads rule.\n\nThe step looks to further end Syrias isolation since a lightning rebel offensive ousted the Assad family from decades of rule and give the new government a boost as it tries to rebuild a country shattered by 13 years of civil war.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in May. @PressSec / via X\n\nPresident Donald Trump, before having dinner Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, repeated that he previously had been told that Syrias new leader comes from a very tough background.\n\nI said, Well, you know, Im not that surprised. Its a tough part of the world, said Trump, who met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May. But I was very impressed by him. But we took the sanctions off because we want to give them a chance.\n\nThe brief notice offered no details about the revocation of the foreign terrorist organization designation for the al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.\n\nAl-Nusrah was originally designated a foreign terrorist organization for its previous affiliation with al-Qaida. In 2017, it split and changed its name to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which the first Trump administration added to the initial designation.\n\nSyria has been improving relations with the United States and other Western countries following the fall of Assad in December in an offensive led by al-Sharaa s group.\n\nOn June 30, seven days after Rubio signed the revocation, Trump inked an executive order ending many U.S. economic sanctions on Syria, following through on a promise he made to al-Sharaa when they met.\n\nThis FTO revocation is an important step in fulfilling President Trumps vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria, Rubio said in his statement.\n\nNetanyahu, speaking across the table Monday from Trump and Rubio, agreed that the change of leadership in Syria presents opportunities for stability, for security and eventually for peace.\n\nTheres a lot to lose by going back to conflict, the Israeli leader said. And theres a lot to gain by moving towards peace.\n\nTrumps executive order did not rescind sanctions imposed on Assad, his top aides, family members and officials who had been determined to have committed human rights abuses or been involved in drug trafficking or part of Syrias chemical weapons program.\n\nIt also leaves intact a major set of sanctions passed by Congress targeting anyone doing business with or offering support to Syrias military, intelligence or other suspect institutions.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has passed temporary waivers on those sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, they can only be permanently repealed by law."

        "content": "WASHINGTON  When Karen Pence found out that an art therapist in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico couldnt afford the clay her clients needed, she sprang into action.\n\nA trained watercolor artist and advocate of the little-known mental health profession, Vice President Mike Pences wife went to the Virginia art supply store she frequented when they lived in the state during his tenure in Congress, bought 120 pounds of self-drying clay and packed it aboard Air Force Two for their flight down to survey the damage.\n\nShe cleaned him out, the vice president said of the stores owner.\n\nMrs. Pence made art therapy her cause ever since she first learned about it more than a decade ago. She has visited numerous art therapy programs, both in the U.S. and abroad, and on Wednesday in Florida, nine months into the administration, she planned to formally announce the goals for her art therapy initiative.\n\nShe wants to help people understand the difference between art therapy and arts and crafts, and to grasp that art therapy is a viable option for treating trauma, injury and other life experiences. She also wants to encourage young people to choose art therapy as a career.\n\nI dont think that a lot of people understand the difference between therapeutic art and art therapy, Mrs. Pence, a trained watercolor artist, told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview before the announcement at Florida State University in Tallahassee. The school has an art therapy program she described as tremendous.\n\nBlabbing to a girlfriend can be therapeutic, she explained, but it is not the same as art therapy, which has three elements: a client, a trained therapist and art.\n\nREAD MORE: VP Pences wife aims to raise awareness about art therapy\n\nAs passionate as she is about raising art therapys profile, other issues help make Karen Pence tick, too.\n\nOne of them is helping military families, especially spouses. Her only son, Michael, is in the Marines.\n\nTheres also her interest in honeybees. Mrs. Pence installed a beehive on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, where the vice presidents official residence is located, to help call attention to a decline in managed bee colonies that officials say could negatively affect U.S. agricultural production. She had a beehive at the Indiana governors residence for the same reason.\n\nNow 60 and married to the vice president since 1985, Mrs. Pence has long been viewed as one of her husbands most trusted political advisers. They are often together on trips, at the White House, or at the observatory, almost always holding hands.\n\nSince returning to Washington in January (the family lived in the area when her husband served in Congress), she has accompanied the vice president on goodwill tours of Europe, Asia and Latin America, as well as trips to survey recent hurricane damage in Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. She tries to visit art therapy programs wherever she goes. Journalists who travel with Pence often keep an eye out for his wife; she often brings them cookies when he ventures back to the press cabin for small talk.\n\nREAD MORE: Devastated Puerto Rico needs unprecedented aid, says governor\n\nShes even done a little campaigning, urging Virginians to vote next month for Ed Gillespie in whats viewed as a tight gubernatorial race.\n\nIt really makes a difference, I can tell you. Nobody thought that we were going to win, she said, an apparent reference to the Trump-Pence ticket.\n\nThe vice president often refers to his wife as the familys prayer captain. She has led congregations in prayer during their hurricane-damage trips.\n\nWere people of faith so we just try and approach everything with prayer, Mrs. Pence said from her sunny, second-floor office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House complex, where she and her staff enjoy coveted views of the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. Art therapy drawings given as gifts adorn the outer office.\n\nShe proudly displayed several of her paintings, including of the Capitol dome, the vice presidents residence, a Ball canning jar-turned-flower vase, a cardinal bird and a pink peony. She turns many of her watercolors into prints and boxed notecards that she gifts to art therapists she meets.\n\nExcept for myriad pets, including two cats, a dog and a rabbit named Marlon Bundo, the Pences are empty nesters. Their son and two adult daughters are off on their own.\n\nI think for us this is a good time in our life for this role because our kids are out of college. Theyre living their own lives, Mrs. Pence said.\n\nShes also launching a blog in conjunction with Wednesdays announcement to chronicle her visits to art therapy programs."

        "content": "Olga Urbina and her son, Ares Webster, protest outside the Supreme Court in May over President Trumps move to end birthright citizenship.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday sharply limited the power of federal district judges to issue nationwide orders that block new rules or policies coming from the White House or federal agencies.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling was a procedural victory for President Trump and a setback for advocates who seek to block his executive orders in federal district courts, a tactic that has been exercised frequently to check his sweeping use of presidential power.\n\nBut the courts conservative majority did not answer the question that triggered three nationwide orders: Can Trump limit birthright citizenship, which is set out in the 14th Amendment?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe birthright citizenship issue is not before us, said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a former Notre Dame law professor who taught legal procedure.\n\nShe said the courts decision would not take effect for 30 days.\n\nHours after the decision was released, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit challenging Trumps order restricting birthright citizenship. More lawyers and state attorneys may soon file additional suits seeking a broad shield from other executive orders.\n\nSome legal experts feared that such a ruling could lead to a patchwork under which all newborns in some states would be citizens but not those in other states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh said the justices would not allow that to happen.\n\nIn my view, there should be a nationally uniform answer on whether a major new federal statute, rule, or executive order can be enforced throughout the United States, he wrote in a concurring opinion. A patchwork scheme is not workable or sustainable.\n\nHe said the justices would rule quickly to settle a constitutional dispute. Fridays ruling concerns only the power of district judges, he said.\n\nNotre Dame law professor Samuel Bray, an expert and critic of nationwide injunctions, hailed Fridays ruling but predicted it will not allow Trumps birthright citizenship order to take effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter today, the universal injunction will no longer be the default remedy in challenges to executive action, he said. Given that the birthright-citizenship executive order is unconstitutional, I expect courts will grant those preliminary injunctions, and they will be affirmed on appeal. I do not expect the Presidents executive order on birthright citizenship will ever go into effect.\n\nBarrett said these broad judicial orders arising from a single lawsuit were conspicuously nonexistent for most of our Nations history. Yet they have taken off in recent years to thwart Democratic and Republican presidents, she said.\n\nDuring the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, district courts issued approximately 25 universal injunctions, Barrett said.\n\nShe said judges have overstepped their authority. Rather deciding individual lawsuits, they too often rule broadly, she argued.\n\nFederal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch, Barrett wrote. And while judges can give full relief to plaintiffs, including groups of people, their injunctions should not be broader than necessary to shield those people.\n\nThe courts three liberals dissented.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor said the Trump administration is trying to defend a blatantly unconstitutional order repealing birthright citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew constitutional questions can be answered by resort to the text of the Constitution alone, but this is one. The 14th Amendment guarantees birthright citizenship, she said.\n\nRather than appeal that issue to the court, she said the Trump administration raised a procedural detour.\n\nThe gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the Government makes no attempt to hide it. Yet, shamefully, this Court plays along, she said. No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates. ... Because I will not be complicit in so grave an attack on our system of law, I dissent.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson saw the decision as threat to the rule of law.\n\nCourts must have the power to order everyone (including the Executive) to follow the law  full stop. To conclude otherwise is to endorse the creation of a zone of lawlessness within which the Executive has the prerogative to take or leave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would otherwise be entitled to the laws protection become subject to the Executives whims instead, she said.\n\nThe 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, says All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order disagreeing with the traditional understanding and asserting the Constitution does not extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.\n\nHe said it would be U.S. policy to not recognize citizenship for newborns if the childs mother or father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said persons birth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree federal district judges  in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington  issued nationwide orders declaring Trumps plan unconstitutional.\n\nIn quick succession, judges declared that Trumps order may not be enforced across the nation. They said his proposed restrictions violated the federal law and Supreme Court precedent as well as the plain words of the 14th Amendment.\n\nRather than challenge those rulings directly, Trumps lawyers sent an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court with a modest request.\n\nPresident Trump speaks Friday in the White House press briefing room after the Supreme Court decision on nationwide injunctions. ( Celal Gunes / Anadolu)\n\nRather than rule on birthright citizenship, they urged the justices to rein in the practice of district judges handing down nationwide orders. They have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration, they said.\n\nDuring a press briefing in which he thanked the conservative Supreme Court justices, Trump called the decision a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers and the rule of law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent months, weve seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they voted for in record numbers, he said. It was a grave threat to democracy, frankly, and instead of merely ruling on the immediate cases before them, these judges have attempted to dictate the law for the entire nation.\n\nIn practice, he said, if any one of the nearly 700 federal judges disagreed with a federal policy, they could block it from taking effect or delay it for years by tying it up in the court system.\n\nTrump said that thanks to Fridays decision, his administration can now move forward with many cases, including those about ending birthright citizenship, stripping sanctuary cities of federal funding and suspending refugee resettlement.\n\nU.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said that 35 of the 40 nationwide injunctions filed against Trumps policies came from five district courts: Maryland, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts, California and Washington state.\n\nBondi said the Supreme Court will take up the constitutionality of Trumps order limiting birthright citizenship during their next session in October.\n\nIn a news conference Friday, attorneys general from California, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts and Connecticut said the Supreme Court ruling is merely a procedural hurdle that they intend to overcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are living in a state that did not participate in this coalition of action against the Trump administration, then your rights are in question, said Washington Atty. Gen. Nick Brown.\n\nThe Supreme Court left room for district judges to decide whether a nationwide injunction is necessary, they said.\n\nNew Jersey Atty. Gen. Matt Platkin said the plaintiff states have been clear that they need nationwide relief to protect from the harms inflicted by Trumps executive order. He said they are confident the district court will agree.\n\nWe fought a civil war to address whether babies born on United States soil are, in fact, citizens of this country, he said. For a century and a half, this has not been in dispute, and we are confident that as we litigate this case, that fact will remain.\n\nCalifornia Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said he is hopeful the circuit court will see that a patchwork of state injunctions, where birthright citizenship stands for some states but not for others, will create administrative chaos and widespread confusion.\n\nWere a nation of immigrants, he said. Its our legacy and its our identity, especially here in California  home to more immigrants than any other state  including my own mom, who immigrated from the Philippines."

        "content": "Like Squid Game. Thats how residents describe it, invoking the dystopian TV show when recounting the lethal gantlet that getting aid in famine-haunted Gaza has become.\n\nIts a death race. The faster, the stronger, the luckier  theyre the ones who might survive, might reach the food, said 30-year-old Mohammed al-Shaqra.\n\nIt feels like were animals, racing for a box of supplies as if our lives depend on it. And they do.\n\nEver since Israel sidelined the United Nations and other humanitarian aid organizations late last month and tasked assistance operations to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an opaque U.S.- and Israeli-backed private contractor registered in Delaware, killing has been the near-daily companion of aid deliveries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, health authorities in Gaza said 12 people were killed near one of the foundations aid distribution centers, a relatively low toll in a week that saw 59 killed in similar circumstances on Tuesday. Since the foundation began its work May 26, more than 400 people have been killed and more than 3,000 wounded.\n\nAl-Shaqra became one of the casualties this month.\n\nOn June 8, he gathered with thousands of others early in the morning near the aid center in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. It was his third attempt to get food.\n\nI was desperate to bring something back  flour, rice, pasta, anything  for my parents, my siblings and their kids, he said.\n\nWhen the passageway to the distribution center opened, Al-Shaqra sprinted as fast as he could, hoping to beat others in the crowd and grab a box. But then an Israeli quadcopter drone  it had been buzzing overhead  started dropping explosives; the third bomb landed close to him, he said.\n\nMohammed al-Shaqra receives medical treatment inside a tented clinic at Nasser Hospital in Rafah, Gaza, on June 12.

Cradling his arm and trying to stop bleeding from his stomach, he stumbled for almost half a mile before collapsing onto a donkey cart. A kind driver took him to a field hospital for the International Committee of the Red Cross. The doctors saved his arm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe foundation came online two months after Israel cut off all aid entering into Gaza in March, justifying the blockade  despite widespread opprobrium  as a way to pressure the militant group Hamas into releasing hostages even as Palestinian authorities and aid groups reported a starvation crisis.\n\nAlthough the U.N. and humanitarian relief organizations pleaded for access to feed the roughly 2 million people in the Gaza Strip, Israel insisted Hamas was stealing aid, a claim the U.N. and other groups deny and for which Israel has never provided evidence. The alternative, the Israeli government said, would be the foundation.\n\nPalestinians flock to the aid center set up by the U.S.- and Israeli-led Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in Sudaniya, an area north of Gaza City on Tuesday. (Saeed M. M. T. Jaras / Anadolu / Getty Images)\n\nBut the group was controversial from the outset, so much so that its first pick as executive director quit before aid deliveries even began, saying the foundations plan couldnt be implemented without breaching humanitarian principles. Boston Consulting Group, which helped design the distribution system, terminated its contract with the foundation this month and fired two partners involved with the project.\n\nInstead of using humanitarian workers, the foundation has deployed armed private contractors with the Israeli military stationed only a hundred yards or so away. It also concentrated aid deliveries to what the group calls four fortified hubs in southern Gaza rather than the roughly 400 smaller centers used by the U.N. and other aid groups across the enclave  forcing already hungry people to walk for miles through active combat zones to access the deliveries.\n\nPalestinians carry food and other aid from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in Rafah, Gaza.

Its also never stated whats in the food boxes. And rather than directly handing the boxes to people, the groups workers instead dump them on pallets and watch crowds swarm over them. People gather hours in advance on safe routes designated by the Israeli military, but often find themselves under Israeli fire when allowed to approach the hubs.\n\nIts a real-life version of Squid Game. We run, then the shooting starts, we hit the ground and stay still so were not killed, then run again, said Hussein Nizar, a resident who repeatedly tried to get aid, even after his neighbor Ameen Sameer was shot in the head.\n\nI watched him die beside me, he said.

(Bilal Shbeir / For the Times)\n\nThe Israeli military has repeatedly responded to questions about killings near the aid hubs by saying it would look into reports of civilian casualties. In a previous incident, it said troops fired on people approaching them in a threatening manner.\n\nSeveral Palestinians and a foundation representative said many of the shootings occur when people run beyond the limits of the safe route in an attempt to get to the distribution site faster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if theyre not wounded or killed, many go home empty-handed, said a 28-year-old logistics worker hired by a local contractor working with the foundation.\n\nDecent people, especially the elderly and women with children, cant fight through the crowds, he said. He added that gangs also stalk people leaving the delivery area, looking to rob them and sell the precious supplies on the black market.\n\nMany of them carry knives. Its like a trap, and I see many people killed.\n\nWhen Al-Shaqra regained consciousness, he found himself in Nasser Hospital, waiting for surgery in rooms already overflowing with other casualties from that days attacks at the aid hub. Among them was his father, Wadee al-Shaqra, who was injured by a bullet that tore through the side of his abdomen.\n\nPalestinians who were injured by Israeli fire as they gathered near a food aid center await care on a bloodied floor at Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza Strip on Tuesday.

I was so happy to see him I didnt ask if he got any food. I didnt care, the father said. He added that he and his son went to the hubs despite the danger because they didnt have enough bread to share among his grandchildren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere supposed to protect them, he said. Were risking our lives just to keep them from starving.\n\nThe foundation says its efforts have been a success, touting its delivery of almost 26 million meals in the 22 days since it started operations. But with almost half a million people facing catastrophic levels of hunger and the entire population contending with acute food security, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the deliveries amount to roughly 0.6 meals per person.\n\nThe foundation does not elaborate on how it defines a meal, but it previously stated that it calculated daily rations at 1,750 calories, well below the 2,200 calories target used by humanitarian aid organizations. (The representative said recent aid deliveries provide 2,500-calorie provisions.)\n\nThe bedlam accompanying the groups distribution practices, aid workers say, was entirely predictable.\n\nPalestinians carry a wounded man after he and others headed to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid site were attacked by Israeli forces near the Sudaniya area in Gaza on Tuesday.

Jaras / Anadolu / Getty Images)\n\nDelivery of humanitarian aid can be a very straightforward operation, but its a complex one, said Juliette Touma, communications director for the U.N. agency for Palestinians, UNRWA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added that UNRWA and other groups have decades of experience serving Palestinians, with comprehensive registry lists and an orderly distribution system that assigns appointments at conveniently placed centers. The foundation aid, comprising mostly dry goods such as pasta or lentils, requires gas and water to cook, both of which are hard to procure in Gaza. The aid also does not include hygiene and cleaning supplies, she said  an essential requirement.\n\nTheres this sheer arrogance that the U.N. and humanitarians can be replaced  just like that  by a third party, a private security company. Its not at all like that, she said. Let us do our job.\n\nSaleem al-Najili, a 33-year-old nurse at the UK-Med field hospital in Deir al Balah, now dreads aid delivery times.\n\nEvery time the GHF center opens its doors, I know whats coming, he said.\n\nIt means more blood and screaming, more impossible decisions on whom we can treat. And fewer people we can actually save.\n\nShbeir, a Times special correspondent, reported from Deir al Balah. Staff writer Bulos reported from Beirut."

(via Texas Public Radio)\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPresident Trump posted letters on social media yesterday to leaders of 14 countries, informing them of his plans to impose new tariffs on their exports to the U.S. starting Aug. 1. Afterward, stocks tumbled. The president signed an executive order officially pushing back a July 9 deadline for trade deals to the new date and stated that countries can continue to negotiate with the U.S. during that time.\n\n\n\n It is possible that trading partners are wondering how serious Trump is since he keeps moving the goal posts, NPR's Scott Horsley says. The U.K. and Vietnam, two countries that have made agreements, didn't get any real tariff relief from the U.S. The uncertainty over what tariffs will be in August or next year is a brutal investment environment for importers or people looking to invest in the U.S., says Scott Lincicome, who's with the libertarian CATO Institute.\n\nSeveral prominent medical organizations in the U.S. are suing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over recent changes to federal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. The groups involved in the lawsuit include the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, and the American Public Health Association. The complaint alleges that Kennedy's decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines have endangered public health and violated federal law.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n In the 42-page complaint, the groups say Kennedy bypassed the normal process for making changes to the CDC vaccine schedule, according to NPR's Will Stone. The lawsuit claims that he didn't consult with a federal panel of experts for guidance on vaccines and failed to provide an explanation for contradicting evidence that supports vaccinating children and pregnant women. One of the plaintiffs, a pregnant physician, wishes to remain anonymous, says she's concerned she may not be able to get a COVID vaccine because of Kennedy's directives. The aim of the lawsuit is to restore the original recommendation for children and pregnant women to receive COVID shots.\n\nLiving better\n\ntoggle caption alaskla/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nLiving Better is a special series about what it takes to stay healthy in America.\n\nSeed oils are bad for you, according to Kennedy. The health secretary said vegetable oils, like canola and soybean, are poisoning Americans and driving the obesity epidemic. Kennedy points to obesity rates climbing as seed oils began to dominate the American diet as part of the evidence for his claim. Many researchers say seed oils may not be as good for you as olive oil, but the claims that they are harmful to health have been stretched too far. Check out what the science has to say:\n\n\n\n To maximize oil extraction from seeds, manufacturers often use heat and chemicals. Critics are concerned about hexane, a hazardous solvent used in refining. However, the residues are at levels too low to be toxic.\n\n A common argument against seed oils is that they promote inflammation because they contain higher levels of essential fatty acids known as omega-6s. However, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that when people consume more seed oils, they don't show increased levels of pro-inflammatory compounds in their tissues.\n\n Seed oils are prevalent in ultra-processed foods, which make up a significant portion of the U.S. food supply. Rather than focusing on which oils to consume, the focal point should be a person's overall diet, says Christopher Gardner, a nutrition scientist and professor of medicine at Stanford University.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPicture show\n\nBen Clanton\n\nPapilio is a picture book told in three parts, each highlighting a different stage of a butterfly's life (there are technically four stages for a butterfly's life, but the egg stage isn't particularly exciting). The three friends who wrote and illustrated the story felt that those three stages were the perfect way to justify the collaboration. Throughout the book, the authors, Ben Clanton, Corey R.

That paves the way for an even darker season that accentuates the shows ensemble aspect while leaning a little too heavily on blurring lines with flights of fancy.\n\nThanks to Succession, Barry wont be the highest-profile goodbye on HBO this spring, but the Emmy-nominated series isnt chopped liver either. Its fair to say, in fact, that while these episodes dont quite measure up to whats gone before, even a less-lethal Barry is still very, very good.\n\nBill Haders auteur turn as director-producer-star remains one of TVs most unpredictable series, and the new season has a strong Better Call Saul vibe to it, triggered by fallout from the seemingly inevitable fact that Haders Barry couldnt maintain his double life forever.\n\nThe consequences of his arrest flare out to both sides of that equation, from his acting teacher Gene Cousineau (as played by Henry Winkler, still a towering mixture of ego and need) and girlfriend Sally (Sarah Goldberg) to the rogues gallery of petty criminals in his orbit, including Fuches (Stephen Root) and NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan), who has improbably found love in the course of his travels, while somehow turning Barry into a four-syllable name.\n\nBarry has always wrestled with the discomfort of having a protagonist who murders people, and the question of empathizing with its namesake becomes particularly acute in these episodes with the character in prison. When Barry asks, Are you mad at me? with an almost-childlike naivete, its easy to forget, at least momentarily, some of the horrible things hes done, even if the revenge-minded Jim Moss (Robert Wisdom) cant.\n\nHader (who directed every episode) also excels at darkly comic visual gags, which are augmented in the new season with a few hysterical cameos by actual Hollywood figures, among them director Guillermo del Toro, made even funnier by how random they seem to be.\n\nThat said, the shows surreal digressions and detours into fantasy become more distracting, in a way that feels a little too precious at times. The saving grace, consistently, is the strength of the cast, even if prison creates impediments to their interactions.\n\nHBO made most but not all of the season available, and the series effectively keeps the audience on edge and guessing about where it will all end up, and how (or if) its various threads will connect.\n\nThe likelihood of a happy ending for everyone in Barry-land never seemed to be in the cards, but Hader and co-creator Alec Berg appear determined to exit on their own terms, as good (mostly) and sporadically frustrating as that might be. Thats why its hard to get mad at a show that takes such bracing creative risks, even with a season that isnt quite the stone-cold killer that it has been.\n\nBarry begins its fourth and final season April 14 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery."

He struggled to serve it out but its great to play on Centre and he thanks the crowd for sticking around at the end of a long day. Hes happy to finish with the roof open  conditions are very different with it closed  and hes happy he played that lucky backhand that helped him win in straights. Share\n\n13m ago 15.25 EDT Jannik Sinner (1) beats Aleksandar Vukic 6-1 6-1 6-3 Sinner seals it with an ace, and looks far too good to lose to anyone bar the obvious.Next for him its Pedro Martnez.

Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images Share Updated at 15.32 EDT\n\n15m ago 15.24 EDT After saving five match points, Vukic sees Sinner net and he now has break point. So he sends Sinner to the forehand corner, advancing to the net  only to be passed cross-court by an absolute beauty. I fear that may be that. Share\n\n19m ago 15.20 EDT Go on! Basilashvili, who I thought had had his moment beating Musetti in round one, breaks Sonego to stay in the match. Well now play a fourth-set breaker, while Vukic saves another match point. Share\n\n21m ago 15.17 EDT and Vukic saves two match points. The comeback starts here!

But a button-down sports shirt is still very weird gear. View image in fullscreen Photograph: Victoria Jones/Shutterstock Share\n\n35m ago 15.04 EDT Vukic is making a better first of set three, trailing 2-3 on serve, and we see footage of Sinner suffering a proper Bambi on ice moment that I guess happened when I had eyes elsewhere; in comms theyre wondering if its affecting him. Share\n\n45m ago 14.54 EDT Weve now lost 19 seeds in the mens competition  that is ridiculous, but also evidences just how deep the talent runs. Its worth noting that Sinner, Alcaraz and Djokovic still remain, and I cant see how theyre not going to be three of the four semi-finalists, but I daresay lots in the draw will be wondering if this might be their time. Share\n\n47m ago 14.51 EDT Shelton takes the first set off Hijikata 6-2, and Tauson sees off Kalinskaya 6-3 7-6(10) so faces Rybakina next. Share\n\n50m ago 14.49 EDT Thinking back to the Draper match, I guess Cilic is one of not that many left on tour used to playing the big four  and who won a slam during their era. Which is to say that he was never going to fear Draper, and perhaps the key factor in the match was his grasp of the angles of a court. Share\n\n53m ago 14.45 EDT Ah, apologies to Kasatkina, who leads Begu 6-2 4-5; Monfils does indeed serve out to lead Fucsovics 2-1. View image in fullscreen Daria Kasatkina eyes a return.

Share\n\n1h ago 14.40 EDT Its been a long journey, says Cilic. Emotions are just incredible, he says. Its been a long journey but he never doubted, and to come back to play this level in front of this crowd is incredible, and he thanks people for their sportsmanship. Hes been really dedicated all his life, and is delighted to see his three young kids in his box  theyre one of the reasons he kept his passion and he loves them cheering him on and showing him their fists. Oh man, what an effort from him to get to this moment. Share\n\n1h ago 14.37 EDT Next for Cilic, who now has the no 4 seeds path through the draw, its Jaume Munar. Hell fancy that. Share\n\n1h ago 14.35 EDT Marin Cilic beats Jack Draper (4) 6-4 6-3 1-6 6-4 An amazing win for the 36-year-old Cilic, whos battled back from dreadful injury to record what must be one of the most meaningful wins of his career. He played brilliantly today, dominating the contest then sticking in it, sending Draper chasing about while taking the centre himself  exactly how he secured the final point.

Share\n\n1h ago 14.27 EDT Righto, from 0-30 Draper makes 30-all  but Cilic wins the next two points for 5-4 while, on Centre, Sinner has broken Vukic in set two to lead 6-1 2-1. Share\n\n1h ago 14.24 EDT Ahahaha, Draper makes advantage annihilates an ace down the T, and this match is once again showing what Coach Calv told us long ago: hes born to compete at this level. Cilic leads 2-1 4-4. Share\n\n1h ago 14.22 EDT and the second when he hangs in the rally, just  he frames another one but it loops in  he goes after the next backhand, and Cilic nets! Draper is nails. Share\n\n1h ago 14.21 EDT but Draper saves the first with an ace Share\n\n1h ago 14.21 EDT Oooh, at 3-4 15-all, Draper slaps a forehand into the net, and these are dangerous times  all the more so when he frames a further forehand! Cilic has two break points, and if he converts hell then serve for the match Share\n\n1h ago 14.15 EDT Sinner secures a 6-1 first set against Vukic, and Id not be surprised if this match finishes before Draper v Cilic. Share\n\n1h ago 14.14 EDT Amazing behaviour from Cilic, who fights back from 40-0 and seizes deuce with a glorious get at the net, his pick-up sending the ball across the face to break the sideline. For all the good it does him, Draper powering through advantage to seal his hold for 3-3 in the fourth. Share\n\n1h ago 14.10 EDT Back on No 1, Cilic is, as youd imagine refusing to go away. He leads 3-2 in fourth, but is on longer dictating in the same way. Share\n\n1h ago 14.09 EDT Meantime, Sinner has taken command against Vukic, up 4-1 in the first. Hes now at that level where its hard to imagine him losing to anyone other than Alcaraz  but his potential semi with Djokovic looks tasty in the extreme. Share\n\n2h ago 14.08 EDT On 18, Monfils has just levelled with Fucsovics at a set apiece, taking the second 6-1; Tauson leads Kalinskaya 6-3 2-1; Kasatkina leads Begu 6-2 0-1; Sonego leads Basilashvili 6-1 6-3 5-4; and Ofner leads Paul 1-6 7-5 6-4 3-4. Share\n\n2h ago 14.04 EDT Jessica Bouzas Maneiro beats Sofia Kenin (28) 6-1 7-6(4) She made hard work of closing it out, missing match points, but it never seemed like she wouldnt get there in the end. Next for her is the conqueror of Coco Gauff, Daria Yastremska. View image in fullscreen Jessica Bouzas Maneiro celebrates after winning her second round match against Sofia Kenin.

View image in fullscreen August Holmgren throws his racket as he celebrates winning against Thomas Machac. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images Share Updated at 14.32 EDT\n\n2h ago 14.01 EDT Up a mini-break at 4-2, Bouzas Maneiro nets when she shouldnt; shes struggling to get this won, but an error from Kenin restores her advantage at 5-3. Share\n\n2h ago 13.59 EDT On Centre, Sinner and Vukic are under way; the world no 1 leads 2-1, on serve. Share\n\n2h ago 13.58 EDT Obviously I big her up, then shes broken back; Bouzas Maneiro, now dead to me, and Kenin, are playing a second-set tiebreak. Share\n\n2h ago 13.57 EDT Draper and Cilic swap holds at the start of set four and the crowd are into the match now. One of the things I most like about Draper is his composure under pressure; his certainty that he can do what it takes to win any match, and this is what were seeing here. View image in fullscreen A Jack Draper fan gets their acrostic game on. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Share Updated at 14.14 EDT\n\n2h ago 13.54 EDT Holmgren and Machac have done what looked entirely possible several hours ago: set up a fifth-set match tiebreak. Share\n\n2h ago 13.53 EDT On 2, Bouzas Maneiro is serving for the match against Kenin at 6-1 5-4; shes growing into a really fine player, the 0 and 1 hiding she gave Emma Navarro in Paris one of my favourite performances of the tournament. I think shes made of the right stuff mentally too, and Im interested to see how she grows from here. Share\n\n2h ago 13.50 EDT A second serve ace raises set point at 40-30, a shanked return secures it, and Draper is at base camp. I said earlier that, win or lose, he might well come to view this as a seminal contest in his career, and I was talking about a mental and tactical context. But the emotional is just as important, and the backing Andy Murray got when playing at home was not just a reflection of him going deep at Wimbledon, but of the memorable evenings he gave us all when he was developing. This could be one of those for Draper. Share Updated at 13.56 EDT\n\n2h ago 13.46 EDT I wonder if Draper thought hed just play his normal game and win this one  a not unresonable assumption. But in this set, what hes done better is keep Cilic moving, making it harder for him to hit his spots, and he secures that break to lead 5-1 in the third. Share\n\n2h ago 13.44 EDT What colour do we reckon the colour chart calls Cilics hair, by the way? Im going for Laboratory Squirrel; while I do, the man himself saves a point for a second break point with an ace. Share\n\n2h ago 13.42 EDT OK, were back once more. Draper consolidates for 4-1 in the third; Bouzas Maneiro leads Kenin6-1 5-4 and will shortly serve for the match; Offner has just taken the third set tot lead Paul, seeded 13, 201; and Holmgren and Machac are 5-45 in the fifth. Share Updated at 13.42 EDT\n\n2h ago 13.36 EDT Yes he can! I dont know how, not because he did something wonderful, but because my net dies on me again, but every journey starts with a step, and Draper is now up a break at 3-1 in the third, Cilic by two sets to love. Share\n\n2h ago 13.33 EDT Back with Draper, he makes 0-15 with a terrific forehand cross, soon arrives at 0-40, but Cilic quickly saves the first two break points. Can Draper convert the third? Share Updated at 13.36 EDT\n\n2h ago 13.31 EDT In her post-match interview, Swiatek recalls a defeat to McNally at Roland Garros as her most painful as a junior  citing that in victory is one reason shes a champion. She likes McNally and her family, who make you feel like youre not rivals, so shes glad to see her back and fit. She took confidence from how she played in Bad Homburg before coming to Wimbledon, though the courts arent similar, and she doesnt mind playing a long match today as it gave her more time on Centre Court. Otherwise, back to her towel-snaffling antics, she says its not as much fun now everyone knows shes doing it, but all her team have one so theyre happy. Share"

        "bias": "",
        "content": "If you want to get a sense of what Mahatma Gandhis famous poverty is the worst kind of violence quotation means for the U.S. today, there are two stories from this past week you should read. One is from Jonathan Cohn, the Huffington Posts ace health care reporter. The other is from Margaret Lyons, Vultures insightful television critic. Taken together, these two pieces offer a decent sketch of how Americas economy and its culture work together to relentlessly make poor people feel like shit.\n\nLets start with Cohns piece, which takes a look at a new study from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The study is based on five years worth of results from an in-person survey run by the National Health Interview Survey and, as Cohn writes, it demonstrates, in vivid terms, something that public health experts have known for a while. Namely, that the closer you are to being poor, the higher the chances are that youre suffering from what the public health field calls serious psychological distress  something of a catchall term for common forms of mental illness.\n\nThe difference isnt small, either. Nearly 9 percent of people with incomes below the poverty line (around $20,000 for a three-person family) said they suffered from serious psychological distress. That means that between 2009 and 2013, the years during which the survey was conducted, nearly one out of 10 of these people  and there are more than 40 million of them  felt debilitating levels of anxiety and depression. In contrast, barely more than 1 percent of those whose incomes exceeded the poverty line by four times or more said they felt similar mental anguish.\n\nIf youre someone who thinks depression and anxiety are just fancy words for the blues  and nothing that a good pep-talk and yank at the ol bootstraps cant fix  you might not find this too upsetting. But before you dismiss this is as little more than airy talk from the usual bleeding hearts, you should keep two things in mind. One: your view of mental health is not only antiquated, but is increasingly the last refuge of folks in denial about their own needs. Two: theres a growing body of research showing that povertys harms are just as severe cognitively as they are psychologically.\n\nAs Cohn notes, though, the CDC studys findings, while stark, dont tell us much about cause and effect. Are these people suffering from mental illness because theyre poor? Or are they poor because theyre suffering from mental illness? [M]ost researchers, Cohn writes, believe the process works in both directions. Recall all of those studies from the worst years of the Great Recession, the ones finding that being unemployed for a long time can be more devastating to your emotional health than the death of a spouse. These processes can work together to create what Cohn calls a vicious, downward spiral.\n\nSo thats the internal, quiet life of misery and desperation that Americas version of capitalism bestows upon so many. Bad as it is, however, American pop culture apparently believes its still not bad enough. And thats where Lyons piece, which examines The Briefcase, an odious new reality show from CBS, steps in. Because what The Briefcase does is tell the people who are unfortunate enough to not only be poor but also to be watching CBS that this mental anguish is, ultimately, something theyve brought upon themselves.\n\nHeres the premise of the show, as Lyons explains it. A family dealing with what CBS euphemistically calls financial setbacks is given a briefcase full of $101,000. They are then shown another financial setbacks-plagued family and are told they must decide how much of the cash to share  if any. Unbeknownst to either family, this alienating setup is presented to both. Lyons writes that in the early episodes sent to critics, the families find their responsibility to be so great as to cause one woman to vomit and several to say its the hardest decision theyve ever made.\n\nHow do they make such a decision? By engaging in a time-honored American tradition of separating the poor into two, mutually exclusive categories: those who deserve to be poor, and those who dont. The families visit each others homes and look through each others bills, Lyons writes. Maybe they could afford to pay for their childrens surgery, if only they switched from Cheerios to Frosted Flakes! Essentially, CBS has decided Ronald Reagans stories about welfare queens and young bucks using welfare to buy Ferraris may not be technically true  but theyre true enough for reality TV.\n\nLyons calls this altruism pornography, but I think even that gives CBS  and the culture that allows the suits at the network to believe The Briefcase could be the next Extreme Makeover: Home Edition  too much credit. Altruism pornography would involve episode after episode of charitable, kind-hearted giving. Whats happening here is much more dehumanizing, and requires much more of a buy-in on the part of its victims. Its not porn; its The Hunger Games. And in its own way, its no less violent."

The U.N. has called the actions taken by Myanmar forces against the group a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\n\nA report released by Amnesty International on Wednesday documents widespread rape, killings and burnings of Rohingya across the Rakhine State in Myanmar. The report includes extensive interviews of Rohingya refugees who tell stories of live burnings, sexual violence and mass shootings at the hands of soldiers.\n\nTo escape persecution, Rohingya refugees are fleeing in droves to neighboring Bangladesh, a country described by some as a reluctant host for the thousands of refugees behind its borders. Conditions within Bangladesh show refugee camps beyond capacity, as organizations struggle to keep up with humanitarian aid.\n\nFind out more: Rohingya Muslims have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since 1982, though theyve lived in the area since the 12th century. They are not considered one of the countrys official ethnic groups. As such, their lack of official identity bars them from government services and travel.\n\nOfficials from Myanmar, a majority Buddhist state, claim Rohingya are actually immigrants from Bangladesh to justify their exclusion of the group. This most recent burst of violence comes from Myanmars crackdown following clashes with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). After the government declared ARSA a terrorist organization, the retaliation escalated into hundreds of Rohingya villages.\n\nWhere to give: BRAC, a top-ranked NGO based out of Bangladesh, is scaling up humanitarian efforts for clean water, health, sanitation and child care for refugees from Myanmar. You can learn more about their efforts here.\n\nAn emergency appeal was made by the Disasters Emergency Committee for immediate crisis relief funds. DEC distributes funds to 13 member aid organizations.\n\nUNHCR, UNICEF and Save the Children have donation pages dedicated to the crisis, as does the International Rescue Committee. CNNs Public Good page provides a user-friendly resource to find NGOs that match your giving goals.\n\nTo give to starvation relief, try Action Against Hunger or the World Food Programme.\n\nBe sure to research organizations receiving your financial contributions, not only to find the best organization aligned with your goals, but also to avoid potential scams.

But now, with Trumps realignment of the countrys global position, there is a sense that Europeans are going to have to respond accordingly in a world where they can no longer believe they can count on America as an ally.\n\nJoining staff writer at The Atlantic and guest moderator Franklin Foer to discuss this and more: Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times; Jonathan Karl, the chief Washington correspondent at ABC News; Ashley Parker, a staff writer at The Atlantic; Nancy Youssef, a national-security correspondent at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWatch the full episode here."

        "content": "Editors Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. Were looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN \n\nIn 1917, British analysts deciphered a coded message the German foreign minister sent to one of his countrys diplomats vowing to begin unrestricted submarine warfare and seeking to win over Mexico with a promise to reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona if the US entered the world war. When it became public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the conflict against Germany.\n\nNever before or since has so much turned upon the solution of a secret message, wrote David Kahn in his classic 1967 history of secret communications, The Codebreakers. The Germans had taken great pains to keep their intentions confidential, and the codebreakers in Londons Room 40 had to do a lot of work to decipher the telegram.\n\nTheir efforts stand in stark contrast to the ease with which secrets came tumbling out of a Pentagon intelligence network when 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard cyber specialist Jack Teixeira allegedly posted hundreds of documents on a Discord chatroom known as Thug Shaker Central. The disclosures likely wont start a war, but they could prove extremely damaging to the US and several of its allies, including Ukraine.\n\nClay Jones\n\nTeixeira is one of more than one million people who have Top Secret clearance. The Pentagon has already started taking steps to limit the number of people who have access to such sensitive information, wrote Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat and Obama administration official. But much more can be done.  Why do so many people, especially those working short stints in government, have access to information that can shape the fate of nations and their leaders?\n\nWriting in the Financial Times, Kori Schake saw some good news.\n\nWhile specific details will be incredibly valuable to Russia and other adversaries, these are not bombshell revelations: journalists had already reported Ukrainian ammunition running low; peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv were never likely; allies have long been aware that the US eavesdrops on them; and the disparaging assessment of Ukraines forthcoming offensive may prove no more accurate than previous predictions were. These will not prove as damaging as the Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning disclosures.\n\nBut, she warned, Technology making data ever more portable, distribution more global and communications more bespoke will make it easier to amass information and distribute it  either privately or publicly.\n\nDick Wright/Cagle Cartoons\n\nBack in the House\n\nNick Anderson/Tribune Content Agency\n\nIn less than a week, the two Democrats expelled from the Tennessee House for their participation in a gun control protest were sent back to office by local officials.\n\nWriting for CNN Opinion, Rep. Justin Pearson noted, This should be a chastening moment for revanchist forces in Tennessees legislature and across the country. Over the long haul, the undemocratic machinations employed to oust us from office are destined to fail. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. Events this week demonstrated, more than ever, that this is indeed the case\n\nOver two-thirds of Americans  including four out of 10 Republicans  support the kind of common sense gun safety laws that Rep. Jones, Rep. Johnson and I were protesting in favor of, in the wake of the senseless March 27 Covenant School massacre.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd yet, calls for common sense gun reform measures fall on deaf ears in our legislature where a Republican supermajority is wildly out of step with most peoples values.\n\nThe politics of gun control have shifted, argued Democratic strategist Max Burns. The NRAs internal struggles have weakened its influence while Democrats in office, who once feared touching the issue of guns, are increasingly speaking out. And they are making some progress in enacting new state laws, Burns noted.\n\nThe American people decisively support Democratic proposals for addressing the scourge of gun violence. Political watchers who criticized Democrats for talking too much about abortion during the 2022 midterm elections later ate crow after that once-dreaded culture war topic topped the list of voter concerns nationally\n\nBiden and the Democrats have the rare opportunity to build yet another winning coalition out of an issue once viewed as political poison.\n\nTop court calls a halt\n\nBill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court issued an order that temporarily ensured access to a key drug used in many medication abortions. The move gave the justices more time to consider the issue after a Texas federal judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administrations approval of the abortion pill 23 years ago.\n\nIf abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill  reportedly used in more than half of abortions in the United States  will be severely undercut, wrote Michele Goodwin and Mary Ziegler.\n\nBeyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions dont like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists are using junk science to bypass the will of the American public and restrict abortion\n\nThere are no grounds for challenging mifepristones approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review  more than four years  before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use than Viagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident in Europe.\n\nImprisoned\n\nIn 1986, Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow bureau chief for US News & World Report, was seized by Soviet authorities and locked up in Lefortovo prison. He was the last American journalist to be arrested in Russia before last months detention of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich, who like Daniloff, speaks Russian fluently. Gershkovich has been charged with espionage but US officials have concluded that he was wrongfully detained.\n\nAs David A. Andelman noted, Daniloffs detention in prison lasted for 13 days before he was put under house arrest and then eventually swapped for an accused Soviet spy. In a conversation with Andelman, Daniloff recalled his reaction when he was imprisoned. I felt claustrophobic, and I felt like I wanted to get out of there immediately. Of course, there was no chance of that. The door slams, and you have all these thoughts and feelings that run through you, and then you settle down and you realize youre going to be hanging around that cell for some time.\n\nGershkovichs family in Philadelphia received a letter, handwritten in Russian, from the reporter Friday.\n\nI want to say that I am not losing hope, he noted. I read. I exercise. And I am trying to write. Maybe, finally, I am going to write something good.\n\nMrs. Maisel\n\nThe Amazon series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel returns this month for its fifth and final season  and David Perry is here for it. The series brings back memories of visiting his grandparents Irma and Mordy in their tiny rent-controlled Greenwich Village apartment, an experience that helped shape his Jewish identity.\n\nAs a Jewish historian, Perry wrote, I worry about the tension between preserving the memory of past hardships while not locking our entire history into a tale of oppression. The moments of peace and joy are as vital as the moments of violence. In fact, its the periods of peace, of success, of interfaith community, that reveal the terrible truth about the violence: it wasnt inevitable. People could have made different choices\n\nA show like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel lets me revel in my personal New York Jewish heritage while also getting a little break from all the worry. Its a warm, funny, sexy, extremely Jewish . comedy that hits me straight in my glossy childhood memories. That isnt to say the show isnt also problematic  it most certainly is.\n\nJane Goodalls answer\n\nIn the latest installment of CNN Opinions Little Kids, Big Questions series, 10-year-old Ronan wonders if animals are capable of being smarter than humans. With the help of the John Templeton Foundation, which is partnering on the project, the answer came from Jane Goodall, world renowned for her work with chimpanzees.\n\nOne of the attributes of intelligence is the ability to think and solve problems. In the early 1960s, I was told that this was unique to humans, and only we could use and make tools, only we had language and culture, Goodall said. But more and more research has proved that many animals are excellent at solving problems. Many use tools, and many show cultural differences. Some scientists believe that whales and dolphins are communicating with what may be a real language.\n\nAlthough the difference between humans and other animals is simply one of degree, our intellect really is amazing. bees can count and do math, and that just shows how much we still have to learn about animal intelligence. But humans can calculate the distance to the stars.\n\nAbbott and Carlson\n\nNick Anderson/Tribune Content Agency\n\nEarlier this month, a Texas jury convicted Daniel Perry of murder for fatally shooting a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020. The jury deliberated for 17 hours and decided Perrys action couldnt be excused under the states stand your ground law. Prosecutors argued Perry had instigated the incident and they introduced into evidence messages that suggested the shooting was not a spur-of-the-moment act but a premeditated one.\n\nOn the evening of the jury verdict, Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticized the decision and told viewers he had invited Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the show to ask if he would consider pardoning Perry. Others on the right called for Abbott to issue a pardon, and the governor soon responded with an announcement that he would do just that, as long as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended that Perry should be granted one.\n\nTrial verdicts are determined by judges and juries, wrote Dean Obeidallah. What Abbott is doing is not just wrong, its dangerous. His pardon, when it comes, is not what the rule of law looks like.\n\nWhat DeSantis and Biden have going for them\n\nChristopher Weyant/Cagle Cartoons\n\nTwo of the likeliest candidates for president in 2024 havent officially committed yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden says he intends to run again but has delayed making a formal announcement. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is making all the moves a presidential contender usually makes, including hawking his new book and visiting New Hampshire, but he hasnt joined fellow Republicans including former President Donald Trump, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson in declaring.\n\nDeSantis, who was neck and neck with the former president just a few months ago, may have lost a step or two in more recent polling. But his track record of successful governance in Florida should force GOP voters to think long and hard about what version of their party they want to put forward, observed Patrick T. Brown.\n\nA third Trump presidential nomination would indicate that Republican primary voters may prefer style over substance. But if they are serious about not just making liberals mad but advancing actual policy, GOP voters should consider other names, starting with the Florida governor.\n\nEven without an official announcement by the president, wrote Julian Zelizer, the Biden-Harris campaign is very much under way. By choosing to lie low while Republicans are gearing up for 2024, Biden is employing his version of what has become known as the Rose Garden Strategy, whereby the incumbent campaigns by focusing on the business of being president and showing voters that he is the responsible figure in the race.\n\nThe presidents understated strategy makes room for Republicans to stoke chaos, tear each other apart and make unforced errors while he remains above the fray for as long as possible. This strategy makes the GOP the focus of the election, allowing Biden to reinforce his message from 2020: do voters want someone who will govern and act in a serious manner or do they want a circus?\n\nDont miss\n\nGene Seymour: I am betting on Cousin Greg. But I am not a serious person (Spoiler alert)\n\nFrida Ghitis: Amid fallout of Macron-Xi meeting, another world leader tries his luck\n\nMichael Bociurkiw: How the battle for Bakhmut exposed Russias meat-grinder\n\nPeggy Drexler: Sen. Dianne Feinsteins dilemma is a reminder of this universal question\n\nChristopher Howard: The overlooked problem with raising the retirement age for Social Security\n\nElliot Williams: The justice system Trump and other white-collar defendants see is different than what most accused criminals get\n\nPhoebe Gavin: The hard lessons I learned the first time I was laid off\n\nMeg Jacobs: Air celebrates those who do the hard work and get rewarded\n\nAND\n\nSaner air travel\n\nJill Filipovic recently took a domestic flight in South Africa. Passengers and airport staff alike were friendly and polite. The airplane seat offered enough room for both of my legs and both of my arms. We took off on time and landed early. My shoes stayed on the whole time I was at the airport.\n\nIt was a vivid reminder of whats possible in air travel  and of whats usually lacking.\n\nTake the security system: More than 20 years after Sept. 11, 2001, only passengers who pay for the privilege can avoid removing their shoes and laptops from their bags by submitting their personal information ahead of time and undergoing background checks.\n\nFilipovic added, Admittedly, I do pay  I dont want to wait in a long security line, walk my stocking feet through a metal detector and have to un- and re-pack the MacBook Ive carefully crammed into my carry-on. But the existence of pay-to-play shorter-line security options like Clear and TSA Pre-Check make clear that it is indeed possible to pre-screen a critical mass of passengers to avoid the morass of cranky people trying to pull on their shoes while re-packing their electronics."

        "content": "For many Angelenos, the spectacle of armed federal agents  faces hidden behind neck gaiters and balaclavas  jumping out of unmarked vans to snatch people off the streets presents a clear threat to public safety.\n\nAs federal immigration agents have ratcheted up enforcement raids, arresting and detaining anyone they suspect of violating immigration laws, critics warn that their tactic of masking  particularly when wearing plain clothes and no visible marker of identity  spreads fear and panic across communities and imperils citizens as well as immigrants without legal status.\n\nIts very dangerous, said Scott Shuchart, who worked for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from 2022 until January of this year as an assistant director for regulatory affairs and a policy counselor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf somebody comes up to you with a mask and a T-shirt and no badge, why would you think that they are exercising a legitimate authority, as opposed to being a violent criminal trying to do you harm? Shuchart said. How do you know that you need to not resist to avoid arrest, as opposed to resist arrest to possibly survive the encounter?\n\nBut defenders of federal immigration agents also cite security as a reason for masking.\n\nThey present immigrants without legal papers as a threat to public safety, even though the majority of people ICE arrested across L.A. in early June had no criminal record . They also argue that masking is necessary because a convergence of factors  supercharged political rhetoric, more sophisticated facial recognition technology, and increased threat of doxing on social media  makes the job more dangerous for agents in the field.\n\nWe have a lot of agents whose faces are being put on social media platforms across the country, said Mathew Silverman, national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Assn. We have politicians right now that are saying, We will find these federal agents who have masks on. We will expose them. Its just creating an era in law enforcement where trying to do the jobs of law enforcement is becoming more and more difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics of law enforcement tactics say masking does not make officers safer and only escalates tension. Some argue federal agents operate under no greater threat than local officials.\n\nRegular police officers operate every day with their faces uncovered and their badge numbers visible, and its not considered unsafe for their identities to be available to people in the public, said Stuart Schrader, a history professor at John Hopkins University.\n\nI think its clear that agents are trying to create a certain spectacle of intimidation and lack of democratic control, he said. By anonymizing themselves, theyre indicating that they are not accountable to any sort of public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, a coalition of 18 states including California threw their support behind a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of many recent ICE raids in Los Angeles, calling on a federal court to issue a temporary restraining order against such operations while their legality is challenged in court.\n\nThe secretive approach taken by immigration agents as they conduct unlawful suspicionless stops has not only created a culture of fear, but has also needlessly impeded local law enforcement, the filing argued.  Because their vehicles and uniforms are not clearly marked  and their tactics can be highly aggressive  the public cannot easily discern who is a federal law enforcement agent and who may be a criminal. ... The confusion and distrust sown by defendants unlawful law enforcement practices has thus compromised public safety.\n\nFederal immigration agents stage outside Gate E of Dodger Stadium in June. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIs masking required?\n\nAs the Trump administration has set a new goal of arresting 3,000 unauthorized immigrants a day, officials say they have not introduced any new policy requiring agents to obscure their identity.\n\nRules havent changed on masks, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told The Times.\n\nLast week, U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi suggested at a Senate subcommittee hearing that she did not know plainclothed agents were concealing their faces while conducting arrests. But Bondi also seemed to justify masking, saying that officers, and their families, were being threatened and doxxed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can assure you that if theyre covering their faces now, its to protect themselves, she said. But they also want to protect all citizens.\n\nIs masking legal?\n\nThe U.S. Constitution has no prohibition against masking and no federal law forbids federal law enforcement personnel from wearing masks.\n\nIts perfectly legal, said Edward Obayashi, a Northern California deputy sheriff, special prosecutor and use-of-force expert.\n\nDHS regulations require immigration officers to identify themselves during an arrest as soon as it is practical and safe to do so.\n\nCalifornia state law is more specific, requiring uniformed officers to wear a badge, nameplate, or other device which bears clearly on its face the identification number or name of the officer.\n\nIn California, we are not going to mask ourselves, Obayashi said. We dont mask our identities, particularly on patrol. Were in uniform. Its just common sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat have Trump administration officials said about masks?\n\nActing ICE Director Todd Lyons has defended the practice of federal officers concealing their identity.\n\nIm sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, he said in early June. But Im not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, their family on the line because people dont like what immigration enforcement is.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News , Lyons said it was not right for agents to be demonized, called modern-day Nazis.\n\nDHS recently stated that ICE officers and federal agents conducting enforcement operations had experienced a 700% increase in assaults. The federal agency declined requests from The Times for raw numbers and details of assaults against ICE agents; Fox News reported ICE had recorded 10 assault events from Jan. 21, 2024, to June 30, 2024, versus 79 assault events over the same time span this year.\n\nSome argue that federal agents have become spooked in recent years as the threat of doxxing  not just to them, but their families  has magnified.\n\nJohn Q. Citizen out there is taking videos of this agent and posting it on social media, Silverman said. The picture of this agents posted, then their address is posted. Its go over to this house and protest in front of this persons house. Oh, this person has a 15-year-old son. That son goes to this school. ... Thats extremely scary for these agents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal agents were also donning masks to prevent jeopardizing future undercover operations, Silverman said. If a mass of agents conducted street operations without covering up, he argued, their faces could be captured on camera and broadcast on the internet in a way that could make them vulnerable to criminals for years to come.\n\nThere is facial recognition now that criminals are using as well, Silverman said. So now they get my face on there, and five or 10 years down the line, they pull me onto facial recognition and boom! Wait, this guy was a law enforcement officer.\n\nWhat precedents are there for U.S. federal agents adopting widespread masking?\n\nMost experts agree that the long-standing custom in the U.S. is for law enforcement officers to wear uniforms and recognizable insignia.\n\nMasks have long been used by immigration agents to protect their identities during sensitive undercover operations, such as a directed raid on a dangerous drug house or cartel, Silverman said. But typically they were not used in regular patrols or in any widespread manner.\n\nAn FBI SWAT team poses for a photo at the 1994 World Cup in Secaucus, N.J. (Remi Benali / Getty Images)\n\nOver the years, individual law enforcement officers have frequently pushed the boundaries of what people might consider acceptable legal standard practice, Schrader said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBIs Counter Intelligence Program of the 1950s and 60s, he said, was considered a particular black mark on federal law enforcement because of its covert and illegal activities, such as violating peoples constitutional rights, engaging in violence and conducting secretive operations for political reasons.\n\nThe big difference here is that this is all happening in broad daylight, Schrader said. This is happening totally in the open.\n\nHow does law enforcement masking change the relationship between citizens and law enforcement?\n\nMany civic leaders across metro L.A. say the practice of masked federal agents has sowed confusion in their communities.\n\nWe are receiving questions like, How can I know if the masked man detaining me is ICE or a kidnapper? And, Who can protect me if a masked man with a gun refuses to identify himself? Burbank Mayor Nikki Perez said recently.\n\nIn Burbank, fears of impostors turned into reality when two masked men stopped a woman outside the Mystic Museum in Magnolia Park, Perez said.\n\nAccording to the Burbank Police Department, the men got out of a white SUV, stopped a woman and, impersonating federal immigration agents, asked her for her papers. Thanks to witnesses, Perez said, the woman was able to leave without further harassment or, worse, kidnapping.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did not leave our community, though, or our residents, is a newfound sense of fear and uncertainty of safety for everyone in our community, regardless of their immigration status, Perez said.\n\nCould lawmakers require federal agents to wear masks?\n\nSome members of Congress are pushing the No Masks for ICE Act , a federal bill that would prohibit ICE agents from using face coverings during operations , except for specific safety reasons. It would also require agents to wear visible identification that clearly displayed their name and agency affiliation.\n\nBut a Republican co-sponsor has yet to get on board. Until that happens, it has little momentum in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nIn Sacramento, Democratic legislators have introduced the No Secret Police Act, a bill that would require officers operating in California to provide clear identification and prohibit them from masking.\n\nBut a state law could not control the behavior of federal officers, said David Levine, a professor of law at the UC San Francisco. Even if California passed that, he said, it wouldnt affect the immediate issue of what ICE chooses to do.\n\nSome experts who defend masking say they think every federal agent should display clear identification for everyones safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefinitely, 100%, a badge needs to be visible, Silverman said, adding he would support federal requirements for agents to show identification. Same thing with marking. ... It doesnt matter what agency youre in, you should be able to be identifiable.\n\nIn an age when anyone can order a DEA patch or FBI hat, Silverman said it is vital that agents are identifiable.\n\nWhat Im scared of is somebodys gonna think that a federal agent is impersonating, but its gonna be a real agent, he said. Or vice versa.\n\nWhat could happen if there was a clash with a masked federal agent?\n\nLevine said he would like to see Bondi, the nations top government lawyer, treat the matter of identification seriously and write an advisory letter to federal agents with clear guidelines on badges, uniforms and masking.\n\nSomebody is going to make a mistake because of this, Levine said. Somebodys gonna get shot or killed  and it may well be an officer.\n\nIf someone were to pull out their weapon, Levine said, it would be pretty easy to say, I felt threatened  particularly in a state that allows concealed carry and has a Stand Your Ground law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey could say, I thought I was under attack. I had no idea they were the police. They jumped out of an unmarked vehicle. Nobody had a badge on. Nobody was wearing a uniform.\n\nIf a masked officer with no uniform or identification were to injure, or even kill, someone in a struggle, California officials would not be able to bring criminal charges.\n\nNo state prosecutor can bring charges against a federal officer, Obayashi said. They cant even bring state charges for excessive force."

        "content": "Elon Musk is targeting federal agencies, slashing workforces, and crippling programs that support millions of people around the world. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic join to discuss how Musk and President Donald Trump are carrying out plans to purge thousands of employees from the federal government.\n\nThis week the Trump administration dismantled USAID, the worlds single largest humanitarian donor. USAID has the thought leadership, the technical ability, to run aid programs at a large scale that nobody else has, Anne Applebaum said last night. Removing the agency means probably the collapse of food-aid programs across Africa, probably the collapse of aid to help refugees. USAID runs vaccination programs for children all over the world; it will mean children will not get polio vaccines.\n\nThe takedown of USAID may also have an effect on the ongoing war in Ukraine, Applebaum explained. The agency has a role in restarting the Ukrainian energy grid, as well as in helping provide seeds and technology to Ukrainian farmers. USAID thinks not only in terms of humanitarian aid, it also thinks more broadly about economics, she continued. Ukraine plays a big role in world food production; they want Ukrainian farmers to be back working.\n\nWith Musk leading the takedown of USAID, its a test case for Can agencies just be abolished without Congress having any say? but its also a test case in cruelty, Applebaum said. Are Americans willing to accept a high level of cruelty and death just on the presidents whim?\n\nMeanwhile, pushback among Democrats has been limited. Democratic strategists are warning [the party] not to make this their issue because Democrats have to be saying Were making your lives better, voters, Michael Scherer said last night. If theyre seen as the party of defending a bureaucracy both [that] people dont know about [and] that helps people very far away, theyre way off their message of eggs and butter.\n\nJoining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Anne Applebaum, a staff writer at The Atlantic; Eugene Daniels, the chief Playbook and White House correspondent for Politico; Asma Khalid, a White House correspondent at NPR and a political contributor for ABC News; and Michael Scherer, a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\nWatch the full episode here."

        "content": "Wisconsin Supreme Court rules 1849 law does not ban abortion in the state\n\nThe Wisconsin State Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that an 1849 law does not amount to an abortion ban, keeping access to abortion in the state in place.\n\nA MARTNEZ, HOST:\n\nSupporters of abortion rights are celebrating a legal victory at the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The court decision didn't change abortion access in the state, but it confirmed a lower court decision that allowed abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. The case involved a law passed before the Civil War. Here's Sarah Lehr of Wisconsin Public Radio.\n\nSARAH LEHR, BYLINE: Three years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and providers stopped performing abortions in Wisconsin in fear of a law from the mid-1800s. In 2023, a lower court ruled that law didn't actually ban abortions and cleared the way for abortions up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. But as the case went to the state's highest court, that old law was still on the books. What it says is that it's a felony to intentionally destroy the life of an unborn child except to save a pregnant woman's life. That worried Madison-based OB-GYN Dr. Amy Domeyer, who says that line isn't always clear.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nAMY DOMEYER: How sick is sick enough? Many of us feared watching our patients suffer as complications threatened their health and lives.\n\nLEHR: Domeyer was among the advocates celebrating Wednesday's 4-3 decision by the state Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling. Justices said the 19th century ban is no longer in effect because it was superseded by abortion laws passed later on. Wisconsin's Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul says the high court opinion provides much-needed clarity after a long period of legal limbo.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOSH KAUL: The arguments we made have now been vindicated. But at a time when the rights of Wisconsinites and Americans are under threat, this case is a stark reminder of how important it is that we fight for our rights.\n\nLEHR: Meanwhile, Republicans are accusing the court of overstepping its authority. Speaking to reporters, the state's Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said he hadn't yet read the full decision, but...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDEVIN LEMAHIEU: I'm not even sure what weird rationale our liberal Supreme Court used to do this.\n\nLEHR: A dissenting conservative justice, Brian Hagedorn, called the ruling pure policymaking, not a reasoned judicial opinion. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, officially nonpartisan, has had a liberal majority since August of 2023. That's after Justice Janet Protasiewicz won by a wide margin after making abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign. At the time, that race was the most expensive judicial contest in U.S. history. It was surpassed just this spring when another liberal judge, who's yet to take office, beat a candidate backed by Elon Musk.\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Sarah Lehr in Madison.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DAVID ALLRED'S \"STRAY\")\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR.

        "content": "The credibility of Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been called into serious question after the Justice Department unsealed a plea deal taken by a former foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trumps campaign.\n\nThe documents revealed that former adviser George Papadopoulos attended a national security meeting in Washington D.C., on March 31, 2016, along with Trump, Sessions and others. In that meeting, Papadopoulos introduced himself, and explicitly stated in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and [Russian] President Putin.\n\nTrump tweeted a picture of the meeting the day it occurred, and he, as well as Sessions, sat at opposite heads of the table. Papadopoulos is pictured to the left of Sessions in the middle of the table.\n\nWhile both Trump and Sessions have repeatedly insisted there has been no collusion with the Russian government, Sessions has pledged this argument under oath. Sessions also led the foreign policy team of which Papadopoulos was part.\n\nI have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States, Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee in the opening statement of his second testimony on June 13. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.\n\nIf the Justice Department affidavit is true, and Sessions was in the room at the time Papadopoulos explained he wanted to arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin, there could potentially be a perjury case."

        "content": "Tom Homan, President Trumps chief advisor on border policy, in April at the White House, with posters featuring the mugshots of immigrants who had been arrested.\n\nWhen Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to unleash the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history, he said his second administration would start by going after people with criminal records.\n\nBut now, disappointed with the pace of arrests, the Trump administration is casting a wider net by targeting anyone deportable.\n\nRaids in California have taken place at courthouses, during scheduled check-ins with immigration authorities, at clothing factories, Home Depots, car washes, farms and outside churches. But officials say the state is hardly being singled out. Raids are coming for other sanctuary jurisdictions too, said Tom Homan, President Trumps chief advisor on border policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis operation is not going to end, he told The Times.\n\nAcross the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is stepping up new strategies and tearing down precedent to meet the White Houses demands. Homan acknowledged the pace of deportations had not met expectations and that while the administration still prioritizes removing those who threaten public safety and national security, anyone in the country illegally is fair game.\n\nIm not happy with the numbers, he said. We need to find these people.\n\nArrests are being made in places previously considered off limits, and the administration earlier this year rescinded a policy that prohibited enforcement actions in hospitals, schools or houses of worship. Agents who typically focus on drug and human trafficking are seeing their duties shifted to immigration enforcement.\n\nThe government is also now appealing to the public to help find and deport people in the country without authorization. The Department of Homeland Security, ICEs parent agency, released a poster on social media this week that depicts Uncle Sam urging people to call a hotline to report all foreign invaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, the National Guard and U.S. Marines were mobilized without the consent of state and local leaders  a tactic that Trump administration officials said could be repeated elsewhere. Trump claimed the deployments have been effective  Los Angeles would be a crime scene like we havent seen in years, Trump said Thursday  but local leaders have said the protests against ICE raids had not gotten out of control and that Trumps actions only inflamed tensions.\n\nAs protests reached their seventh day in Los Angeles, isolated incidents of violence lessened, though some tensions remained. Even so, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller wrote Wednesday on X that America voted for mass deportations. Violent insurrectionists, and the politicians who enable them, are trying to overthrow the results of the election.\n\nCalifornia Democrats say the enforcement actions are about retribution against the state for its policies that protect immigrant residents, as well as an attempt to distract the public from congressional Republicans attempts to pass the presidents tax-and-spending bill, which would add more than $150 billion for immigration and border enforcement. They say the president is testing the bounds of his authority and wants protests to spiral so that he can crack down further by invoking the Insurrection Act to establish martial law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvoking the Insurrection Act would allow military troops to arrest civilians.\n\nThis is about if it bleeds, it leads, said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Los Angeles). So he has created and manufactured violence so that he can have a show on the television. But other people  older people, folks who are disabled, young people  are going to be bleeding when Medicaid gets cut, when people are evicted from their homes.\n\nWhile public attention has focused on the arrests of employees, the administration says its also looking at employers who hire workers in the country illegally.\n\nIts not just about arresting illegal aliens, its about holding employers responsible too  but theres a burden of proof, Homan said. If we can prove it, then well take action.\n\nOne former Homeland Security official in the Biden administration said immigration laws could be enforced without escalating public tension. Why arent they doing [more] I-9 audits instead of just going after people? said the former official, Deborah Fleischaker, of forms used to verify an employees identity and eligibility to work in the U.S. There are ways to do this in ways that are less disruptive and calmer. They are choosing the more aggressive way.\n\nIn many ways, the current immigration crackdown reflects exactly what Trump said during the presidential campaign, when he declared that millions of people would be deported.\n\nThe new expansive approach appears to be a response to a late May meeting, first reported by the Washington Examiner , in which Miller lambasted dozens of senior ICE officials, asking them: Why arent you at Home Depot? Why arent you at 7-Eleven?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, now theyre all of a sudden at Home Depots, Fleischaker said.\n\nHoman said the agency has recently arrested around 2,000 people a day, up from a daily average of 657 arrests reported by the agency during Trumps first 100 days back in office. The increase is reflected in rising detention numbers, which have topped 50,000 for the first time since Trumps first presidency, according to TRAC, a nonpartisan data research organization.\n\nAsked about complaints of overcrowding and substandard conditions in detention facilities, Homan acknowledged some facilities are overcrowded during intake. Some of the immigrants detained in California since Friday have been transferred to other states, he said.\n\nCalifornia has been pretty stringent and they want to shut down immigration detention, he said. It doesnt mean were releasing these people. The less detention space we have in California, the more action they take in not helping us with detention beds, then well just simply move them out of state.\n\nThe work of immigration agents  sometimes hours of surveillance for a single person  can be slow. Jason Houser, who was ICEs chief of staff under the Biden administration, said law enforcement agents, when given quotas, will always find the easiest way to fulfill them.\n\nMiller, he said, knows ICE doesnt have enough resources or staff to get them to a million removals by the end of the year.\n\nHouser said thats where the military troops come in. Homeland Security officials said military personnel already have the authority to temporarily detain anyone who attacks an immigration agent until law enforcement can arrest them. Houser predicted that soldiers could soon begin handling arrests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics of the administrations tactics, including former Homeland Security officials, said the White Houses strategy boils down to frightening immigrants into leaving on their own. It costs a few hundred dollars a day to detain an immigrant; deportation can cost thousands, and some countries are reticent to accept the return of their citizens.\n\nThey arrest one, they scare 10, said one former senior ICE official. Thats a win.\n\nThe former official, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely, said thats an about-face from the Biden administration, during which agents answered to lawyers and precedent.\n\nEverything was vetted and vetted  to the detriment in some ways of the agency, the former official said. But to see them just doing whatever they want when they want, its a little stunning and its like, look at all the things we couldve done if we had that attitude. But they seem to have so little regard for consequences, lawsuits, media, public opinion  they have no constraints.\n\nHoman said protests in Los Angeles have made enforcement actions more dangerous but have not prevented agents from making as many arrests as planned.\n\nIf the protesters think theyre going to stop us from doing our job, its not true, he said. Were going to probably increase operations in sanctuary cities, because we have to."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "As he barnstormed across America, Jimmy Swaggart would prowl the stage like a born-again Mick Jagger, all swagger as he strutted, bellowed, banged on a piano, spoke in tongues and  in a pitch he perfected to a near art form  urged the faithful to double down on their relationship with the Lord by contributing to his ministry.\n\nA fire-and-brimstone Pentecostal preacher, Swaggart bragged he had more followers than Oral Roberts or Jim Bakker, lived a luxuriant life on a 100-acre compound in Baton Rouge, La., and whooshed off to evangelistic crusades in a private jet with a fleet of 18-wheelers, loaded with musical instruments and television equipment, rumbling down the highway below.\n\nBut his ministry was upended in the 1980s when photos surfaced showing Swaggart with a prostitute at a New Orleans motel and again when he was pulled over by the California Highway Patrol in the Mojave Desert while traveling with a woman who told officers she was a prostitute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefrocked and disgraced, Swaggart clawed his way back to the pulpit, but attendance at his church shrank, his television ministry withered and the Bible college he founded stripped away his name.\n\nUnbowed until the end, Swaggart died Tuesday at Baton Rouge General Medical Center after suffering a cardiac event on June 15, according to a statement from Megan Kelly, a family spokesperson. He was 90.\n\nMuch like his rock n roll cousin Jerry Lee Lewis, Swaggart was comfortable onstage and confident at the piano, working the masses into a fervor when he invited those who were physically and spiritually ailing to approach the altar, where a team of ministers would lay their hands on the worshipers to begin the healing.\n\nIf you think Miller Lite is going to carry you home, youre wrong, he howled during one service in his native Louisiana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you think the president is going to carry you home, youre wrong, he said, pausing, and then gently adding: Its Jesus Christ, thats your savior.\n\nHis brand of populist hellfire played well in the U.S. and beyond in the 1980s when The Jimmy Swaggart Telecast reached nearly 2 million viewers a week on 500 stations and his monthly magazine, the Evangelist, was shipped to more than 800,000 households.\n\nHis gospel albums sold millions, and when he hit the road, his followers would pour in by the thousands. Dan Rather once called him the most effective speaker in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI really dont look at it as success or lack of success, Swaggart told the Associated Press in 1985. Its just mostly the Lord. I feel he wants me to do what Im doing.\n\nJimmy Lee Swaggart was born March 15, 1935, in Ferriday, a small crossroads eight miles from the Mississippi River in northeastern Louisiana. It was a tired-out town of just a few thousand, but its likely that every soul there knew Swaggart, Lewis and their other cousin Mickey Gilley. The Ferriday Three, town folk called them.\n\nSwaggart said he was 8 when the Lord first spoke to him as he stood outside the Arcade Theater in downtown Ferriday, waiting to watch a Saturday matinee.\n\nI felt better inside, Swaggart said years later. Almost like taking a bath continuously.\n\nLike his cousins, Swaggart grew up with a burning desire to get out of Ferriday. He dropped out of high school, just like his cousins, and started preaching on street corners, then took a position as a pastor at a small church. The Bible had been his companion for years.\n\nBut if Lewis ascent was explosive as he rocketed to fame with Great Balls of Fire and Whole Lotta Shakin Going On, Swaggart did the Lords work in near poverty. While Lewis was earning up to $80,000 a month from record sales and concerts, Swaggart was lucky to scratch out $30 a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, Lewis bought his cousin a beat-up Plymouth and loaned Swaggart his backup musicians and studio time to record a gospel album.\n\nSwaggart finally hit the road, traveling the back roads of Louisiana and Mississippi, holding revivals. His gospel albums were good enough and his baritone voice strong enough that he settled in Baton Rouge in 1969 and started the Camp Meeting Hour radio show, a blend of gospel, dire warnings and road maps to redemption.\n\nBy the time he was 49, Swaggart had overtaken Robert Schuller and Oral Roberts as the king of television preachers, reaching 2 million households a week and appearing on more than 500 stations. The money poured in. By 1985, his ministry was bringing in roughly $120 million a year from collections, magazine sales and merchandise from his World Ministry gift catalog.\n\nThe trappings of it all were impressive: the 100-acre compound; the 7,500-square-foot house; the matching Lincoln Town Cars for his wife, Frances, and himself; the assembly hall that seated 1,000; the Bible college; the immaculately tended gardens; and the 28 relatives on the payroll.\n\nBut the higher the ascent, the greater the fall. And for the Ferriday Three, there was to be a day of reckoning.\n\nLewis had been a hell-raiser since he was a youth, and he was no different as an adult. He drank, took amphetamines and cheated on his wives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis also seemed to have a tight relationship with death. A son drowned in a swimming pool, another was killed in a Jeep accident, and his fifth wife died of a drug overdose under suspicious circumstances. His fans rolled with his excesses and pitied his life tragedies. But when he married a 13-year-old cousin, they melted away.\n\nGilley, who launched his career as a country artist but had greater success when he embraced pop, lost much of his fortune when he got into a legal dispute with his partner in a Pasadena, Texas, nightclub called Gilleys. Shuttered, the place burned to the ground in 1990 in a fire that authorities determined was arson.\n\nSwaggarts success with the collection plate occasionally raised suspicions. Former employees went to court, accusing the preacher of misappropriating donations, and lawsuits were filed against his ministry over tax exemptions and contested wills, which brought in millions.\n\nSwaggarts downfall, however, was born from a religious war of sorts that erupted in the 1980s among three pop-star evangelists  Bakker, then soaring high with The PTL Club, New Orleans preacher Marvin Gorman and Swaggart himself.\n\nSwaggart took the first swing when he went after Bakker, accusing him of having an affair with a church secretary named Jessica Hahn. Bakker was eventually expelled from the Assemblies of God denomination and was sentenced to 45 years in prison for fraud. The sentence was later reduced to eight years, and Bakker was paroled after serving just five.\n\nBut the outcome was far different when the preacher went after Gorman, who like Swaggart had an international television ministry. Swaggart accused the New Orleans preacher of having affairs with various parishioners, as well as another ministers wife. It was enough to get Gorman tossed from the Assemblies of God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncensed, Gorman sued Swaggart for defamation and won a $10-million judgment that was later reduced to $6.64 million, then finally settled out of court for $1.8 million. Gormans revenge, though, was not yet complete.\n\nSuspicious that Swaggart himself was an adulterer, Gorman asked his son to tail Swaggart one night. The son found Swaggart at a run-down motel on Airline Highway in New Orleans and took photos of the preacher checking into a room with a prostitute.\n\nGorman handed the photos over to the Assemblies of God, which ordered Swaggart suspended for two years. Uncertain that his ministry could withstand such a long break, Swaggart gave it three months and returned to the pulpit, preaching under the auspices of the Jimmy Swaggart Bible College.\n\nOn a bright Baton Rouge morning in 1988, Swaggart bounded up the steps of his worship center and  as thousands gazed on  spoke vaguely about his trying time, his burden and his struggles with Satan.\n\nWhen a women in the pews called out, Do you want some money? Swaggart smiled broadly.\n\nI sure do.\n\nThree years later, Swaggart was pulled over for driving on the wrong side of the road in the Coachella Valley. His passenger told officers that she was a prostitute and that the preacher had picked her up while cruising the streets of Indio.\n\nThis time, rather than face parishioners, Swaggart stepped down as head of his ministry in order to reflect. His son Donnie took over Sunday services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost days, Swaggart retired to his study and wrote or played the piano, singing his favorite gospel songs. During the length of his career, he wrote nearly 50 books and dozens of study guides and commentaries on the Bible.\n\nWhen he did preach, it was in a smaller church, where the gatherings would seem larger and his presence more commanding. When pressed about his sins, he was often direct.\n\nThe Lord told me its flat none of your business, he said during one prayer service.\n\nSwaggart is survived by his wife, son, three grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.\n\nTimes staff writer Grace Toohey contributed to this report."

        "content": "As the crucial summer harvest season gets underway in Californias vast agricultural regions, farmers and their workers say they feel whiplashed by a series of contradictory signals about how the Trump administrations crackdown on illegal immigration might affect them.\n\nCalifornia grows more than one-third of the countrys vegetables and more than three-quarters of the nations fruits and nuts in the fertile expanses of the Central Valley, Central Coast and other farming regions. The industry produced nearly $60 billion in goods in 2023, according to state figures  an output that depends heavily on the skilled labor of a workforce that is at least 50% undocumented, according to University of California studies.\n\nWithout workers, the juicy beefsteak tomatoes that are ripening and must be hand-harvested will rot on the vines. The yellow peaches just reaching that delicate blend of sweet and tart will fall to the ground, unpicked. Same with the melons, grapes and cherries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThats why, when federal immigration agents rolled into the berry fields of Oxnard last week and detained 40 farmworkers, growers up and down the state grew worried along with their workers.\n\nFarm laborers, many of whom have lived and worked in their communities for decades, were terrified of being rounded up and deported, separated from their families and livelihoods. Farmers worried that their workforce would vanish  either locked up in detention centers or forced into the shadows for fear of arrest  just as their labor was needed most. Everyone wanted to know whether the raids in Oxnard were the beginning of a broader statewide crackdown that would radically disrupt the harvest season  which is also the period when most farmworkers earn the most money  or just a one-off enforcement action.\n\nIn the ensuing days, the answers have become no clearer, according to farmers, worker advocates and elected officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe, as the California agricultural community, are trying to figure out whats going on, said Ryan Jacobsen, chief executive of the Fresno County Farm Bureau and a farmer of almonds and grapes. He added that time is of the essence, because farms and orchards are coming right into our busiest time.\n\nAfter the raids in Ventura County last week, growers across the country began urgently lobbying the Trump administration, arguing that enforcement action on farm operations could hamper food production. They pointed to the fields around Oxnard post-raid, where, according to the Ventura County Farm Bureau, as many as 45% of the workers stayed home in subsequent days.\n\nPresident Trump appeared to get the message. On Thursday, he posted on Truth Social that our great farmers, along with leaders in the hospitality industry, had complained that his immigration policies were taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that it was not good and changes are coming!\n\nThe same day, according to a New York Times report , a senior official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrote regional ICE directors telling them to lay off farms, along with restaurants and hotels.\n\nEffective today, please hold on all work site enforcement investigations/operations on agriculture (including aquaculture and meat packing plants), restaurants and operating hotels, the official wrote.\n\nMany in California agriculture took heart.\n\nThen on Monday came news, first reported in the Washington Post, that the directive to stay off farms, hotels and restaurants had been reversed.\n\nThere will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICEs efforts, Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement to The Times. These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\n\nIn Californias heartland, Jacobsen of the Fresno County Farm Bureau spoke for many farmers when he said: We dont have a clue right now.\n\nAsked Tuesday to clarify the administrations policy on immigration raids in farmland, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the Trump administration is committed to enforcing federal immigration law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the President is focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, Jackson said, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\n\nStill, Jacobsen and others noted, aside from the upheaval in Ventura County last week, agricultural operations in other parts of the state have largely been spared from mass immigration sweeps.\n\nWorkers, meanwhile, have continued to show up for work, and most have even returned to the fields in Ventura County.\n\nThere has been one notable outcome of last weeks raids, according to several people interviewed: Employers are reaching out to workers rights organizations, seeking guidance on how to keep their workers safe.\n\nSome employers are trying to take steps to protect their employees, as best they can, said Armando Elenes, secretary treasurer of the United Farm Workers.\n\nHe said his organization and others have been training employers on how to respond if immigration agents show up at their farms or packinghouses. A core message, he said: Dont allow agents on the property if they dont have a signed warrant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, many of the growers whose properties were raided in Ventura County appear to have understood that; advocates reported that federal agents were turned away from a number of farms because they did not have a warrant.\n\nIn Ventura County, Lucas Zucker, co-executive director of the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, a group that has often been at odds with growers over issues such as worker pay and protections, underscored the unusual alliance that has forged between farmers and worker advocates.\n\nTwo days after the raids, Zucker read a statement condemning the immigration sweeps on behalf of Maureen McGuire, chief executive of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, an organization that represents growers.\n\nFarmers care deeply about their workers, not as abstract labor, but as human beings and valued community members who deserve dignity, safety and respect, McGuire said in the statement. Ventura County agriculture depends on them. Californias economy depends on them. Americas food system depends on them.\n\nBefore reading the statement, Zucker evoked light laughter when he told the crowd: For those of you familiar [with] Ventura County, you might be surprised to see CAUSE reading a statement from the farm bureau. We clash on many issues, but this is something where were united and where were literally speaking with one voice.\n\nThe agriculture industry and farmworkers are both under attack, with federal agencies showing up at the door, Zucker said later. Nothing brings people together like a common enemy.\n\nAdvertisement"

        "content": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\n\nThe hashtag #MeToo has millions of women sharing stories of abuse, shining a spotlight on a troubling reality in our society.\n\nIt was first used in 2007, but when actor Alyssa Milano tweeted it Sunday night to talk about sexual harassment and assault in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein story, it went viral. The hashtag was tweeted nearly a million times in just 48 hours. Facebook reported 45 percent of its users have friends who posted #MeToo, as women wrote about their experiences about the workplace and culture, and what should change.\n\nWe explore some of those issues with Fatima Goss Graves. She's president of the National Women's Law Center. Lisa Senecal wrote about her own experience for the online news site Daily Beast. She's with the Vermont Commission on Women. And Melissa Silverstein is the founder of the blog and Web site Women and Hollywood.\n\nThank you all for joining us.\n\nLisa Senecal, I'm going to start with you.\n\nYou have had a personal experience with sexual harassment. That's in part what has drawn you to this #MeToo campaign movement.\n\nJust tell us briefly about what happened.\n\nLISA SENECAL, Member, Vermont Commission on Women: Sure.\n\nLike most women, I have had a number of experiences with sexual harassment, beginning with my first job, when I was 15 years old. And it's really been a threat off and on throughout my entire professional career.\n\nThe most egregious offense was an actual assault that occurred with a male executive. Unfortunately, because of an NDA  and we can go into the evils of nondisclosures another time  but because of that, there isn't a lot that I'm able to say about the specific event.\n\nBut the issue of sexual harassment and finally having this come to the fore, so many women are already familiar with it from being on the receiving end. And I think, especially with the #MeToo campaign, it's been really wonderful and an eye-opening experience for men to realize just how pervasive an issue this is."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "The humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip continues to worsen, particularly for children. Last month, UNICEF declared that the number of children being admitted to hospitals in Gaza for acute malnutrition had risen by fifty per cent between April and May. Of the 5,119 children admitted in May, 636 children have severe acute malnutrition (SAM), the most lethal form of malnutrition, the statement explained. These children need consistent, supervised treatment, safe water, and medical care to surviveall of which are increasingly scarce in Gaza today. The number of children with SAM has surged 146 per cent since February.\n\nA temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier this year led Israel to permit more aid to enter Gaza, but, since then, Israel has either cut off all aid or allowed in just a trickle. Moreover, Israel has largely replaced the previous aid-delivery system, which operated in part through the United Nations, with a new system, run by a private organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in which Palestinians are forced to trek to one of four locations to receive food. Israeli forces, and private American contractors who are guarding the sites, have fired weapons at Palestinians as they approach; more than six hundred Palestinians have been killed while collecting aid, according to the United Nations.\n\nI recently spoke by phone with James Elder, UNICEFs global spokesperson, who just returned from the Strip. Elder has previously worked in countries including Angola, Zimbabwe, Libya, and Sri Lanka. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the wounded children he spoke to in Gaza, the risks people are now willing to take in order to find food, and how parents are trying to cope with unimaginable loss.\n\nWhen were you last in Gaza?\n\nI was last in Gaza in June, and I was there for two weeks. It was my fifth mission to Gaza since the horrors of October 7th. In a typical emergency, my job is to go and see the situation, report on it, and share what UNICEF is doing. But, in Gaza, ninety-five per cent of it is to bear witness. I spend entire days in hospitals and camps simply listening to people and hearing the situation. I learned very early on in November or December of 2023 that it was much more important to spend my time sharing the grave violations that are occurring consistently to children rather than speaking about what our program is doing. In terms of whats happening, there has been a great degree of disinformation and a great degree of credibility given to statements that have been found to be completely false. So its been very important, I think, to simply bear witness, and I have met hundreds of children and families.\n\nHow would you say your visit in June was different from your previous visits, if it was different?\n\nYes, it was, even though I didnt expect it to be. It was different for several reasons. One is the wounds I saw on children. There were burns on little girls and boys, fourth-degree burns I didnt know existed. And shrapnel riddled through a body. Shrapnel is designed to go through cement, and what it does to a childs body is horrific. On one previous trip, I saw a bus of children who spent two days trying to get from the north to the south after being held at Israeli checkpoints, and I walked in the bus, and all I could smell was childrens burning flesh. It doesnt leave you. And one of the things that struck me this time was that I wasnt just seeing these childrenI was hearing them. There is such a horrendous lack of painkillers that when Id be in a hospitaland hospitals are wall to wall with people with wounds of waryoud hear the children and their screams. So I certainly noticed that as a person, parent, human.\n\nThe other thing was food and water. Whenever you have warnings of famine, there is big international pressure, and Israel loosens controls so more aid can come in. But then international pressure wanes and the restrictions are tightened again. Once you have famine, people are dying en masse. But there is starvation where a childs body is degrading and the immune system is starting to collapse, and thats happeningso childrens bodies arent waiting for that technical definition.\n\nWe are now so far below the emergency threshold for water. It is in critical shortage now, and it is controlled entirely by Israel. Since electricity to Gaza was cut after the horrors of October 7th, diesel became essential to treat and distribute water, but theres been a hundred-plus-day blockade on fuel coming into Gaza. Weve got to a point where, if that doesnt change or if the electricity isnt turned back on, which would solve a lot of problems, youll start to see children dying of thirst. Water was something that really, really struck me, because its absolutely political, not logistical. If Israel allowed fuel or turned on the power for these desalination plants, that problem would be solved. Thats a level of stress on a population I saw that I hadnt seen before.\n\nThe most lethal crisis isnt just hunger or thirstits the brutal collision of both. And those deaths are often not recorded; when children are severely malnourished, theyre eleven times more likely to die from common childhood illnesses. Theyre often not getting to a hospitalfirst because the hospitals are full of people with wounds of war, and, second, if you just look at the south, there is one fully functioning hospital, and its in an evacuation zone. Its almost impossible to get to unless youre in an ambulance, because you have to walk through an evacuation zone, which is militarized.\n\nWhat have you learned about children starving to death?\n\nStarving to death is dying of severe acute malnutrition, and there is a number, but, honestly, Im not sure how reliable it is. [The director of Gazas field hospitals told NBC News last month that more than sixty-six children had died from hunger and malnutrition since the war began.] The problem is that, for the vast majority of children, if you die, if you are severely, acutely malnourished and you die, its very unusual to have starved to death. Youve died because of diarrhea, basically, or acute watery diarrhea, which is very, very commonplace now, particularly given the restrictions on water and food. Youre killed by something that a healthy childs immune system wards off very, very easily.\n\nWhat are your conversations like with these kidss parents? Is there anger? Sadness? How would you characterize it?\n\nI would say that anger is infrequent. Theres an immense vulnerability. And theyre holding their medical-evacuation forms, meaning that they were approved for medical evacuation from Gaza. But there are thousands of children who need medical evacuation from Gaza. I mean, literally thousands. So theyre holding this piece of false hope in their hands. Theres a grace and generosity in speaking to me, but theres an absolute sadness.\n\nTheres a level of powerlessness that Ive noticed for a long time. I noticed it more than a year ago when a parent would explain to me that their child had realized that this parent could no longer protect them, and what a horrifying moment that was. These parents know that theyve lost the ability to keep their children safe, so that powerlessness cuts deep into people. You sit and you listen and you talk, and its a little girl or a little boy, and they are trying to be brave in some way, or theyre in a coma and the parents trying to. And in doing so, the parents, sometimes fathers in a very paternalistic environment, are in tears."

        "content": "A group of immigrants with temporary legal status in the U.S. is suing the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security terminated the legal protections for some 60,000 people from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal.\n\nSeven plaintiffs from the affected countries, along with the National TPS Alliance, an advocacy group, have filed the lawsuit against DHS and the agencys secretary, Kristi Noem, alleging that the terminations were, at least in part, motivated by racial animus and violated the Constitution.\n\nNicaragua, Honduras and Nepal have experienced natural disasters that have made it unsafe for their nationals to return home, leading to Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations. On Monday, the Trump administration terminated the designation for those from Nicaragua, with a DHS spokesperson saying in a news release that the status never meant to last a quarter of a century. It also terminated TPS for Honduras, with Noem similarly saying that TPS was designed to be just that  temporary. Just over a month ago, DHS terminated the designation for Nepal.\n\nThe terminations, the lawsuit said, will impose extraordinary and irreparable harm on TPS holders if the decisions arent reversed.\n\nI work in a hospital, caring for cardiac patients. Ive been doing it the right way the whole time, Jhony Silva, a Honduran TPS holder and a plaintiff in the case, said in a release from the ACLU of Southern California, one of the legal groups representing the plaintiffs. Now, I am facing losing my job, the ability to care for my family, and the only home Ive ever known.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the lawsuit ignores the Presidents constitutionally vested powers.\n\nTPS was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet thats how previous administrations have used it for decades, McLaughlin said in a statement. The Trump administration is restoring integrity to our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe. We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Noem, Trump and other officials made numerous statements against non-white, non-European TPS holders based on their perceived race, ethnicity and national origin. In many cases, the suit said, officials disparaged TPS holders as criminals.\n\nUnder Noems tenure, DHS has criticized the program for being responsible for, the suit says, allowing half a million poorly vetted migrants into this country  from MS-13 gang members to known terrorists and murderers  referring to a DHS social media post from May after the Supreme Court allowed Trump to revoke TPS from nationals of four countries. However, the suit points out, TPS is available only to those who are already in the U.S. And anyone with more than one misdemeanor conviction does not qualify for the status.\n\nThe suit also claims that the Trump administrations decision was based on predetermined political decisions and that DHS failed to give TPS holders a sufficient transition period. According to DHS announcements, TPS holders are being given 60 days before they will be stripped of their legal status and work authorizations. This means those from Nepal will have their status until Aug. 5. The lawsuit alleges that DHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act by abandoning the longstanding practice of providing a transition period of at least six months when terminating TPS designations in place for more than three years, as they were in the cases of all three countries.\n\nThis administration is forcing TPS holders  and their U.S. citizen children  to make an impossible choice, said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law & Policy (CILP), another group representing the plaintiffs. They cannot safely go back to their country of nationality, leaving their families and communities, and yet they will be stripped of the right to live and work in the U.S.\n\nWhile DHS has determined that the countries are environmentally safe to return to, critics say that the terminations could upend lives and put TPS holders in danger. The State Department has designated Nicaragua as a country Americans should reconsider traveling to, citing crime, the arbitrary enforcement of laws, the risk of wrongful detention and the limited availability of health care. Honduras has received the same designation, and the State Department recommends increased caution when traveling in Nepal because of the potential for political violence.\n\nThe lawsuit follows several others that have tried to block the Trump administrations attempts to end TPS. The National TPS Alliance, in addition to seven Venezuelan nationals, sued the administration in February after the government rescinded protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the U.S."

Not only do you get a better clean but using a bidet can also help you live a more sustainable life by cutting back on toilet paper. And thats not even mentioning the luxuries of a heated seat and dryer that will make you wonder how you ever used a normal toilet in the first place.\n\nNow that the taboo around washing your butt is finally leaving America, you might be looking for your first bidet. To help you along, Ive spent nearly four years testing and reviewing 31 of the most popular bidets on the market to find the absolute best. Here are three I love.\n\nBest bidet attachment: Tushy Classic 3.0 Bidet Attachment\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nIf youre looking for a low-cost bidet thats simple to set up, effective and not overly complicated, the Tushy Classic 3.0 is the bidet for you. Out of the attachments, the Tushy Classic 3.0 had the most comfortable stream by far, and its adjustable nozzle made it much easier than others to get a thorough clean. While its a bare-bones bidet, you still get a solid range of pressure and directional adjustability so you can find what feels right for you. With attachments in general, I found myself using low pressures, as their streams felt more aggressive than their electric counterparts.\n\nThe Tushy Classic was relatively easy to install, and the clear instructions are simple to follow, even if youre not particularly handy. However, when installing any bidet, the most important aspect is ensuring its compatible with your toilet. You should also find the water connections and try removing your toilet seat beforehand so you know how everything works. Luckily, the Tushy Classic fits all two-piece toilets and most one-piece toilets (more on this below). If youre still not sure if the Tushy will fit your specific toilet, you can find more about Tushys compatibility here and even browse through its searchable list of toilets here.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nWhile I love the Tushy attachment, theres one big caveat: I found that the method used to supply warm water to the Tushy Spa  and all the other hot-water bidet attachments I tested  wasnt effective.\n\nSince a toilet only has a cold water supply, to get warm water with a simple attachment like the Tushy, you have to hook it up to your sinks hot water supply. Theres no internal heater, so your water temperature is completely dependent on how quickly your sinks water gets hot, and even then, you still have to flush out the water thats been sitting in the hose before you get a warm wash. For that reason, I recommend you get the Tushy Classic over the Tushy Spa and avoid attachments altogether if you want to use warm water. If you prefer a heated wash, consider upgrading to a full bidet seat, like one of our top picks, the Tushy Cloud or Toto Washlet C2.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nThe Tushy Classic 3.0 is a fantastic bidet for beginners and a decent value. Of course, you could find a much cheaper option for $30 or $50, but no other bidet attachment was as comfortable to use as the Tushy. It has a gentle yet effective stream, simple installation and easy-to-use controls, along with adjustable pressure and direction. However, if you want more features such as warm water, a heated seat or a dryer, youll have to shell out some more cash, but trust me, its worth it.\n\nBest bidet seat: Toto Washlet C2 Bidet Seat\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nWhile bidet attachments are a cheap way to see if you like bidets, I think most people will be happier with a more feature-filled seat with useful functions like warm water, a heated seat and a dryer. The best bidet seat I tested with all those features was the Toto Washlet C2.\n\nThe Toto C2 stood out among its competitors for one reason: comfort. Almost no bidet I tested could match its comfortable yet effective wash-and-dry experience, which is why I think it should be the first bidet you invest in.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nThe spray of the Toto C2 uses an aerated wash that gave me the best cleaning experience out of the bidets I tried. The oscillation function on the Toto was a great way to get a fuller, more thorough clean, and it also features a front wash and pulsating feature, although I didnt find the pulsing function to add much to the experience.\n\nBeyond being effective, the Totos stream was by far the most comfortable I tested, with a thick but gentle spray that adjusts to specific levels so you can find just the right pressure. The adjustability of the Totos stream is also stellar, with small but noticeable differences between each level that help you find your perfect setting.\n\nOnce youre done with your wash, the dryer on the Toto C2  just like its spray  is best in class. It felt the most comfortable, with a wide, even dry that helped me cut back on toilet paper use. Plus, you can adjust the dryer between three heat settings to find whats most comfortable for you.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nOn top of an extremely comfortable and effective wash, the Toto also has some extra features that arent must-haves but make your bathroom experience all the more luxurious. One of these functions is a pre-mist feature, which turns on automatically when it senses someone sitting on the seat and sprays a mist onto your toilet bowl to lubricate the surface, which helps keep it clean. The deodorizer is also automatic, activating once you stand up to help your bathroom stay fresh. Other bidets also have features like these, so while theyre nice, youll probably find them on most other bidets you shop for at this price point.\n\nAll the controls for the Toto C2 are found on a mounted sidearm. Theyre quite straightforward to use, but you might need to read through the manual first to understand how to get to all the different settings. If you want a remote for extra convenience, or youre worried a bidet with an arm wont fit in your bathroom, the Toto Washlet C5 is the same as the C2 but features a remote and added user profiles for $50 to $100 more.\n\nEven though remotes sound nice, I actually like bidets with sidearms better because you dont have to worry about where the remote is or replacing batteries, and sidearms often have buttons that are labeled, unlike remotes. Bidets with remotes are also typically more expensive, so saving money by purchasing a sidearm bidet is a better value for most.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nThe Toto Washlet C2 was also quite easy to put on my toilet, and while you have to replace your seat entirely, I was surprised to find that installing electric bidet seats isnt much more complicated than installing bidet attachments like the Tushy. However, since youre taking off your existing toilet seat, be sure to figure out if your seat is round or elongated, and buy the corresponding bidet (more on this below).\n\nOne of the only real cons to the Toto C2 is how it heats its water. It uses a tank to store warm water for a wash, but if you use all the water in that tank, the temperature drops back down to the tap. Other bidets, like our value pick the Tushy Cloud, have technology that provides endless warm water, which can be critical if you like longer washes or if multiple people are using the bidet back-to-back. The Tushy Cloud and our previous value pick, the Alpha JX,2 both have this technology, so read on to see if theyre right for you.\n\nThe other main downside of the Toto C2 is the size of its seat. The tank takes up a lot of room, which means if you have a round toilet, the available sitting space is smaller than most other bidets I tested. I didnt have this problem with the elongated version, but if youre a larger person with a round toilet, you might want to consider the Alpha JX2.\n\nIf you want the advantages of a full bidet seat instead of just an attachment, the Toto Washlet C2 is the bidet for you. Its filled with the most useful features and provides a wash so comfortable and effective youll wonder how you ever relied solely on toilet paper.\n\nBest value bidet seat: Tushy Cloud Bidet Seat\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nTushy released a slew of new bidets in late 2024 and early 2025, but one stood out above the rest: the Tushy Cloud. This bidet strikes the perfect balance of features and performance, giving you the three most impactful features  a heated seat, a heated dryer and endless warm water  for $359.\n\nThis bidet was so good that it nearly dethroned the Toto from our top spot. It has everything you want from a bidet and a stream so comfortable, it rivals the Toto. So, why didnt it win? Unfortunately, the Tushy Cloud is only available in an elongated version, so folks with round toilets are out of luck. However, if you do have an elongated toilet, this is absolutely the bidet you should buy.\n\nWhat truly blew me away about the Tushy Cloud is its level of features for the price tag. Bidets that cost $500 or more often tout fancy extras like night lights, lids that open automatically and user presets, but the one feature that makes the price jump the most is coil-heated water. This technology allows the bidet to heat water that runs through the seat without a tank. That means your wash will be pleasantly warm right when you push the button and stay warm for as long as you want. Plus, since the Cloud doesnt have a tank, it doesnt look as bulky on your toilet and has more available space to sit than bidets that have to store water.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nIn previous versions of this guide, the Alpha JX2 was our pick for the best value bidet for a similar reason. It has coil-heated water for a price that wont break the bank. However, the Tushy pushed the JX2 out of the winners circle this year thanks to its superior comfort. The stream of the Tushy Cloud is seriously comfy, and its one of the only seats that came close to the Toto in this department. Its lowest setting is comfortable for beginners, while its highest is powerful without feeling painful or sharp. Outside of the Toto, I havent found a stream as comfortable as this one.\n\nAnother great feature of the Tushy Cloud is its adjustable oscillation. Many other bidets Ive tested have some sort of oscillation, but the Tushy Cloud (along with the Cloud+ and Aura) is the only bidet Ive tested with multiple levels. The first level of oscillation feels like other bidets Ive used, but the second level covers an even wider area, so youll never have to scoot back and forth to ensure a good clean again.\n\nMolly Flores/CNN Underscored\n\nThe Cloud has a sibling in the Tushy Cloud+, and theyre nearly identical bidets. The biggest difference is that the Cloud+ comes with a remote instead of a sidearm. Like with the Toto bidets, I think saving money and buying the bidet with a sidearm is the better choice. The Clouds side panel has lights for settings like temperature and pressure, which the remote of the Cloud+ doesnt have, so I think the arm is easier and more intuitive to use.\n\nThe Cloud is also equipped with a dryer with three different heat settings. The dryer isnt as powerful as the one on the Toto, so I found I had to sit and wait a bit longer. The Cloud+ has three different power levels for the dryer for a more customizable and effective experience, a feature I wish was also available on the Cloud.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nEven though the Cloud has all the important features, it doesnt have some of the nice extras that the Toto C2 has. It doesnt come with a deodorizer or a bowl mister, but those are just nice extras and shouldnt be super important to your buying decision. However, the Cloud does have a night light, which the Toto does not.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the biggest drawback to the Cloud is that it only comes in an elongated version. I only have a round toilet in my apartment, but I could mount the Cloud with only a little overlap. Even though it worked for me, I wouldnt recommend trying the same since you run the risk of the bidet not fitting at all. If you do have a round toilet, Id point you back to the Toto Washlet C2. However, the round version of that bidet can feel a little small, so if youre a larger person with a round toilet, our old value pick, the Alpha JX2, is probably the best bidet for you.\n\nHow we tested\n\nIve conducted multiple rounds of testing and have formally tested 31 bidets over a period of nearly four years to find the best ones on the market. To do that, I installed each bidet and used it for at least two days, noting the effectiveness and adjustability of all its features.\n\nI broke up the testing into two main categories: performance and design. Within each category, I conducted various tests and examined every aspect of each bidet from ease of installation to number of features, spray quality and so much more.\n\nPerformance\n\nGeneral experience: I noted my overall impressions while using each bidet and what traits stood out the most, whether it was the comfort of the stream, simplicity of controls, ease of setup, etc.\n\nI noted my overall impressions while using each bidet and what traits stood out the most, whether it was the comfort of the stream, simplicity of controls, ease of setup, etc. Water temperature: I judged how comfortable the water temperature felt during each bidets wash cycle at each temperature setting.

Warranty: I researched each bidets warranty and ranked them.\n\nHow to choose the best bidet\n\nBidets have so many features, shapes and technologies that its hard to keep everything straight. So if you need a little guidance, Im breaking down everything you need to know about bidets so you can have a better buying experience.\n\nThe simplest bidets are bidet attachments, which are installed underneath your existing toilet seat. Think of the Tushy Classic 3.0: Youre not replacing your seat, just putting a thin attachment underneath it (Tushy released two attachments, the Wave and Oasis, which actually replace your seat like an electric bidet. These have a sleeker look and are easier to take off and clean). These attachments are the cheaper option, but you sacrifice a lot of comfort. For one, I found the stream in all the attachments I tried to be much harsher than any of the electric bidet seats I tested. Plus, as I mentioned before, bidet seat attachments dont have internal electric heaters, rely on hot water from your sink and, in all the options I tested, didnt get noticeably warm during the time I spent washing.\n\nIf you want predictable, adjustable heating and more control over the stream, youll have to upgrade to an electric bidet seat. Electric bidet seats cost more, but for the investment, you get a big upgrade in experience. The streams are gentler and more effective, the water actually gets warm and you get other technologies like a heated seat and  my favorite feature  the dryer.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nElectric bidet seats with a good dryer are a great purchase because they not only give you a better experience on the toilet, but if you use the dryer after your wash, you also end up using less toilet paper, which is great for the planet and your wallet. I expected to use less toilet paper with all the bidets I tested, but quickly found that bidet attachments leave you needing to pat dry, which often takes just as much toilet paper as youd normally use. For that reason, if cutting back on toilet paper is a big motivation for your bidet purchase, Id recommend getting one with a dryer.\n\nNow, electric bidet seats vary in price due to the wide range of features and technologies available. Typically, tankless units (that use a coil heater to provide unlimited hot water) are more expensive than those that use a reserve tank to store enough hot water for a single use. Most bidets with endless hot water will cost you somewhere around $500, though one of our top picks, the Tushy Cloud and one of our previous picks the Alpha JX2, come in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, making them a great buy.\n\nMounting bracket for an electric bidet seat Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nOnce you know what sort of bidet you want, ensure it fits on your toilet. In general, the first thing youll want to check is if you have a one-piece toilet or a two-piece toilet. A one-piece toilet has no separation between the bowl and the tank behind it, whereas a two-piece toilet has a gap between those two elements. All bidets will fit a two-piece toilet (you will need to check the bowl shape, but more on that in a second), but some one-piece designs dont leave enough room to fit an attachment. So if you have a one-piece toilet youll want to make sure you dont have one with a French curve (where the frame of the toilet between the bowl and the tank curves up), and you should always measure the space between the bowl and the tank to ensure it matches your desired bidets requirements.\n\nIf you want an electric bidet seat, youll have to measure your bowl to see if its elongated or round. Most come in varieties to fit both, so youll want to ensure the bidet you purchase fits correctly. To see which measurements are which, check out this compatibility guide from BidetKing.\n\nKai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored\n\nInstalling bidets, both attachments and full seats, is surprisingly simple. You dont have to be particularly handy and only need a screwdriver and maybe a wrench. Most instruction manuals are quite clear, but its important to note that for all bidets, youll have to remove your existing toilet seat. With most attachments, youll put the seat back on, but with electric bidet seats, youll mount the bidet onto your toilet and remove your old seat and lid. Its good to check out how your current seat mounts beforehand, as some lids have a quick-release function, while others screw off, so be sure you know how yours works, as it could affect your installation.\n\nIf you go into the shopping experience knowing exactly what kind of toilet you have and what kind of bidet you want, its much easier to find the perfect one for you. Plus, installation becomes easier when you know your bidet fits.\n\nOther bidet attachments we tested\n\nTushy Wave Nonelectric Bidet Tushy This attachment replaces your seat entirely, which makes it easier to clean and more aesthetically pleasing. $199 at Tushy\n\nI really liked Tushys Wave bidet. It puts a new twist on bidet attachments by using the same mounting system found on electric seats. Instead of putting a slim attachment underneath your existing seat, the Wave replaces it entirely. That means you get a slimmer look without any uneven toilet seats. Plus, by using a mounting bracket, you can detach the bidet from the seat in seconds for easy cleaning.\n\nWhile its a nice upgrade from the Classic, this bidet is missing the ability to adjust the streams position  a basic feature I was shocked wasnt included  and its quite pricey. Electric bidet seats start around $200, so I dont think its worth spending close to that amount when youre not getting a heated seat, heated water or dryer.\n\nThis bidet is built just like the Tushy Wave, except it can provide a warm water wash  in theory, at least. In testing, Ive found the water takes an extremely long time to heat up since youre just rerouting water from your bathroom sink faucets hot water line. Just think about how long it takes for your sinks water to heat up; thats how long youll have to wait for your bidet. I think this bidet is in an awkward middle ground and would recommend an electric bidet seat, especially at this price tag.\n\nThis bidet attachment had the second-most comfortable stream behind the Tushy but wasnt anywhere near as comfortable. Its got one knob that controls both the front and rear wash, but youre unable to adjust the position beyond that.\n\nThe Omigo Element+ has a dedicated front and rear wash instead of the general adjustability of the Tushy and isnt anywhere near as comfortable to use.\n\nThe stream on the Brondell SimpleSpa Thinline felt thin and more aggressive than the other bidet attachments I tried. It wasnt a comfortable experience and wed recommend the Tushy if youre looking for a low-cost bidet.\n\nIf you really want to spend the least amount of money to just test out a bidet, you could consider the Yasfel. However, it had an incredibly uncomfortable stream that would likely turn bidet newbies away. I think its better to spend more on a bidet youll actually enjoy, like the Tushy Classic 3.0.\n\nOther bidet seats we tested\n\nAlpha Bidet Alpha JX2 Bidet Seat Alpha Bidet This Alpha bidet seat was our previous best value bidet but was dethroned by the Tushy Cloud. If you want a decently comfortable stream and endless warm water for a good price, but have a round toilet, this is the bidet for you. $389 at Amazon\n\nThe Alpha JX2 has been at the top of our list since I first wrote this guide in 2021. It was a special bidet in the market because it offered one of the nicest upgrades  coil-heated water  at the lowest price. It doesnt have the most comfortable spray or dryer, but that could easily be overlooked for its tech.\n\nUnfortunately for this bidet, the Tushy Cloud has endless water in a more comfortable stream for $359, slightly undercutting the Alpha JX2. The JX2 has a few more features like a bowl mist, but we dont think those extras make up for the comfort difference. Its still a solid bidet, though, and since the Cloud only comes in elongated, this is a great pick if you have a round toilet.\n\nToto Washlet C5 Bidet Seat Toto If you want the remote and user presets of the K300 but don't need the endless warm water, the Toto C5 is the bidet for you. $469 $373 at Amazon\n\nThis bidet is a slight upgrade from our runner-up bidet seat, the Toto Washlet C2, adding a remote control and the ability to set two user presets. Its a fantastic bidet with an ultra-comfortable stream and dryer.\n\nIf you want the best of the best, check out the Toto Washlet K300. Its expensive, but it uses coil heating to provide instant hot water for as long as you want, all with Totos famously comfortable stream. It also has extras like user presets for the ultimate bidet experience, but it only comes in an elongated version.\n\nTushy Cloud+ Tushy The Cloud+ is very similar to the Cloud and has instant hot water at a reasonable price. It uses a remote (which I didn't love) and more dryer speeds than the Cloud. $399 at Tushy\n\nThe Cloud+ was a close contender for our best value bidet spot, but it lost out to the Cloud for a couple of small reasons. Its $40 more but comes with a remote instead of a built-in arm. However, I like the arm better unless you have a super cramped bathroom. The remote is oriented horizontally, so it isnt as easy to use with one hand as some other remotes I tried, and the arm of the Cloud has lights so you can see which setting youre on, which the remote of the Cloud+ does not.\n\nBut, if the controls dont bother you, the Cloud+ has a bonus of three dryer speeds, which improves upon one of the Clouds only weak spots. This bidet is still a great buy and you should consider it  if you have an elongated toilet  but it couldnt beat out its cheaper sibling for our top spot.\n\nTushy Aura Bidet Seat Tushy This pricey bidet has an auto-open lid, but its cramped remote and price knocked it out of contention. $599 at Tushy\n\nThe Tushy Aura could be a fantastic bidet for some, but unfortunately, it was quite annoying when installed in my small bathroom. The flashiest feature of the Aura is its auto-open lid, which could be useful in a larger bathroom, but whenever Id walk into mine the sensor would detect movement and it would open. Even when I went in to brush my teeth and I wasnt in front of the bidet, itd open. This was annoying in my case, but your experience might be better, depending on the layout of your bathroom.\n\nBesides the sensitive lid, I also didnt like its remote. Tons of random buttons filled the top, bottom and one side of the remote, making it feel too cramped. Whenever I picked up the remote, Id accidentally hit a button on the back or side. Even without those problems, Im unsure Id recommend this bidet over the Cloud+, which is $200 cheaper.\n\nNova Bidet Eco Nova Bidet Seat Nova Bidet This bidet only comes in elongated versions and wasn't as comfortable to use as other bidets we tested, especially when it came to its dryer. From $699 at Many Bidets\n\nThe Eco Nova Bidet Seat has instant, unlimited water but couldnt stack up to the Tushy Cloud in overall comfort. Its stream wasnt too bad, but its dryer felt uncomfortably hot. It also had a slightly different installation process, so even if youre familiar with bidets you should read the instructions. Our last, small issue with this bidet is that its lid would always fall by itself on our toilet, which didnt happen with any other bidets we tested.\n\nToto Washlet A2 Elongated Bidet Seat Toto If all you want is a comfortable stream, this Toto bidet is an okay pick, but I think the warm air dryer of the C2 is worth the extra money. $272 at Amazon\n\nThe most budget-friendly of Totos Washlet Bidet Series, the A2 includes many of the great features as the C2  warm water, dual action spray with oscillator, adjustable water temp and volume settings, heated seat with temperature control and that convenient arm control panel we love. Its high on comfort and ease of use, but for less than $100 more, the C2 provides warm air drying with three temperature settings, automatic deodorizer, technology that auto-cleans the wand and it also comes in round-front bowl styles.\n\nPrime Day Deal Bio Bidet BB-550 Bidet Seat Bio Bidet If you don't want to commit to spending as much for a bidet seat, this is another solid option, but it isn't as feature-filled as the C2. $281 at Amazon\n\nIf youre ready to test the bidet seat, er, waters, I highly recommend this slim-profile model. Easy to install once we traded out the toilet supply line hose for a longer, more flexible $10 piece from the hardware store, we like that it comes loaded with features including warm water, an adjustable heated seat, a seat sensor to keep any accidental sprays from happening, a warm air dryer, adjustable water pressure and even a night light.\n\nI also appreciate that it boasts a self-cleaning feature that rinses the nozzles before each use and that it offers a variety of wash options: front, rear, turbo, pulse and standard. But the controls are located on the sides of the seat, which makes them much less intuitive to use than the Toto Washlet C2 and the Totos stream and dryer also prove to be more comfortable. Still, for $220, its a great choice.\n\nThis bidet is a solid option with a comfortable and effective stream. Its spray wasnt quite as good as Totos, and its dryer didnt cover the wide area that Totos did, but it was comfortable, and in general, I enjoyed using this bidet.\n\nThe LE99 Swash from Brondell is very similar to the LE89, but instead of a sidearm control panel, you can adjust all its settings with a remote control. Just like the LE89, its a solid bidet, but it could use some improvements on its dryer.\n\nBrondell Swash DS275 Brondell The stream and dryer of this bidet just weren't as comfortable as the Toto or the Alpha JX2. $399 $340 at Brondell\n\nThe spray on the Brondell Swash DS275 wasnt as good as that on the Toto Washlets. And similar to the other Brondell bidets, I didnt think the dryer was as effective as the Totos. It does come with a massage function and a deodorizer, but I think the oscillation of the Toto C2 and Alpha JX2 do the job better, and if you want a deodorizer, go with a Toto.\n\nThe new version of the Alpha Bidet iX Hybrid  which I also tried in our first round of testing  has tankless heating, but its dryer was uncomfortable. After using the dryer for about 20 seconds, the back of the seat began to get hot, so much so that leaning back on it wasnt an option.\n\nThis bidets stream and dryer felt decent, but its remote was much worse than that of our winners. Its circular design wasnt comfortable to hold, and it required two hands to use it easily. Plus, I had some pairing issues with the remote and the bidet that were quite frustrating.\n\nThe Bidetmega 150s spray wasnt nearly as comfortable as the Totos or the Alpha JX2s, and the dryer wasnt as effective as either of our picks. Plus, installing the Coway bidets was the hardest of all the options I tested. The T-valve you use to connect your bidet to your bathrooms water line is divided into parts, meaning you have to find the properly sized adapters to attach the bidet. It adds an extra, confusing step and also gives the connection more points where it could leak.\n\nIf you want a luxury bidet but cant find the Toto K300, wed pick the Bio Bidet BB-2000 Bliss. It didnt perform quite as well as the Toto K300, but it has a very comfortable spray and dryer, and its massage function was my favorite stream pattern out of all the bidets I tested. The remote is more complicated than the Totos, so it takes a while to learn what all the symbols mean and what they do.\n\nThe Tushy Ace was another solid luxury contender, but its stream and dryer comfort just couldnt cut it against the Toto K300. It also doesnt have the extra features the K300 does like user presets, pre-mist or a deodorizer. But, if youre a Tushy loyalist, you wont be let down.\n\nThe Coway Bidetmega 400 had a similarly frustrating installation process as the cheaper Coway bidets. The Bidetmega 400 has more features than the 150 and 200; however, its spray wasnt as comfortable or effective as other top contenders, even though it automatically goes through a four-stage washing cycle unique to Coway bidets. Its a nice luxury bidet, but if youre willing to spend slightly more, I think youll be better served by a Toto or the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000.\n\nThe Brondell Swash 1400 and Omigo Luxury Bidet seemed to be the exact same bidet seat with different branding. The Swash 1400 didnt have the most comfortable stream, and its dryer felt like it was only hitting half of the area it needed to. If youre spending this much money on a bidet, I recommend the Toto K300 or the Bio Bidet Bliss BB-2000.\n\nThe Omigo Luxury Bidet felt and looked identical to the Brondell Swash 1400 and had similar problems, with a lackluster spray and ineffective dryer.\n\nEditors Note: We previously tested the Alpha Bidet iX Hybrid Bidet Toilet Seat, the Alpha Bidet JX and the Coway Bidetmega 200 Electric Bidet Seat, but they have since been discontinued and removed from this article.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do you install a bidet? First, find and close your toilets water valve and flush the toilet to empty the tank. Take off your existing toilet seat and clean the bowl. If you have a bidet attachment, simply put it on the bowl, then reattach your toilet seat on top of it. If you have a full bidet seat, youll have to screw in a mounting bracket and slide the seat on. The bidet will come with a T-valve and some hoses that youll need to connect to your existing water connection (making sure everything is screwed down correctly is the most important step to prevent leaks. Use plumbers tape if you need to). Once all the hoses are connected, slowly turn the water back on, wait 10 to 15 minutes and check for leaks. If there are no leaks, you can plug in your electric bidet seat and start using it. How much is a bidet? Bidet attachments can range from about $30 to over $100. You wont pay too much more for an attachment because theyre quite simple. Electric bidet seats, however, have a wide range of pricing that depends on features, but the typical range for most bidets is between $250 and $700. How to clean a bidet? Most bidets nowadays will have a nozzle that cleans itself, but its still a good idea to occasionally give the whole bidet a solid clean. Check your manual, but you should take your bidet off the toilet, empty its tank of water if it has one, and use a bathroom cleaner to remove any mildew or buildup on the bidet.\n\nWhy trust CNN Underscored\n\nCNN Underscored editors thoroughly test all the products we cover and provide full transparency about how we test them.

        "content": "The day after immigration raids began in Los Angeles, Rep. Norma Torres (D-Pomona) and three other members of Congress were denied entry to the immigrant detention facility inside the Roybal Federal Building.\n\nThe lawmakers were attempting an unannounced inspection, a common and long-standing practice under congressional oversight powers.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials said too many protesters were present on June 7 and officers deployed chemical agents multiple times. In a letter later to acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, Torres said she ended up in the emergency room for respiratory treatment. She also said the protest had been small and peaceful.\n\nTorres is one of many Democratic members of Congress, from states including California, New York and Illinois, who have been denied entry to immigrant detention facilities in recent weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Townsend, director of the Carl Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy at Wayne State University in Michigan, said the denials mark a profound  and illegal  shift from past practice.\n\nDenying members of Congress access to facilities is a direct assault on our system of checks and balances, he said. What members of Congress are trying to do now is to be part of a proud bipartisan tradition of what we like to call oversight by showing up.\n\nSubsequent attempts by lawmakers to inspect the facility inside the Roybal Building have also been unsuccessful.\n\nRep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), who was with Torres the day she was hospitalized, went back twice more  on June 9 and on Tuesday  and was rebuffed. Torres and Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) tried at separate times Wednesday and were both denied.\n\nGomez and other Democrats have pointed to a federal statute, detailed in yearly appropriations packages since 2020, which states that funds may not be used to prevent a member of Congress from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens ...\n\nThe statute also states that nothing in that section may be construed to require a Member of Congress to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility for the purpose of conducting oversight. Under the statute, federal officials may require at least 24 hours notice for a visit by congressional staff  but not members themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder ICE guidelines published this month for members of Congress and their staff, the agency requests at least 72 hours notice from lawmakers and requires at least 24 hours notice from staff.\n\nThe agency says it has discretion to deny or reschedule a visit if an emergency arises or the safety of the facility is jeopardized, though such contingencies are not mentioned in the law.\n\nGomez said an ICE official called him Tuesday to say that oversight law doesnt apply to the downtown L.A. facility because it is a field office, not a detention facility.\n\nWell it does say Metropolitan Detention Center right here in big, bold letters, he says in a video posted afterward on social media, gesturing toward a sign outside the building. But they say this is a processing center. So I smell bull.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security police patrol the street after detaining a protester at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in downtown L.A. on June 12. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIf no one is technically being detained, Gomez said he rhetorically asked the official during their call, are they free to leave?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTorres visited the facility in February by setting up an appointment, her staff said. She got another appointment for last Saturday, but ICE canceled it because of the protests. When members emailed ICE to set up a new appointment, they got no response.\n\nGomez said he believes ICE doesnt want lawmakers to see field offices because of poor conditions and lack of attorney access because of ramped-up arrests that have reportedly left some detainees there overnight without beds and limited food.\n\nIn some cases, lawmakers have had success showing up unannounced. On Friday, Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Redlands) toured the Adelanto ICE Processing Facility, north of San Bernardino. After being denied entry to the Adelanto Facility on June 8, Chu and four other California Democrats were allowed in on Tuesday.\n\nJust because ICE has opened their doors to a few members of Congress does not excuse their inflammatory tactics to meet deportation quotas, said Rep. Mark Takano (D-Riverside), who visited Adelanto with Chu. Accountability means showing a consistent pattern of accessibility, not just a one-off event.\n\nThe representatives learned the facility is now at full capacity with 1,100 detainees, up from 300 a month ago. Chu said they spoke to detainees from the L.A. raids, who she said were not criminals and who are now living in inhumane conditions  without enough food, unable to change their underwear for 10 days or to call their families and lawyers.\n\nChu said the group arrived early and stood in the lobby to avoid a repeat of their previous attempt, when facility guards kept them off the property by locking a fence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Homan, President Trumps border policy advisor, departs a meeting with Republican senators who are working to cancel $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress at the Capitol in Washington on June 11. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press)\n\nIn an interview with The Times this month, Trumps chief border policy advisor Tom Homan said members of Congress are welcome to conduct oversight, but that they must contact the facility first to make arrangements. The agency has to look after the safety and security of the facility, officers and detainees, he said.\n\nPlease go in and look at them, he said. Theyre the best facilities that money can buy, the highest detention standards in the industry. But theres a right way and wrong way to do it.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Homeland Security, said in a statement to The Times that requests for visits are needed because ICE law enforcement have seen a surge in assaults, disruptions and obstructions to enforcement, including by politicians themselves.\n\nShe added that requests for visits should be made with enough time  a week is sufficient  to not interfere with the presidents authority under Article II of the Constitution to oversee executive branch functions.\n\nDHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin, flanked by Deputy Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Madison Sheahan, left, and acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons, speaks during a news conference in Washington on May 21. (Jose Luis Magana / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, slammed the guidance Wednesday on X.\n\nThis unlawful policy is a smokescreen to deny Member visits to ICE offices across the country, which are holding migrants  and sometimes even U.S. citizens  for days at a time, he wrote. They are therefore facilities and are subject to oversight and inspection at any time. DHS pretending otherwise is simply their latest lie.\n\nTownsend, the congressional oversight expert, said the practice goes back to when President Truman was a senator and established a committee to investigate problems among contractors who were supplying the World War II effort.\n\nThat committee conducted hundreds of field visits, and they would show up unannounced in many instances, Townsend said.\n\nMore recently, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) drove to the Pentagon in 1983 and demanded access to ask questions about overspending after being stonewalled, he said, by Department of Defense officials.\n\nThe Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to mean that Congress has wide authority to conduct oversight to show up unannounced in order to secure accurate information, Townsend said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNational Guard members stand at post at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in Los Angeles on June 10. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said the Trump administration is trying to hide the truth from the public. Last week, Padilla was shoved out of a news conference, forced to the ground and handcuffed after attempting to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this article said Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) addressed the Senate on Wednesday. He spoke Tuesday.\n\nThe Trump administration has done everything in their power but to provide transparency to the American people about their mission in Los Angeles, he said during an impassioned floor speech Tuesday in which he cried recounting the ordeal.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with Newsmax, McLaughlin accused Democratic lawmakers of using oversight as an excuse to stage publicity stunts.\n\nThe Democrats are reeling, she said. They have no actual message and so theyre doing this to get more attention and to manufacture viral moments.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gomez wore a suit jacket with his congressional lapel pin and carried his congressional ID card and business card in his hand  so there would be no mistake as to who he was. He said he was concerned that what happened to Padilla could also happen to him. He was denied access anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGomez said federal officials should be fined each time they deny oversight access to members of Congress. He said he and other members are also discussing whether to file a lawsuit to compel access.\n\nWhen you have an administration that is operating outside the bounds of the law, theyre basically saying, What recourse do you have? Can you force us? You dont have an army. We dont need to listen to you, Gomez said. Then you have to put some real teeth into it.\n\nTimes staff writer Nathan Solis in Los Angeles contributed to this report."

        "content": "Hundreds of people join clergy members in a peaceful interfaith march through downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, calling for an end to federal immigration raids.\n\nMore than a dozen religious leaders from an array of faiths marched to the steps of the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday night, flowers in hand, calling for an end to the federal immigration raids they say have torn families apart and resulted in racial profiling.\n\nAt the start of the procession in Plaza Olvera, the Rev. Tanya Lopez, senior pastor at Downey Memorial Christian Church, recounted how last week she watched as plainclothes federal agents swarmed a constituent in the parking lot of her church. Despite her attempts to intervene, she said, the man was detained, and she doesnt know where he is now.\n\nAll of our faith traditions teach us to love our neighbor, to leave the world with less suffering than when we find it, and this is creating trauma that will be unable to be undone for generations, Lopez said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReligious leaders from multiple faiths left flowers on the steps of the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles in honor of people detained in recent immigration raids. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nFederal enforcement actions have played out across Southern California this week as the Trump administration carries out its vows to do mass deportations of immigrants in the country without documentation. Initially, President Trump focused his rhetoric on those who had committed violent crimes. But shortly after he took office, his administration made clear that it considers anyone in the country without authorization to be a criminal.\n\nThe raids  which have spanned bus stops, Home Depot parking lots, swap meets, farms and factories  have prompted many immigrants to go into hiding, and in some cases, to self-deport.\n\nThe religious leaders marching Wednesday called for a halt to the raids, saying immigrants are integral to the Los Angeles community and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of documentation status. The walk was organized by L.A. Voice and PICO California, which stands for People Improving Communities through Organizing, the largest faith-based community organizing network in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey carried their message through downtown, marching from Plaza Olvera to the Federal Building, dressed in colorful garb reflecting Jewish, Sikh, Muslim and Catholic traditions, and uniting in song and prayer, in Spanish and English.\n\nThey called out to God, Creator, the Holy One, and prayed for healing and justice. They prayed for the hundreds of people who have been detained or deported and the families theyve left behind.\n\nFather Brendan Busse of Dolores Mission Church looks out over the crowd participating in an interfaith protest Wednesday in downtown Los Angeles. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the crowd, Talia Guppy held purple flowers to her chest as she sang along. Guppy said she learned that members of her Episcopalian church, St. Stephens Hollywood, had been detained during the raid of the Ambiance Apparel factory in downtown L.A. Her church has since moved its services online to accommodate people afraid to venture from their homes.\n\nWere out here for them, she said. Were going to keep the hope and keep the faith until we get justice for them.\n\nAt the end of the procession, the marchers approached the steps of the Federal Building. Officers from the Department of Homeland Security poured out of the building and guarded the entrance as clergy leaders lined the steps. Inside, behind semireflective doors, rows of U.S. Marines stood at the ready.\n\nThe leaders called for peace and laid flowers on the steps in tribute to those who have been detained.\n\nWe come with flowers, and we will keep coming with flowers as long as our loved ones are held in cages, said Valarie Kaur, a Sikh leader. She turned her attention to the officers at the doors, who stood stoic, and questioned how they wanted to be remembered by history. Then she placed flowers by their feet.\n\nSikh leader Valarie Kaur leaves a flower at the feet of federal officers standing guard at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles.

The clergy asked them to be ready to defend their neighbors in the coming days.\n\nFather Brendan Busse, a Jesuit priest at the Dolores Mission Church in Boyle Heights, said he has felt the impact of the raids within his church. Devoted members are no longer in the pews. Others call asking whether it is safe to come to church. The fear is palpable.\n\nWe need to be a safe space for people, not just in our church, but in the whole neighborhood, he said. I cant guarantee to anybody that we are a totally safe space, but to at least give them a sense that in the difficult moment were at, that we stand together."

        "content": "CNN \n\nThe 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said.\n\nAndrew Lester, who faces two felony charges  assault in the first degree and armed criminal action  in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. CNN has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information.\n\nLester turned himself in at a detention center Tuesday then hours later was released on bail. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriffs Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd.\n\nRalph, 16, was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. He has been released from a hospital but faces an arduous road to recovery, his family said.\n\nLester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door.\n\nThis booking photo of Andrew Lester was taken after he turned himself in to authorities Tuesday. Clay County, Missouri, Sheriff's Office\n\nCNN has not been able to reach the homeowner. CNN has yet to determine whether Lester has an attorney.\n\nThe criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralphs family  but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralphs recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN.\n\nIts not as simple as turning a page, Spoonmore said Tuesday. Its a little better that he is  hopefully  going to get part of what of he deserves.\n\nBut questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting.\n\nI share the outrage and concern of many in asking why, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN.\n\nIn Missouri, you can have a 24-hour hold. It is clear here that this was two or three hours, where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening.\n\nLester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN.\n\nLester thought Ralph was trying to break in to the home and was scared to death due to the boys size, according to the document.\n\nRalph Yarl From Instagram\n\nOfficers responded just before 10 p.m. that night after receiving reports of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Ralph wounded in the street.\n\nThe shooting left Ralph, who plays bass clarinet and is a band leader in school, with gunshot wounds to his head and arm. While he was hospitalized, Ralph told police he did not pull on the door, according to the document.\n\nIt was nothing short of a miracle that Ralph was discharged from the hospital, his attorney Ben Crump told CNN on Monday. But hes not out of the woods yet.\n\nThe shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery  young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense.\n\nDemonstrators have marched through Kansas City chanting, Justice for Ralph, and calling for the shooters arrest.\n\nThe shooting also came days before a 20-year-old woman was shot and killed in upstate New York after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway.\n\nWhile Ralphs attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter, it remains unclear whether Missouris stand your ground law will be cited in Lesters defense case.\n\nStand your ground laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\n\nRalphs aunt challenged the notion that her nephews size could be a threat.\n\nI really dont understand how, Spoonmore said. I doubt Ralph is even 170 pounds. Ralph is not even 6 feet (tall).\n\nShe said shes on a mission to help get justice for her nephew.\n\nI want justice to look the same across the board, Spoonmore said. I want justice to look the same.\n\nA racial component to this case\n\nThe mayor said he believes Ralph was racially profiled by the shooter.\n\nThis boy was shot because he was existing while Black, Lucas said.\n\nClay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson has said, There was a racial component to this case, but did not elaborate.\n\nOn the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN.\n\nLester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done, Thompson said.\n\nAttorney Crump questioned why Lester was not detained longer.\n\nNobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head, Crump told CNN.\n\nHe merely rang the doorbell. That was it, the teens attorney said. And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.\n\nThe mayor said he didnt even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. And while he believes race played a role in the shooting, he acknowledged the work by police  including White officers  who helped prosecutors file charges against Lester.\n\nWe did have officers, White officers for what its worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter, Lucas said.\n\nThat being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nBefore the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement.\n\nHe then went to his homes front entrance, which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door  both of which were locked.\n\nA police vehicle is seen Monday outside the house where 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot. Charlie Riedel/AP\n\nLester opened the interior door and saw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle, Lester told police.\n\nHe stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door, the probable cause statement reads.\n\nHe believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in, the document reads.\n\nLester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting, according to the document.\n\nProtesters march Sunday in Kansas City. Susan Pfannmuller/AP\n\nPolice spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says.\n\nWhile the teenager was still on the ground, the man then fired again, shooting him in the arm, Ralph told police.\n\nRalph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot, and he heard the man say, Dont come around here, the document says. He then went to multiple nearby homes asking for help and telling people to call police.\n\nThe boy told police he did not pull on the door, according to the probable cause document.\n\nResponding officers also found the front storm door glass at Lesters home broken, with blood on the front porch and the driveway, according to the document.\n\nThe teen had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up, a GoFundMe page started by Ralphs aunt states.\n\nA neighbor, who asked not to be identified, told CNN she called 911 after Ralph came to her door, bleeding.\n\nSince the shooters location was unknown at the time, she was directed to stay inside her home by the emergency operator for her safety. She said she complied initially, then went outside with towels to help suppress the bleeding.\n\nThis is somebodys child. I had to clean blood off of my door, off of my railing. That was someones childs blood, she said. Im a mom  this is not OK.\n\nYou cant profile and shoot our children\n\nRalph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said.\n\nHe and his family are just happy that hes alive after being shot in the head, Crump told CNN.\n\nMerritt said Tuesday the first bullet traveled less than five feet into Yarls upper temple and penetrated his skull.\n\nThey scraped bullet fragments off his frontal lobe on Thursday. On Saturday he was home playing with his dog, Merritt said.\n\nHe said God was telling the community and its leaders they cannot go on as business usual.\n\nThat was in fact a miracle. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.\n\nRalph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page.\n\nLife looks a lot different right now. Even though he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally. The trauma that he has to endure and survive is unimaginable, the aunt wrote in the fundraiser.\n\nThe GoFundMe page, started to help the family with medical expenses, had garnered more than $2 million in donations by Monday night.\n\nCrump likened Ralphs shooting to the shootings of 17-year-old Martin in Florida and 25-year-old Arbery in Georgia.\n\nWe continue to fight to say you cant profile and shoot our children, just because you have this stand your ground law, Crump said. Unacceptable.\n\nMerritt told CNN Monday that the stand your ground action would not apply to Ralphs case.\n\nThe stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter, Merritt said.\n\nPresident chats with teen and mother\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke with Ralph and his mother, Cleo Nagbe, by phone on Monday evening, a White House official told CNN.\n\nBiden also noted how fortunate Ralph is that his mother is not just a nurse, but also a physical therapist.\n\nThe conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralphs dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University  to which Biden lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the presidents alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option, the official said.\n\nThe president also committed to keeping up his fight against gun violence, the official said."

        "content": "Since Donald Trumps return to the White House, his administration has overhauled core institutions and norms. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss the first 100 days of the presidents second termand what may come next for the country.\n\nOn the subject of Trumps impact as president since his inauguration, The Atlantics editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, posed a question to the panelists: What is the most consequential action hes taken, or whats the biggest change weve seen in American governance?\n\nThe difference between Trump now and Trump previously is one thing Ive been struck by, which is just how confident, bold, aggressive, creative he has been at sort of wielding the levers of powers at his disposal to bend, you know, the city, the country, and the world to his will, Atlantic staff writer Ashley Parker said last night.\n\nTrump traditionally is someone who is trying to get through the minute, the hour, the day, Parker continued. He is trying to win over the person directly in front of him. But the president also now appears to be tolerating more criticism than he might have in his first term: On tariffs, Parker explained, he had the stomach, at least initially, for more pain as the markets plummeted and as he was getting, you know, lobbied behind the scenes, and some pretty public criticism. Trump, she added, stood by that much longer than I would have expected for someone who is traditionally pinballing between whatever is politically expedient in that moment.\n\nJoining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Kaitlan Collins, the chief White House correspondent at CNN; Stephen Hayes, the editor of The Dispatch; Asma Khalid, a White House correspondent for NPR; and Ashley Parker, a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\nWatch the full episode here."

        "content": "Haiti's iconic Hotel Oloffson, long a cultural beacon, destroyed by gang violence\n\ntoggle caption Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times/Getty\n\nPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti One of Haiti's most storied landmarks  a 19th-century gingerbread mansion that once hosted cultural luminaries and political intrigue  has been reduced to ashes in the latest wave of gang violence gripping the capital.\n\nThe Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, long a haven for artists, writers, musicians and foreign dignitaries, had weathered dictatorships, coups, and natural disasters. But this weekend, it could not survive Haiti's spiraling security crisis.\n\n\"It's where I spent my last 40 years. It's where I met my wife. It's where my kids grew up. It's where we played, where we had parties, where we danced,\" said Richard Morse, the Haitian-American long term tenant and manager of the hotel, speaking by phone from his home in Maine.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMorse didn't just manage the property  he fronted the Haitian roots band RAM, which played legendary Thursday night sets from the hotel's wraparound balcony. The Oloffson was more than a business. \"It was a heartbeat,\" he said.\n\ntoggle caption Slim Aarons/Hulton archive/Getty Images\n\nThe hotel's history is as rich as its architecture. Built in the late 1800s, it once served as a presidential residence and later as a U.S. Marine Corps hospital. As a hotel, it became a gathering place for cultural royalty  from Mick Jagger and Jackie Kennedy Onassis to Haitian painters and poets.\n\nThe Oloffson also lives on in literature. British novelist Graham Greene, who stayed there in the 1960s, immortalized it in The Comedians, a dark satire set during the brutal regime of Franois \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier and his feared Tontons Macoute. The novel was later adapted into a film starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor  herself a guest at the hotel.\n\nIn recent months, the Oloffson stood on the frontlines of a turf war. The Viv Ansanm gang coalition, which has taken over much of Port-au-Prince, had been targeting once-gentrified neighborhoods like the one surrounding the hotel. Morse said he hadn't been able to access the building since April.\n\n\"I've been trying to get there for months,\" he said. \"And no one would let me go.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe fire that destroyed the hotel broke out amid clashes between gangs and Haitian police in the Carrefour-Feuilles neighborhood. It was one of several historic buildings torched in recent days.\n\ntoggle caption DANIEL MOREL/AP\n\nMorse admits he's uneasy about the attention the hotel's destruction has drawn, considering the broader suffering across the country.\n\n\"The most difficult part for me is attracting all this attention to a hotel,\" he said, \"when there are so many people out there being killed and raped. The way I can justify it is, if the hotel is bringing attention to the killings and injustices, then maybe it serves a purpose.\"\n\nNearly 90% of Port-au-Prince is under gang control. Hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been displaced by the violence. Still, Morse insists neither the spirit of the Oloffson  nor Haiti itself  is lost.\n\n\"I don't think we're going to see places the way we saw them,\" he said. \"But I believe the spirit is not gone. Haitians are such a powerful entity, people can't get rid of it  as much as they try.\""

She is also asking for a preliminary injunction that would prevent her familys immediate deportation to Honduras, as her children cry and pray nightly to be released from a Texas holding facility, according to court documents.\n\nShe and her two children, including a 9-year-old daughter, are facing two removal proceedings concurrently: a previous removal proceeding involving their asylum request and this recent expedited removal process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe woman claims the government violated many of their rights, including the due process clause of the 5th Amendment.\n\nHer attorneys noted that DHS determined she was not a flight risk when she was paroled and that her detention was unjustified.\n\nThe womans lawyers also argued that she was not given an opportunity to contest her familys detention in front of a neutral adjudicator, and that the familys 4th Amendment right to not be unlawfully arrested was violated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Honduran mother is being represented by several groups, including attorney Kate Gibson Kumar of the Texas Civil Rights Project.\n\nSo often, youll hear all the rhetoric in this country that immigrants should be doing it the right way, and its ironic in this case because were in a situation where this family did it the right way and theyre being punished for it, Kumar told The Times on Friday morning. They followed the process, went where they were supposed to go and did everything that was asked of them.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in San Antonio on Tuesday. Kumar said a Texas judge issued an order late Thursday evening that compelled the government to respond to the habeas corpus petition by July 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, countered in an email to The Times on Friday morning that the legal process was playing out fairly.\n\nThis family had chosen to appeal their case  which had already been thrown out by an immigration judge  and will remain in ICE custody until it is resolved.\n\nOne of the focal points of the lawsuit is the fate of the womans son.\n\nThe youth was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 3 and has undergone chemotherapy treatments, including injecting chemotherapeutic agents into his cerebrospinal fluid, according to court documents.\n\nHe began treatment in Honduras and completed two years of chemotherapy, at which point the mother believes he no longer has leukemia cells in his blood, according to court documents.\n\nThe son, however, needs regular monitoring and medical care for his condition, according to court documents.\n\nLast year, the family fled to the United States to seek safety after they were subject to imminent, menacing death threats in Honduras, according to court documents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey applied for entrance while waiting in Mexico and received a CBP One app appointment in October to apply for asylum. They presented themselves at an undisclosed border entry, were processed and were paroled in the U.S., according to court documents.\n\nThey were scheduled to appear before a Los Angeles immigration court and moved to the area to live with family.\n\nBoth children enrolled in local public schools, attended Sunday church and were learning English, according to court documents.\n\nTheyre asylum seekers fleeing from violence, who had an appointment at the border, were paroled into the country and the government made an assessment that they didnt have to be detained, Kumar said. There should be some sort of protection for this family, which is doing everything right.\n\nThe trio arrived at court May 29 for a hearing for their asylum request and were caught off guard when a Homeland Security lawyer asked for their case to be dismissed, according to court documents.\n\nCalifornia ICE arrests at L.A. courthouse met with alarm: Absolutely blindsided U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents intercepted defendants at a Los Angeles courthouse on Tuesday afternoon, sparking fears that such actions will deter people from serving as witnesses or answering subpoenas.\n\nThe woman told an immigration judge we wish to continue [with our cases], according to court documents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge granted the dismissal and the Honduran mother and two children were immediately arrested by plainclothes ICE agents upon leaving the courtroom in the hallway, according to court documents. The woman had a June 5 medical appointment scheduled for her sons cancer diagnosis, which he couldnt attend because of the arrest.\n\nThe family was detained for hours on the first floor before being taken to an undisclosed immigration center in the city, according to court documents.\n\nAll three cried in fear and the young boy urinated on himself and remained in wet clothing for hours, according to court documents.\n\nThe trio were placed on a flight to San Antonio along with several other families. The date of the flight was not available.\n\nAfter landing, the family was transported to a detention center in Dilley, Texas, where they remain.\n\nFortunately, the minor child in question has not undergone chemotherapy in over a year, and has been seen regularly by medical personnel since arriving at the Dilley facility, McLaughlin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcLaughlin added that no family member had been denied emergency care.\n\nThe implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement, she said. ICE ALWAYS prioritizes the health, safety, and well-being of all detainees in its care.\n\nThe children have cried each night and prayed for God to take them out of the detention center, according to court documents.\n\nThe mother claims that the federal government did nothing to monitor her sons leukemia for days.\n\nHer lawyers have also sought the boys release for medical treatment, a request that was not fulfilled."

        "content": "A house lies in the sea off a village near the Onagawa nuclear power plant on March 20, 2011, nine days after the deadly earthquake and tsunami that hit the northeastern coast of Japans main island of Honshu.\n\nMore than 1,300 earthquakes have hit Japans Tokara Islands in two weeks, prompting evacuations of dozens of residents from the remote archipelago on the countrys southern tip.\n\nAlthough no major damage has been reported and no tsunami warnings have been issued, the Japan Meteorological Agency has cautioned that tremors as strong as a lower 6 on Japans seven-stage seismic intensity scale  such as one that occurred Thursday  may continue.\n\nLower 6 indicates an intensity that may make it difficult for people to stand without holding on to stable support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople walk past collapsed buildings after a quake in Wajima, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, on Jan. 2, 2024. (Associated Press)\n\nThe seismic activity remains dynamic, JMA official Ayataka Ebita said at a news conference Sunday  and that has fueled fears of a megaquake.\n\nThe temblors have coincided with viral panic stemming from the 2021 reprint of a comic book that many are now interpreting as a clairvoyant prediction of a major earthquake. The real disaster will come in July 2025, read the cover of manga artist Ryo Tatsukis The Future that I Saw. The graphic novel, which explores Tatsukis dreams, also features a panel that says the ocean floor between Japan and the Philippines will crack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent months, that prediction has become the subject of intense online speculation. It has even spread to nearby countries like Hong Kong, where it has been blamed for a recent dip in tourism to Japan.\n\nLast month, Hong Kong Airlines suspended all flights to the southern Japanese prefectures of Kagoshima and Kumamoto, citing low demand.\n\nIn South Korea, earthquake panic has been cited as a reason for the cheapness of flights to Japan compared with last year, although industry experts have said that there are other factors at play: increased competition between airlines and a stronger yen that reduces the buying power of South Korean tourists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, South Korean singer Taemin of the band SHINee, who was in Japan for a concert, referenced Tatsukis prediction in a livestream, assuring fans he was safe and jokingly saying an earthquake might make his performance look cool.\n\nBut faced with backlash for making light of a natural disaster, he later issued an apology in Japanese and Korean.\n\nThere is a reason why a comic books scientifically baseless prediction is currently gaining so much traction: Tatsuki was (sort of) right before. The first edition of the graphic novel, published in 1999, referenced a massive disaster in March 2011 and contained lines like: I dreamed of a great disaster. The waters of the Pacific Ocean south of the Japanese archipelago will rise.\n\nA California Highway Patrol officer checks the damage to cars that fell when the upper deck of the Bay Bridge collapsed onto the lower deck after the Loma Prieta earthquake in San Francisco on Oct. 17, 1989. (George Nikitin / Associated Press)\n\nThat prediction seemed to come true with the massive 2011 Tohoku earthquake , which killed over 19,000 people and triggered the tsunami that led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. At an estimated $360 billion incurred in economic damages, the earthquake remains one of the costliest natural disasters in history. It registered 9.0 on the Richter scale, which measures the magnitude of the earthquake. Shindo, Japans seismic intensity scale, measures intensity at a specific location.\n\nThe coincidence catapulted Tatsuki to fame and made her manga a bestseller.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Tatsuki has tried to quell the panic over her latest prediction, saying in a statement issued through her publisher that she was not a prophet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe that everyone should be free to make their own interpretation, she told Japans Mainichi newspaper in May. However, I think it is important to not get overly swept up in the process and to act appropriately in consideration of expert opinion.\n\nJapanese government officials and scientists have taken pains to debunk the theories, stressing that it is scientifically impossible to predict earthquakes with such accuracy.\n\nIt is absolutely a coincidence. There is no causal connection, said Ebita of the JMA on Saturday. In Japan, earthquakes can happen at any time. Please be prepared, always.\n\n:::\n\nJapan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, given its location within the Pacific Ring of Fire, a 25,000-mile-long belt of seismic and volcanic hot spots that loops around the perimeter of the Pacific Ocean, including the U.S. West Coast.\n\nThe country experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year, or nearly a fifth of the worlds total, and earthquake evacuation drills are regularly practiced by government agencies and public schools.\n\nOn New Years Day last year, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Noto Peninsula in central Japan led to over 500 deaths and destroyed or damaged at least 37,000 homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause they sit astride two overlapping tectonic plates, the Tokara Islands have long been prone to seismic activity such as earthquake swarms, a burst of relatively minor earthquakes occurring in quick succession that can last up to several months. (Southern California is another common site of earthquake swarms, though many are so minor they are barely perceived.)\n\nThe archipelago spans 12 individual islands  just seven of which are inhabited by a combined 660 or so residents  and the current swarm of quakes there is the most substantial since 1995. Two recent swarms that occurred in 2021 and 2023 exceeded just over 300 quakes each.\n\nAlthough its unclear why the current swarm is so much greater than those instances, Takuya Nishimura, an earthquake expert at Kyoto Universitys Disaster Prevention Research Institute, says it may be a result of volcanic activity.\n\nI suspect the subsurface movement of magma caused severe earthquake activity, he said. Several past studies show submarine volcanoes around the swarm region, which suggests the existence of magma under the ground.\n\nA building collapses in Anamizu Town, Ishikawa Prefecture, on Jan. 2, 2024. An earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7.4 struck the Noto region of Ishikawa Prefecture, in central Japan, about 4:10 p.m. the previous day.\n\n(Noboru Hosono / Associated Press)\n\nDespite the current viral attention around the Tokara swarm, experts like Nishimura are more concerned with another, far more credible earthquake forecast that has loomed over the country for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, a government panel estimated that there is an 80% chance of a magnitude 8 to 9 megaquake on the Richter scale occurring along Japans Nankai Trough in the next 30 years.\n\nA 559-mile long fault line located off Japans Pacific coast characterized by its subduction, in which one tectonic plate is forced under another, the Nankai Trough has produced devastating earthquakes every 90 to 200 years. The last one occurred in 1946.\n\nUnder the governments worst-case scenario, the next Nankai megathrust earthquake is projected to kill about 300,000 people  most of them likely to perish in the tsunamis reaching as high as 100 feet  and cause up to $1.8 trillion in damage.\n\nBy comparison, the death toll for the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake  the two biggest seismic events in recent California history  was 63 and 57. In the meantime, experts are studying the southernmost tip of the San Andreas fault, which hasnt had an earthquake of 7 or larger since sometime between 1721 and 1731.\n\nA future great Nankai earthquake is surely the most long-anticipated earthquake in history  it is the original definition of the Big One, wrote geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A. Hubbard in 2024.\n\nEarlier this month, the Japanese government announced a series of countermeasures aimed at reducing the number of deaths by up to 80% and structural damage by 50%, including making buildings more earthquake-resistant and improving evacuation protocols.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is necessary for the nation, municipalities, companies and nonprofits to come together and take measures in order to save as many lives as possible, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said.\n\nBut Nishimura, the earthquake expert, says that more needs to be done to meet these ambitious targets.\n\nAlthough realizing the decrease in structural damage may be challenging due to a limited budget, reducing fatalities can be achieved through more soft-type countermeasures, such as training and evacuation drills, he said.\n\n"

        "content": "CNN \n\nThe top US Navy admiral ardently defended a non-binary sailor on Tuesday amid some criticism from Republican lawmakers, saying he is particularly proud of this sailor.\n\nThe sailor, LTJG Audrey Knutson, had their story shared on the Navys Instagram page last week. In a short video, Knutson said they are proud to serve as non-binary, especially because their grandfather served in the Navy as a gay man in World War II. During a deployment last fall aboard the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, Knutson said their highlight was reading a poem to the whole ship at an LGBTQ spoken word night. The Instagram video garnered nearly 17,000 likes.\n\nSubsequently, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, tweeted a portion of the clip with the caption, While China prepares for war, this is what they have our US Navy focused on. On Tuesday, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, continued attacking the video, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee he had a lot of problems with the video.\n\nBut Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday defended the sailor, emphasizing that its the job of a commanding officer to build a warfighting team.\n\nIll tell you why Im particularly proud of this sailor, Gilday told the hearing. So, her grandfather served during World War II, and he was gay and he was ostracized in the very institution that she not only joined and is proud to be a part of, but she volunteered to deploy on Ford and shell likely deploy again next month when Ford goes back to sea.\n\nGilday used female pronouns to refer to Knutson but the Navy told CNN Knutsons pronouns of choice are non-binary.\n\nWe ask people from all over the country, from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds to join us, Gilday said, and then its the job of a commanding officer to build a cohesive warfighting team thats going to follow the law, and the law requires that we be able to conduct prompt, sustained operations at sea. That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so  if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then Im proud to serve beside them.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have attacked the military for being too woke, claiming it has been one of the causes of the militarys poor recruiting numbers, despite a recent Army survey showing only 5% of potential recruits were concerned about wokeness.\n\nLast month, Republican Rep. Cory Mills and several others went after the Defense Department on its diversity, equity and inclusion training at a House Armed Services Subcommittee hearing on military personnel. Mills said, We absolutely 150% can out-pronoun every single one of our adversaries, and China and Russia Im sure are quaking in their boots over this.\n\nIn response, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros said diversity and equal opportunity training have been a part of the military for decades.\n\nAt another hearing in early-March with the militarys top enlisted leaders, Sgt. Maj. Of the Army Michael Grinston stressed that the militarys focus remains on combat lethality, even with additional training on diversity and inclusion.\n\nThere is one hour of equal opportunity training in basic training, and 92 hours of rifle marksmanship training, Grinston said at the time. And if you go to [One Station Unit Training], there is 165 hours of rifle marksmanship training and still only one hour of equal opportunity training."

        "content": "Senate Republicans hauled President Donald Trumps big tax breaks and spending cuts bill to passage on July 1 on the narrowest of margins, pushing past opposition from Democrats and their own Grand Old Party ranks after a turbulent overnight session.\n\nThe sudden outcome capped an unusually tense weekend of work at the Capitol, the presidents signature legislative priority teetering on the edge of approval or collapse. In the end, that tally was 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.\n\nThree Republican senators  Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, and Rand Paul of Kentucky  joined all Democrats in voting against it.\n\nThe big not so beautiful bill has passed, Mr. Paul said afterward.\n\nThe difficulty it took for Republicans, who have the majority hold in Congress, to wrestle the bill to this point is not expected to let up. The package now goes back to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson had warned senators not to overhaul what his chamber had already approved. But the Senate did make changes, particularly to Medicaid, risking more problems ahead. House GOP leaders said they would put it on Mr. Trumps desk by his Fourth of July deadline.\n\nIts a pivotal moment for the president and his party, as they have been consumed by the 940-page One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as its formally titled, and invested their political capital in delivering on the GOPs sweep of power in Washington.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged its very complicated stuff, as he departed the White House for Florida.\n\nI dont want to go too crazy with cuts, he said. I dont like cuts.\n\nWhat started as a routine but laborious day of amendment voting, in a process called vote-a-rama, spiraled into a round-the-clock slog as Republican leaders were buying time to shore up support.\n\nThe droning roll calls in the chamber belied the frenzied action to steady the bill. Grim-faced scenes played out on and off the Senate floor, amid exhaustion.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota worked around the clock desperately reaching for last-minute agreements between those in his party worried the bills reductions to Medicaid will leave millions more people without care and his most conservative flank, which wants even steeper cuts to hold down deficits ballooning with the tax cuts.\n\nIn the end, we got the job done, Mr. Thune said afterward.\n\nThe GOP leaders had no room to spare, with narrow majorities. Mr. Thune could lose no more than three Republican senators, and two  Mr. Tillis, who warned that millions of people will lose access to Medicaid health care, and Mr. Paul, who opposes raising the debt limit by $5 trillion  had already indicated opposition.\n\nAttention quickly turned to two other key senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Ms. Collins, who also raised concerns about health care cuts, as well as a loose coalition of four conservative GOP senators pushing for even steeper reductions.\n\nMs. Murkowski, in particular, became the subject of the GOP leaderships attention, as they sat beside her for talks. She was huddled intensely for more than an hour in the back of the chamber with others, scribbling notes on papers.\n\nThen all eyes were on Mr. Paul after he returned from a visit to Mr. Thunes office with a stunning offer that could win his vote. He had suggested substantially lowering the bills increase in the debt ceiling, according to two people familiar with the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said, Republicans are in shambles because they know the bill is so unpopular.\n\nAn analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. The CBO said the package would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the decade.\n\nSen. Angus Kaine, the independent from Maine, could be heard admonishing GOP colleagues as they exited the chamber: Shame on you guys.\n\nSenators insist on changes\n\nFew Republicans appeared fully satisfied as the final package emerged, in either the House or the Senate.\n\nMs. Collins fought to include $50 billion for a new rural hospital fund, but among the GOP senators, there were worries that the bills Medicaid provider cuts would be devastating and force them to close.\n\nWhile her amendment for the fund was rejected, the provision was inserted into the final bill. Still, she voted no.\n\nThe Maine senator said shes happy the bolstered funding was added, but my difficulties with the bill go far beyond that.\n\nAnd Ms. Murkowski called the decision-making process agonizing.\n\nShe secured provisions to spare Alaska and other states from some food stamp cuts, but her efforts to bolster Medicaid reimbursements fell short. She voted yes.\n\nWhats in the big bill\n\nAll told, the Senate bill includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, according to the latest CBO analysis, making permanent Mr. Trumps 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.\n\nThe Senate package would roll back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits, which Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide. It would impose $1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements on able-bodied people, including some parents and older Americans, making sign-up eligibility more stringent, and changing federal reimbursements to states.\n\nAdditionally, the bill would provide a $350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.\n\nDemocrats fighting all day and night\n\nUnable to stop the march toward passage, the Democrats tried to drag out the process, including a weekend reading of the full bill.\n\nA few of the Democratic amendments won support from a few Republicans, though almost none passed. More were considered in one of the longer such sessions in modern times.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, raised particular concern about the accounting method being used by the Republicans, which says the tax breaks from Mr. Trumps first term are now current policy and the cost of extending them should not be counted toward deficits.\n\nShe said that kind of magic math wont fly with Americans trying to balance their own household books.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press. AP writers Joey Cappelletti, Darlene Superville, Seung Min Kim, and Kevin Freking contributed to this report."

        "content": "Protesters in Tehran chant slogans Sunday in a protest after the U.S. attacks on nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nFallout from President Trumps historic gamble to strike Irans nuclear facilities reverberated across the Middle East Sunday, as Washington braced for an unpredictable response from a cornered but determined Islamic Republic.\n\nAlthough the Iranian government downplayed the impact of the U.S. attack, noting the depths of its nuclear know-how built over decades of study, U.S. military officials said the precision strikes against Irans three main nuclear facilities caused extremely severe damage and destruction.\n\nA senior Israeli official told The Times that Jerusalem was so satisfied with the operation that it was prepared to suspend hostilities if Iran ends its missile salvos against Israeli territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are ready to be done, said the Israeli official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nAs the dust settled, the sun rose and satellite imagery emerged of the wreckage, the main question among Trump administration officials became how Tehran would respond  both militarily, against U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf and around the world, as well as with the remnants of its nuclear program, with so much of it destroyed.\n\nTehrans nuclear-armed allies, in Russia and North Korea, have been critical of the military campaign, with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev raising the prospect of Moscow giving Iran a nuclear warhead in response to the attacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Israeli official dismissed that idea, alluding to direct talks with Moscow over the Iranian program. We are not concerned, the official said.\n\nPresident Trump addresses the nation Saturday night about the U.S. military strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites. He is accompanied by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State and national security advisor Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. (Carlos Barria / Pool Photo via Associated Press)\n\nTrumps military action, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, was a contingency years in the making, prepared and and assiduously avoided by his predecessors over two decades as a desperate last resort to a nuclear Iran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEver since Tehran resumed its fissile enrichment program in 2005, Republican and Democratic presidents alike have warned that the Islamic Republic could never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. But a constellation of diplomatic talks and complex agreements has failed to dissuade Tehran from a fundamental principle of a right to enrich uranium  near to weapons grade  on its own soil.\n\nDespite the dramatic nature of the air raid, few in Washington expressed an appetite for a prolonged U.S. war with Iran and echoed Israels interest in a truce after deeming its initial operations a success. Vice President JD Vance denied that the United States was at war with Iran on Sunday, telling CBS that the nation is, instead, at war with Irans nuclear program.\n\nBut the prospect of another full-scale U.S. war in the Middle East, made palpable by the weekend strikes, shook Capitol Hill on Sunday, compelling Democrats who have long advocated a tough approach to Iran to push for a vote to restrict Trump under the War Powers Act.\n\nMore than 60 members of Congress, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, called on the Trump administration to seek congressional authorization for any further action. At least one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, joined in the call.\n\nU.S. officials emphasized the precise nature of the strike Sunday, indicating the mission had been an isolated military operation with a narrow, if ambitious, goal. But Trump reinforced fears of a broader war on Sunday evening, writing on his social media platform that a change of government could become a policy goal of the administration.\n\nThe Pentagon said that seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers deployed a total of 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators  30,000-pound bombs known as bunker busters, for their ability to destroy facilities buried deep underground  against Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. operation followed an Israeli campaign that began last week with strikes against Iranian air defenses and nuclear facilities, scientists and research facilities, as well as against military generals, ballistic missile launch pads and storage depots.\n\nAlthough the U.S. and Israel believe that the American strikes were a strategic victory, some concern remains that Iran may have removed critical equipment and materiel from its site in Fordo  an enrichment facility built deep into the side of a mountain  to an undisclosed location before the U.S. operation began, the Israeli official said.\n\nThat remains a question mark, the official added, while expressing confidence that Israeli intelligence would be aware of any other significant nuclear facilities.\n\nAddressing the nation Saturday night about the attacks, Trump warned Iran that U.S. attacks could continue if it refuses to give up on its nuclear program.\n\nThere will be either peace, or there will be tragedy for Iran, far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days, Trump said, flanked by his vice president, national security advisor and Defense secretary. Remember, there are many targets left. Tonights was the most difficult of them all, by far, and perhaps the most lethal. But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.\n\nSatellite image shows the Natanz enrichment facility in Iran after U.S. strikes. (Maxar Technologies via Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcross the region Sunday, the question paramount on observers minds was what shape Irans response would take.\n\nIranian officials downplayed the strikes impact, acknowledging damage to nuclear facilities but that the know-how remained intact.\n\nThe U.S. and Israel should know this industry has roots in our country, and the roots of this national industry cannot be destroyed, said Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to a Sunday interview with the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency.\n\nOf course, we have suffered some losses, but this is not the first time that the industry has suffered damage.  Naturally, this industry must continue and its growth will not stop.\n\nHassan Abedini, the deputy political director of state broadcaster IRIB, said that the three targeted nuclear sites already had been emptied some time before the attacks and that they didnt suffer a major blow because the materials had already been taken out.\n\nOther officials, including leaders in the targeted areas in Natanz, Isfahan and Fordo, reassured residents that there was no nuclear contamination as a result of the strikes and that they could go on with their lives, according to a statement Sunday from government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. attacks drew swift pleas for restraint from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which both issued statements calling on all parties to de-escalate. Iraq, meanwhile, said the U.S. escalation constitutes a grave threat to peace and security in the Middle East, according to an interview with its government spokesman on Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera.\n\nOman, a key mediator in the negotiations between Tehran and Washington, was more scathing, expressing what it said was its denunciation and condemnation of the U.S. attacks.\n\nIn Europe, as well, governments urged caution and affirmed support for Israel.\n\nWe have consistently been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon and can no longer pose a threat to regional security, France, Germany and Italy, known as the E3, said in a statement. Our aim continues to be to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe last significant face-off between Iran and the United States happened during Trumps first term, when he ordered the assassination of top Iranian commander Gen. Qassem Suleimani in 2020.\n\nSatellite image shows a close view of the Isfahan nuclear technology facility in Iran after U.S. strikes. (Maxar Technologies via Associated Press)\n\nThat attack spurred predictions of a furious retaliation, with fears of Tehran deploying its missile arsenal or activating its network of regional militias to attack U.S. forces and interests across Washingtons footprint in the region. Instead, Tehran reacted with little more than an openly telegraphed ballistic missile barrage on a U.S. base in Iraq.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIrans options are even more limited this time. Much of that network  known as the Axis of Resistance and which included militias and pro-Tehran governments in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Afghanistan and Yemen  in incapacitated after more than 20 months of Israeli attacks.\n\nAllies such as Russia and China, despite issuing condemnations of the U.S. attack, appear to have little appetite for involvement beyond statements and offers of mediation. And how much remains of Tehrans missile arsenal is unclear, with the Israeli official estimating roughly 1,000 ballistic missiles  half of their capacity before the most recent conflict started  remaining available to them.\n\nNevertheless, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that the United States should expect regrettable responses.\n\nInstead of learning from repeated failures, Washington effectively placed itself on the front lines of aggression by directly attacking peaceful installations, Guard Corps said in a statement Sunday. It hinted that its targets would include U.S. military presence in the region.\n\nThe number, dispersion, and size of U.S. military bases in the region are not a strength, but have doubled their vulnerability, the statement said.\n\nThe United States has more than 40,000 troops stationed in the region, according to Pentagon figures, and has bases in at least 10 countries there, not to mention a significant presence at sea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet experts say the likeliest scenario would involve disruptions to shipping lanes, with Iran leveraging its control of the Strait of Hormuz, an oil transit chokepoint handling a fifth of the worlds energy flows, that is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point; or calling on Yemens Houthis to intensify their harassment campaign of merchant vessels on the Red Sea.\n\nIt is a situation in which Iran has experience: During its conflict with Iraq in the 1980s, Tehran engaged in the Tanker War, attacking hundreds of Iraqi ships near Hormuz and entering into direct confrontations with the U.S. Navy.\n\nShipping companies are already girding themselves for disruptions. But Danish shipping giant Maersk said it was continuing to use the Strait of Hormuz for the time being.\n\nWe will continuously monitor the security risk to our specific vessels in the region and are ready to take operational actions as needed, Maersk said in a statement.\n\nWilner reported from Washington and Bulos from Beirut."

        "content": "When it comes to vaccines, virtually nothing that comes out of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s mouth is true.\n\nThe man in charge of the nations health and well being is impervious to science, expertise and knowledge. His brand of arrogance is not just dangerous, it is lethal. Undermining trust in vaccines, he will have the blood of children around the world on his hands.\n\nScratch that.\n\nHe already does, as he presides over the second largest measles outbreak in this country since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter century ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVaccines have become a divisive issue in American politics, Kennedy wrote the other day in a Wall Street Journal essay, but there is one thing all parties can agree on: The U.S. faces a crisis of public trust.\n\nVoices Op-Comic: The birth of a spoiler Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blows into campaign 2024 on a famous name and some infamous views\n\nThe lack of self-awareness would be funny if it werent so tragic.\n\nOver the past two decades or so, Kennedy has done more than almost any other American to destroy the publics trust in vaccines and science. And now hes bemoaning the very thing he has helped cause.\n\nEarlier this month, Kennedy fired the 17 medical and public health experts of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  qualified doctors and public health experts  and replaced them with a group of (mostly) anti-vaxxers in order to pursue his relentless, ascientific crusade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, at its first meeting, his newly reconstituted council voted to ban the preservative thimerosal from the few remaining vaccines that contain it, despite many studies showing that thimerosal is safe. On that point, even the Food and Drug Administration website is blunt: A robust body of peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted in the U.S. and other countries support the safety of thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nIf you searched the world wide, you could not find a less suitable person to be leading healthcare efforts in the United States or the world, psychiatrist Allen Frances told NPR on Thursday. Frances, who chaired the task force that changed how the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, defines autism, published an essay in the New York Times on Monday explaining why the incidence of autism has increased but is neither an epidemic nor related to vaccines.\n\nThe rapid rise in autism cases is not because of vaccines or environmental toxins, Frances wrote, but is rather the result of changes in the way that autism is defined and assessed  changes that I helped put into place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Kennedy is not one to let the facts stand in the way of his cockamamie theories. Manufacturers long ago removed thimerosal from childhood vaccines because of unfounded fears it contained mercury that could accumulate in the brain and unfounded fears about a relationship between mercury and autism.\n\nVoices Abcarian: Another Big Lie: RFK Jr. wants to make America healthy again Kennedy is on a quest to dismantle a multitude of programs that help keep Americans alive and disease free.\n\nThat did not stop one of Kennedys new council members, Lyn Redwood, who once led Childrens Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, from declaring a victory for children.\n\nRemoving a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable population is a good place to start with making America healthy again, Redwood told the committee.\n\nAutism rates, by the way, have continued to climb despite the thimerosal ban. But fear not, gullible Americans, Kennedy has promised to pinpoint a cause for the complex condition by September!\n\nLike his boss, Kennedy just makes stuff up.\n\nOn Wednesday, he halted a $1-billion American commitment to Gavi, an organization that provides vaccines to millions of children around the world, wrongly accusing the group of failing to investigate adverse reactions to the diptheria vaccine.\n\nThis is utterly disastrous for children around the world and for public health, Atul Gawande, a surgeon who worked in the Biden administration, told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnilaterally, and contrary to the evidence, Kennedy decided to abandon the CDC recommendation that healthy pregnant women receive COVID vaccines. But an unvaccinated pregnant womans COVID infection can lead to serious health problems for her newborn. In fact, a study last year found that babies born to such mothers had unusually high rates of respiratory distress at or just after birth. According to the CDC, nearly 90% of babies who were hospitalized for COVID-19 had unvaccinated mothers. Also, vaccinated moms can pass protective antibodies to their fetuses, who will not be able to get a COVID shot until they are 6 months old.\n\nVoices Abcarian: The governments pronatalism warps family values If Trump and Musk want Americans to have more children, they should stop the stunts and make life easier for families.\n\nWhat else? Oh yes: Kennedy once told podcaster Joe Rogan that the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic was vaccine-induced flu even though no flu vaccine existed at the time.\n\nHe also told Rogan that a 2003 study by physician scientist Michael Pichichero, an expert on the use of thimerosal in vaccines, involved feeding babies 6 months old and younger mercury-contaminated tuna sandwiches, and that 64 days later, the mercury was still in their system. Who would do that? Kennedy demanded.\n\nWell, no one.\n\nIn the study, 40 babies were injected with vaccines containing thimerosal, while a control group of 21 babies got shots that did not contain the preservative. None was fed tuna. Ethylmercury, the form of mercury in thimerosal, the researchers concluded, seems to be eliminated from blood rapidly via the stools. (BTW, the mercury found in fish is methylmercury, a different chemical, which can damage the brain and nervous system. In a 2012 deposition for his divorce, which was revealed last year, Kennedy said he suffered memory loss and brain fog from mercury poisoning caused by eating too much tuna fish. He also revealed he has a dead worm in his brain.)\n\nVoices Abcarian: Kennedys hypocritical approach to public health puts us all at risk Its folly to focus on artificial food dyes while undermining vaccination science and firing those charged with real work that keeps us healthy and safe.\n\nKennedys tuna sandwich anecdote on Rogans podcast was a ChatGPT-level of hallucination, said Morgan McSweeney, a.k.a. Dr. Noc, a scientist with a doctorate in pharmaceutical sciences, focusing on immunology and antibodies. McSweeney debunks the idiotic medical claims of non-scientists like Kennedy in his popular social media videos.\n\nSpeaking of AI hallucinations, on Tuesday, at a congressional committee hearing, Kennedy was questioned about inaccuracies, misinformation and made up research and citations for nonexistent studies in the first report from his Make America Healthy Again Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report focused on how American children are being harmed by their poor diets, exposure to environmental toxins and, predictably, over-vaccination. It was immediately savaged by experts. This is not an evidence-based report, and for all practical purposes, it should be junked at this point, Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Assn. told the Washington Post.\n\nIf Kennedy was sincere about improving the health of American children he would focus on combating real scourges like gun violence, drug overdoses, depression, poverty and lack of access to preventive healthcare. He would be fighting the proposed cuts to Medicaid tooth and nail.\n\nDo you suppose he even knows that over the past 50 years, the lives of an estimated 154 million children have been saved by vaccines?\n\nOr that he cares?\n\n@rabcarian.bsky.social\n\n@rabcarian\n\n"

        "content": "U.S. Coast Guard aids in rescue operation following floods in central Texas\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAs we just heard, first responders are still searching for people who are missing after the floods that swept Central Texas. Among those searching are members of the U.S. Coast Guard. Commander Nathan Shakespeare is the Coast Guard air operations officer overseeing the Guard's response. He's at the Coast Guard base in Corpus Christi, and he was nice enough to take a few minutes to talk to us on the line now. Good morning, Commander. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\nNATHAN SHAKESPEARE: Good morning, Michel. Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: Can you describe the scope of operations that the Coast Guard has been conducting near Kerrville?\n\nSHAKESPEARE: Yeah, absolutely. The Coast Guard's - very quickly on Friday morning was notified about the response. And we maintain two assets on ready status all the time, so we launched our ready helicopter here in Corpus to head that way. It's 150 miles inland, so it's quite the trek for the Coast Guard and not an area that we're used to operating.\n\nMARTIN: Wow.\n\nSHAKESPEARE: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah, I never thought about that. Do you have any sense of how many people the Coast Guard has helped to locate so far?\n\nSHAKESPEARE: Sure, absolutely. So, I mean, I think everyone's seen in the media the fantastic work of AST3 Ruskan. So on the ground here, he did the 165 number that's floating around. He helped those folks load into some partner helicopters, a Coast Guard Dolphin. Ian, Blair and Seth, the rest of AST3 Ruskan's crew, rescued 15 that day, and then we saved or assisted another seven people.\n\nMARTIN: Wow.\n\nSHAKESPEARE: So we were really, like, the very - kind of the bleeding edge of the response. We had the most impact.\n\nMARTIN: You sure did. But can you just describe - like, is there a particular rescue or coordinated effort that stands out for you over these last several days where - you know, recognizing that, you know, the entire team is, you know, participating and helping in this effort. But can you just, you know, give us one story?\n\nSHAKESPEARE: Sure, absolutely. So I would say the thing that's really sticking out to me is just the fantastic work from Ian and the crew to get the helicopter 150 miles inland in some really atrocious weather conditions and try to get on scene. So initially, they took off from Corpus and tried to fly low, working up the valleys. But the rain was so thick and the clouds so low, they ended up having to - punching into the clouds inadvertently and climbing up, diverting to San Antonio. They tried to go above the clouds and do an instrument approach in the helicopter down to Kerrville. And unfortunately, the intensity of the rain, working with the air traffic control, was just too much. They were unable to punch through the weather at altitude, so they diverted for a second time.\n\nOn their third attempt to go in, they kind of tried to loop in from the southwest of the storm and then were unsuccessful then again because of the extreme weather. And only on the fourth time were Ian and the crew able to work up a valley and make it into the operating area and make it to Camp Mystic to begin their operation. So just - it's a little tough to describe it in the truncated time here. But, you know, taking off at 6:30 a.m. in the morning and then getting on scene seven hours later, with four different kind of bites at the apple, trying to - trying really hard to get the helicopter and the air crew in to effect some rescues - a Herculean effort.\n\nMARTIN: I think you did a great job describing it. I mean, I think I get the picture. And it sounds incredible, required incredible skill and incredible training, and, you know, thank you all for this work. But can I just ask you this? The logistics of this are hard enough. Can - how about the emotional toll of this?\n\nSHAKESPEARE: Sure, absolutely. I would say the interesting thing about that is just how much control we have and how much visibility we have. So the Coast Guard is so oriented to our ability to support operations kind of at the shore and looking offshore. So, you know, we're kind of in contact with Ian and the crew throughout the day for their attempts to get in, and trying to do some coaching and help and kind of validate the plan and the assumptions as they're working their way inland. And then, at least for me, kind of an emotional toll as they get on scene. The communications are just so limited for the Coast Guard there that once he's on scene, you really - we have no idea what they're doing. You know, we - they're flying so low that we - they're not on air traffic control radar. We don't...\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nSHAKESPEARE: ...Have communications with them, and, you know, we're not texting our crews in the plane. So really kind of just a lot of trust in the crew, once they took off on that fourth leg, that they were going to make it in there and make an impact. So I talked to Ian the next time after he's on deck in Kerrville, and he had left Ruskan on scene. But the helicopter had ran out of gas, so they were getting gas. I got a - kind of a quick brief from Ian on his plan and his intentions, and he took off back again. So there was really no discussion at the time about, like, the impact or the number of life saves. Everything's very mission-focused...\n\nMARTIN: OK.\n\nSHAKESPEARE: ...And kind of how we're going to accomplish the next step.\n\nMARTIN: Well, thank you so much for sharing this, and thank you for your service and that of your other colleagues and teammates. We all appreciate it, and we're all thinking of you. That's Air Operations Officer Nathan Shakespeare. He's been leading U.S. Coast Guard rescue operations in Texas. Commander, thank you so much.\n\nSHAKESPEARE: Absolutely. Thanks for having me.\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Sunday in the Park With George, currently playing in a limited run at New Yorks Hudson Theatre starring Jake Gyllenhaal, is blissfully free of politicsa two-and-a-half hour respite from contemporary anxieties, a holiday on the banks of the Seine, bathed in sunlight and glorious harmony. And yet, without ever straining to, it makes one of the most persuasive cases imaginable for the power of artists, and how deeply integral their work is to a well-ordered society. Art shows us, as Gyllenhaals George demonstrates to his mother in one of the first acts most moving songs, how life can be beautiful.\n\nBut rather than simply celebrating the fruits of creative labor, Sunday in the Park is a testament to the process of making art; a substantial peek inside the mind of someone wrestling with their own genius. When the showwith music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapinedebuted in 1984, it was interpreted as one of Sondheims most personal expressions, coming on the heels of his critical and financial bomb, Merrily We Roll Along. George, the shows hero, is obsessed with his paintings, to the detriment of everything else in his life. But as the show unfolds, moving from 19th-century France to 1980s Chicago, it explores the reasoning behind his single-minded fixation, and how Georges role as an observer lets everyone else see the world differently, too.\n\nThats largely because this revival, directed by Sarna Lapine (James Lapines niece), is so magnificent and so emotionally rich, anchored by performances by Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford as Georges mistress and artists model, Dot. The show is based around Georges Seurats 1884 pointillist masterwork, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, and George is a loose version of Seurat, with his life broadly fictionalized. As he sketches studies of Dot, who grumbles about the discomfort, the heat, and Georges fierce focus on his work, projections of his sketches appear on a backdrop onstage, rendered for the audience to witness in real time. All the while George narrates his thought process: the challenge of bringing order and harmony to a blank canvas.\n\nGyllenhaals gifts as an actor are well-documented by now, so its his vocal talents that may come as a surprise (observe, if you havent already, Cary Fukunagas short video of Gyllenhaal singing Georges Finishing the Hat at the Hudson). His voice is rich, measured, and emphatic. But its the acting behind it that really cuts deep, in a remarkable fusion of technical accomplishment and intense absorption in a role. When he sings about mapping out a sky, sensing voices outside but being totally lost in focus, dizzy from the height of falling back to earth, youre tempted, like Dot, to forgive him everything.\n\nAshford, who won a Tony for the 2014 revival of the daffy comedy You Cant Take It With You, is Georges perfect foil as Dot: sassy, practical, and infinitely charming. But she also conveys the exquisite pain of loving someone so inaccessible, and her chemistry with Gyllenhaal is pure. Toward the end of the first act, when George directs the many elements and characters to come together in a synergy of music and visuals, he places Dot at the front of the painting, as if to keep her close. But the supporting cast, too, are adept at bringing comic relief, and balancing the harmony of the show: Robert Sean Leonard as Jules, an accomplished artist; Penny Fuller as Georges mother, lost in nostalgia; Phillip Boykin as a foulmouthed and obstreperous boatman. The peripheral characters by their nature are fleeting archetypes, included to provide contrast with the more textured portrayals of George and Dot.\n\nThe second act of Sunday in the Park, which leaps ahead to 1984with Gyllenhaal playing another artist named George and Ashford his grandmother, Marie, Dots daughterhas often seemed jarring after the perfection of the first act, but Lapine manages to make the two halves more symbiotic by emphasizing how Georges art is tied to his great-grandfathers. Just as Seurat used pointillism and the science of light to create new colors and impressions, 1984 George debuts a light installation called a chromolume at the Art Institute of Chicago. The work, created by the scenic designer Beowulf Boritt, looms above the audience in a dazzling display of illuminations, weaving and undulating overhead. Ashford, seamlessly segueing into playing a 90-year-old southern grandmother, spells out Georges isolation and creative frustration in Children and Art, a song addressed to her mother in the painting. The cracks in her vocals, and the deliberate weakness of Maries voice, make it one of the most moving numbers in the show.\n\nModern Georges frustrations are different but rooted in the same fearsunlike his great-grandfather, he has to fundraise for his expensive, technologically advanced works, and respond to the criticism it inevitably receives. But in the song Move On, it becomes clear that the two are one and the same, straining to make art that counts, and to do something new. The resolution in the show comes from realizing that just doing the work is enougheverything else is out of an artists hands. This production, so deftly directed, emphasizes both the value in the struggle, and the timelessness of great art. Its powerful indeed to have the experience, even briefly, of seeing the world through the eyes of a visionary."

        "content": "The young man said hes lived in fear ever since he developed an addiction to drugs and later fell prey to drug trafficking in Guanajuato, central Mexico. Unfortunately, theyve already killed my best friend and my relatives, said the 19-year-old, whose name is being withheld since he's afraid of reprisals.\n\nDrug addiction led me to a critical condition. I couldnt find a way out, and I was scared, he told Noticias Telemundo.\n\nA year ago, he managed to escape from a panic house (also known as panicueva, or panic cave) commonly used by organized crime gangs in Mexico. Some of these buildings, located in Guanajuato and other states where drug use is rampant, also serve as recruitment bases for young people selected to become hit men and operatives for these criminal groups.\n\nA young man from Guanajuato who lived in one of the \"panic houses\" during an interview with Noticias Telemundo. Noticias Telemundo\n\nIts the place where you can go, buy your drugs, and get high right there, said another 19-year-old who managed to escape a panic house and was interviewed by Noticias Telemundo on the condition that he remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.\n\n\"I entered a panic house and saw several women who had to prostitute themselves, and several of my friends got involved in selling drugs and ended up being killed, said the young man. He said he spent five years living in one of the houses and eventually joined a local gang.\n\nAccording to the latest report issued by the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the highest number of homicides (980 from January to April). In February, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.\n\n\"They've put a gun to my head, theyve threatened me, theyve told me Im done, thats it. But the most horrible thing Ive seen is how they killed my best friend, the young man said, referring to his experience in the shelters.\n\nI was required to do many things ... they send us to train to use a firearm, all of that comes together and from there come the hit men, from there come the thieves, the hawks, he said, referring to the murderers, thieves and drug traffickers.\n\n'They are recruiting more minors'\n\nGuanajuato is grappling with gang clashes over criminal activities such as fuel trafficking, and is also the epicenter of a growing methamphetamine epidemic. According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health, the addiction rate to this drug in the state grew 449% over the past 20 years.\n\nFor David Miranda, a counselor at the Las Joyas de Len Addiction Assistance Center, a civil association, the rise in methamphetamine use is creating a social crisis in the state.\n\n\"They're recruiting more minors, ages 12 to 17, Miranda said. Within these 'panic houses,' they recruit many minors who are now hit men.\n\nNoticias Telemundo visited the Las Joyas neighborhood in the municipality of Len, where, according to the states Security Secretariat, criminal groups have taken over a 380-unit housing complex.\n\nInside a \"panic house\" in Len, Guanajuato. Noticias Telemundo\n\nThe situation in Len right now is demanding and very serious, Miranda said. Inside those houses there are women, girls, minors, and you see drug trafficking, trafficking of women, trafficking of everything.\"\n\nMost panic houses are in working-class neighborhoods like Las Joyas. According to the state government, there could be up to 60,000 homes across Guanajuato currently being used for illegal drug use.\n\nIn fact, you can see a panic house on any corner, anywhere. Its very easy to find them. There are many abandoned houses, one of the young men interviewed by Noticias Telemundo said.\n\n'I dont want to be caught again'\n\nAccording to state figures, at least 10 people have been murdered in panic houses in the last two years, and around 400 neighborhoods in the state are struggling with high crime rates.\n\nLen is the number one city in terms of drug dealing, said Juan Mauro Gonzlez, Guanajuatos secretary of security.\n\n\"Drug houses\" arent unique to Mexico; similar trends exist in other countries, such as drug houses in the United States or drug dens in Spain. While criminals may be attracted to abandoned houses, these are also spaces where potential victims and criminals tend to converge without surveillance. Our results support the idea that abandoned houses also generate crime, said Lauren C. Porter, a professor at the University of Maryland who co-wrote a study on the issue.\n\n\"The most important thing to rehabilitate people is to change their mindset. They have to say they dont want that anymore, that they no longer want to suffer or be in that world where they were humiliated, abused, and forced to do things. They should want a different life; we do the rest and we help them, said Miranda, who said his addiction center has a capacity to serve 150 people.\n\nMeanwhile, young people like the ones interviewed by Noticias Telemundo continue to struggle to avoid falling back into addiction and the dangers of the \"haunted houses\" that abound on some areas of Guanajuato.\n\nIm scared. I dont want them to catch me again and force me to do things, said one of the men, who told Noticias Telemundo he wants to move to another neighborhood and have an honest job as a pizza maker, as he enjoys feeding people.\n\nMy life is already very ruined, I was very humiliated, he said. Its time to make a change.\n\nAn earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo."

        "content": "House Democrats on Tuesday demanded that the justice department release documents related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epsteins sex-trafficking case that mentions or references Donald Trump, citing a comment by Elon Musk after he fell out with the president this year.\n\nThe House judiciary committees ranking member, Jamie Raskin, together with 15 other Democrats sent a six-page letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, accusing her of withholding some Epstein files to protect the president from any damaging disclosures.\n\nThey also called for the justice department to make public the second volume of former special counsel Jack Smiths report into Trumps alleged mishandling of classified documents, arguing that Bondi has a track record of using the justice department to protect the president.\n\nStop protecting your boss and former client, release the Smith report in full without redactions immediately, and publicly release all documents in the Epstein files that mention or reference Donald Trump, the letter said.\n\nNo evidence has emerged to suggest Trump was connected to Epstein any more than has already become public, apart from a since-deleted X post by Elon Musk as he exited the White House under a cloud of controversy and accused the justice department of trying to insulate Trump from the matter.\n\nTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public, Musk wrote in his post in June.\n\nThe missive to Bondi came a day after the justice department and the FBI issued a memo that concluded that no secret client list of Epstein existed and reaffirmed the conclusion reached by federal investigators in 2019 that he died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell awaiting trial.\n\nThe justice department also released video surveillance of the hallway outside of Epsteins cell, although the digital clock on the tape skipped from 11:58:58pm to 12:00am. Officials did not address the jump and added that no further materials would be made public.\n\nThis administration has repeatedly claimed that President Trump is the most transparent and accessible president in American history. So far, your DOJ has not only failed to live up to this promise, but you have also consistently hidden from the American public materials and information that may be damaging to President Trump, the letter said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Epstein file binders on 27 February 2025. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nThe release of the Epstein files has become an unlikely goal for the Trump administration after Bondi spent months hyping up the materials as being full of damaging details related to child porn and sex trafficking, creating anticipation among a core group of the presidents supporters.\n\nThe release of the first batch of documents related to the files, handed out to handpicked Trump-world personalities at the White House in white binders bearing the imprimatur of the justice departments seal, prompted widespread derision for containing no new information.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The justice departments Monday memo undercut Bondis own statements and repeated conclusions reached by federal investigators years earlier.\n\nWith Democrats in the minority, the request for the Epstein files or the second volume of Smiths final report into the classified documents case is almost certain to go unanswered. It was not clear whether Republicans on the committee would join the request.\n\nRepublicans on the House judiciary committee have instead focused their time investigating the justice departments criminal cases against Trump. The Guardian previously reported in May that the committee interviewed former classified documents case prosecutor Jay Bratt.\n\nIn that appearance, Bratt asserted his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, which a spokesperson said he chose to do because this administration and its proxies have made no effort to hide their willingness to weaponize the machinery of government against those they perceive as political enemies."

        "content": "In 1981, I was a student of art history at Columbia University. I was twenty-one and worked to support myself at a variety of jobs. Columbia was an all-boys school then. Old oak desks and a million cigarettes. (You could smoke in class.) I didnt know much about the universitynot even that it was an all-boys universityuntil I got there. It was a new world for me. I had lived most of my life until then in a family of girls. Now there was a family of boys.\n\nI didnt live on campus. I lived with my aunt, my uncle, and an adored older female cousin in Brooklyn. At around that time, Our Ma, inspired by her sister and eldest daughter, was planning on moving from Brooklyn, where I grew up, to Atlanta. A new start. She was just over fifty then. She made it clear that there were certain rules I had to follow if I was going to stay with my aunts family. I had to pay rent, twenty dollars a week. Nobody lives for free, Our Ma said.\n\nAt first, my aunt objected to the mandate: I was just a schoolkid. But Our Ma was adamant; it was either that or I would come and live with her and my little brother in Georgia. There were several reasons that my mother put her foot down. One was Daddy. As long as shed known him, hed lived rent-free with his mother, whose economic smarts my mother revered. Mrs. Williams could throw a handful of peas in a pot and feed a whole army, Our Ma said. Mrs. Williams had a husband and two other childrentwo girlsbut, for her, Daddy always came first.\n\nOur Ma did not want me to be some version of my father, a guy who could love women less and get more from them because of thatnot if she had anything to do with it. And she did have something to do with it, with everything. She was raised in a societya West Indian societythat did not put much of a premium on womens bodies, where any kind of intimacy was a joke. People made fun of you for expressing longing, or, if you were a man, for being involved with just one woman, or for showing affection to your children.\n\nFor a long stretch of his life, Daddy had two women to nurture himMrs. Williams and my motherbut Our Ma had only one enormous love: others. She believed in community, and wanted us all to belong to it, even Daddy, despite the fact that he was living at his mothers house and had been born into a family that laughed at her goodness.\n\nOur Ma may have had a devalued body, in the world she came from, but she fought for and retained her right to put her foot down. And, when she put it down, the world was different. After she put her foot down, I went to school and went to work. Every week I paid my aunt rent. In my room in her house, I had a desk, piles of books, and a typewriter. I tried to write. I was going to write.\n\nLife at Columbia was strange. All those boys. I could smell them. So many of them in their bodies, careless with their scent. They lifted their arms up and, kingdom come, the air was different. The gay ones were less apt to reek. That would be impolite, and already life had proved to be impolite, having produced queer bodies in 1981, for instance. We gay boys were only a decade or so removed from Stonewall and two decades removed from being blackmailed or jailed for solicitation, so caution and madness were in our bones. Sometimes we committed great acts of love or rage in private, while the only public trespass we allowed ourselves was to throw glittering hard words into the air, hoping they would not rebound and chop us off at the knees.\n\nI had never seen so many rich, or rich to me, people in one place before. I was amazed, first, by their hair. For years, Our Ma had made her, and our, living as a hairdresser. Her clients were all Black women. So many words and worries in their hair. The Columbia boys hair was so lustrous and well nourished. They had good teeth and healthy bodies and strong nipples that were on display on sunny days when, sitting on the campus steps, they removed their shirts, and not one of them, among the straight ones, at least, looked ashamed. Theyd grown up playing tennis or squash in Connecticut, or Rhode Island, or farther north. In the summer, they went to the Cape. Their families knew one another and this was a source of casual pride among them, not of bitter jokes or distancing resentments.\n\nManhattan had always belonged to my father. He used to take me and my little brother to foreign movies and then to eat foreign food. He was deeply unconcerned about the staring white people wondering what we were doing in a tearoom, say, on the Upper East Side. We ate blintzes in Germantown, and caught Liv Ullmann in The Emigrants. Then Daddy took us home to Crown Heights, and, for a while, it felt like Sweden.\n\nAt Columbia, I didnt have to pretend that I was somewhere else; I was somewhere else. All of itthe grand buildings, the wave upon wave of stone stepswas like a stage set for becoming. But becoming what? Daddy had given me Manhattan, and now I took to it without him. He had no active role in this New Yorkin my New Yorkand perhaps that in itself was an act of becoming for me.\n\nEverything was so queer, or I wanted it to be. I dont mean queer like campa loyal adherence to the artificialbut queer like my mind, which was interested in all that was misshapen. In this new, unfamiliar place, I felt freer to go on about the things that excited me, just as I had with my older sisters when I was a boy, before they put an end to all thatbecause what was I turning into, some kind of faggot?\n\nCartoon by Glen Baxter Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nIn my family, I never answered the what-are-you-some-kind-of-faggot question, because I couldnt trust anyone with the answer. Theres not a fag who grew up in East New York or Crown Heights in the nineteen-sixties and seventies who would have trusted the inhabitants of those worlds with the knowledge that he was gay.\n\nIn the West Indian community, Our Ma knew one sort-of-out guy. He never said that he was gay, but he communicated it through his fastidious love of women and the fact that he lived in Manhattan. He loved my motherthey were distant cousins, I thinkand when he came to visit I heard family members, neighbors, and the like refer to him as an auntie man. To them, he wasnt just a queen. He was every queen they had ever known and despised, been disgusted and amused by, secretly had and then spat upon, dismissed and jeered at. Because thats how prejudice works: you are one thing that represents all bad things to others. Didnt the elders describe racism that way? But gay was not a skin color. It was a state of being, a consciousness that took your raceor anything else that life had given youand made it different. My ability, as an auntie man, to love those who considered me a pariah, or some kind of wicked novelty act, told me that fags were made of different stuffbut what stuff?\n\nIt happened the way love happenswhile youre least expecting it though wanting everything. I had been at Columbia for a semester or so when I fell in with a small group of guys, most of whom, like me, were studying art history. The most interesting of them was from Orange County, California, the son of a single mother who worked as a nurse at Disneyland. He had pale skin that flushed easily, curly dark-blond hair, and beautiful handsthick Daddy hands, but gestural, femme like that. He was a brilliant reader of philosophy, and made me want to read more seriously and widely.\n\nRoland Barthes had landed with a boom on Columbias academic planet years before and he was beloved by that group of guys. My smart friend read him and imitated his aphoristic stylea new way of being an author. But, for me, Barthess writing was like the finest embroidery stitched in the air: only the author could see it. And what did all this talk about the other actually mean?\n\nOne reason those queens loved Barthes, I think, without entirely understanding structuralism as a discipline, was that he was so elusive about being queer. They were, too. Despite Stonewall and other political advances, my new friends were barely out of the closet (and some never left it). They had grown up in parts of America that, in 1981, were still ideologically 1956.\n\nWe had an intense philological relationship, my blond friend and I. I remember how delicately he handled the paperback copy of Toni Morrisons Sula I lent him, and how interested he was to hear about my father and how he had been spoiled by his mother, just as Milkman Dead had in Morrisons Song of Solomon.\n\nWe passed books back and forth, back and forth, and the words in them made the ground more solid beneath our feet. I kept trying with Barthes because I loved my friend and found something I recognized in the emotional language in Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes and A Lovers Discourse. Actually, in the former book, it was really just a photograph and the line introducing it that got me. The picture, black-and-white, showed a young Barthes being held in his mothers arms. He was too big to be carried, but his mother managed him with no sign of complaint or surprise. The four wordsThe demand for loveexpressed a world: this was me, and all of us, with Our Mas. What soul doesnt want to be carried, held, well past the carrying age?\n\nIn A Lovers Discourse, I was taken by Barthess interpretation of the cry of love: I want to understand myself, to make myself understood, make myself known, be embraced; I want someone to take me with him. Indeed, I wanted my bookish friend to take me into his mind, to discover stories with me, to elevate me with his thought, and to join me in my disco of community. In that imagined disco, there was a select crowd, largely queer. The hall was small, and honestly what it looked like was a home. At my disco of community, the d.j. played Chaka Khan, Prince, Philip Glasss Einstein on the Beach, Jane Olivor singing Some Enchanted Evening, the Voices of East Harlem declaring, Right On Be Free, Dionne Warwick asking us to take a Message to Michael, Bowie, of course, singing Station to Station, Labelle describing how Going Down Makes Me Shiver, and Elton, Elton singing so many things. All these songs were, of course, one songa song of wishingand they filled the room so mightily it was as if God were stepping tall around our dance hall. God could be your own queer self, too, and you could even do the Latin hustle with Her, surrounded by all the other folks and things you loved that made you feel panic-stricken because wasnt love a panic?\n\nMy book buddy had a boyfriend. Lets call him LES. He had grown up in a block of buildings known as affordable housing on the Lower East Side, with his white single mother, a social worker. LES did not know his father, who was Black. He was the only other person of color in that group of gay boys at Columbia, and, given the cultural loneliness I presumed he felt and Our Mas fidelity to spiritual strays, I felt obliged to love him. For a long time I thought I did because I thought I should.\n\nWe were not attracted to each other sexually. From the first, our connection and uneasiness were familial, not romantic. LES was interested in class, not as a way of eradicating his race but as a way of catapulting himself out of his background. At Columbia, he wanted not to be his origin story; he was all about the arrival myth. He outdid the white boys at being a white boy. Brusque in manner, he embraced capitalisms lack of charity: there was room for only one class, and that class was acquisitive and brutal in its grab for the worldmore was more. This was in the era of Lacoste shirts, chinos, and L. L. Bean leather bags and boots. Somehow, LESs Lacoste shirt collars stood up straighter and stiffer than any of those other guys."

The question came as reporters clustered around the president on the White House lawn to watch the installation of a flagpole.\n\nThe Paramount-Skydance deal has been pending at the Federal Communications Commission since late last fall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump said he hoped the deal goes through.\n\nEllison is great. Hell do a great job with it, Trump said.\n\nThen he appeared to connect the merger-review delay to his lawsuit against CBS and its parent Paramount over last falls 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has maintained since last October that the Harris interview was edited to burnish her chances in the November election. CBS has denied the allegations, saying the edits were routine. The raw footage showed Harris was accurately quoted, but Trumps team said he suffered mental anguish from the broadcast.\n\nThey interviewed Kamala. Her answer was horrendous, Trump said Wednesday. I would say election-threatening. ... Her answer was election-threatening it was so incompetent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1st Amendment experts have called Trumps case frivolous, but Paramount wants to avoid waging an extensive legal fight. Paramounts leaders have pursued a settlement to help clear a path for the companys sale to Skydance  a deal that needs the approval of the FCC.\n\nThe mediation process to resolve the lawsuit, filed in a Texas court, has become protracted.\n\nTheyre working on a settlement, Trump said Wednesday. He mentioned that two high-level CBS executives  the head of CBS News and the executive producer of 60 Minutes  had abruptly departed as the merger review dragged on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheyre all getting fired, he said.\n\nLate last week, Trumps legal team filed court documents asking for a deadline extension in the discovery process, disclosing the two sides were working to reach a resolution.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellison met Trump briefly while the two men were sitting ringside at a UFC fight in New Jersey, according to video footage shared online. Skydance declined to discuss Ellisons interaction with Trump.\n\nIt marked the second time this year that Ellison chatted with the president at a UFC match. The first was in April.\n\nIts been nearly a year since Paramounts controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and fellow Paramount directors approved the two-phased $8-billion deal that will hand the company to the son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison, who is a Trump supporter.\n\nThe deal will also see the Ellison family buy the Redstone investment vehicle, National Amusements Inc.\n\nSanta Monica-based Skydance intends to consolidate the company that boasts the Melrose Avenue Paramount film studio, Paramount+ streaming service, CBS and cable channels including Comedy Central, Showtime and BET.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkydance operations and personnel will be folded into Paramount.\n\nThe deal faces one final regulatory hurdle: FCC Chairman Brendan Carrs consent to transfer 29 CBS television station licenses to the Ellisons from the Redstones.\n\nThis week, the Senate approved Trumps second Republican appointment to the panel, Olivia Trusty.\n\n"

        "content": "CNN \n\nRepublicans on Tuesday formally blocked a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee, something Democrats hoped to do in order to advance stalled judicial nominations.\n\nSenate Democrats are seeking to temporarily replace Feinstein on the powerful panel that processes judicial nominees as the California Democrat remains absent, recovering from shingles.\n\nSenate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly.\n\nFeinsteins return date is still unclear and she asked just last week to be temporarily replaced on the committee as she recovers.\n\nSchumer introduced his motion on Tuesday by talking about his friendship with Feinstein, and highlighting her accomplishments.\n\nToday, I am acting not just as Leader but as Diannes friend, in honoring her wishes, until she returns to the Senate, Schumer said.\n\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, objected to Schumers request, though he also praised the California Democrat. He argued that Schumers move is to get more judges confirmed.\n\nShes a dear friend and we hope for her speedy recovery and return back to the Senate. With all due respect, my colleague, Senator Schumer, this is about a handful of judges that you cant get the votes for, Graham said.\n\nDemocrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and its unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success.\n\nFeinstein, who has already announced shes not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington by the end of the March work period, but that her return got delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.\n\nShe recently said she plans to return as soon as possible once my medical team advises that its safe for me to travel.\n\nCardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since shes been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns.\n\nI recognize the importance of the numbers on the committee, and this way we can be able to conduct business. I look at this as a way of dealing with a current situation, Cardin said.\n\nDemocrats would need 60 votes to replace Feinstein on the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Feinstein does not return soon, at least 12 nominees, or possibly even more, could be stalled.\n\nIf Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted  both on the committee and on the Senate floor.\n\nAsked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she cant return by May, Schumer responded that hes hopeful she will return very soon.\n\nLook, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon, Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol.\n\nFeinstein announced in February that she would not run for reelection, and a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary.\n\nMany congressional Democrats have remained largely supportive of her decision to remain in office while absent from the Capitol as she recovers from shingles.\n\nBut Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats  and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin recently acknowledged to CNN that Feinsteins absence had slowed down the partys push to confirm nominees. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that the rain can fall on both sides of the road.\n\nAsked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, Yes, of course it does, pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn, a senior member on the Judiciary Committee and close adviser to McConnell, told CNN that he opposes the effort to replace Feinstein on the panel.\n\nI dont think Republicans can or should help President Bidens most controversial nominees, the Texas Republican said. I support having Sen. Feinstein come back as soon as she can. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I dont think you can expect any Republican cooperation.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

        "content": "A Ukrainian actress saw herself in a White House video  and created one in response\n\ntoggle caption Screenshot by NPR\n\nKYIV, Ukraine  A social media video promoting President Trump's tax bill is getting a lot of attention in Ukraine. The reason involves a TV star, a mission and a powerful Ukrainian weapon  humor.\n\nLast week, the White House posted a video on its official Instagram page, showing a woman working at a computer late at night.\n\n\"Work more, keep more,\" the subtitles read. \"No tax on overtime, courtesy of the one big beautiful bill.\"\n\nThe post received hundreds of comments. Many were from Ukrainians. \"That's our Motrya,\" they wrote.\n\nMotrya  played by Antonina Khyzhniak, a well-known Ukrainian actress  is a character from Spiymaty Kaidasha , To Catch the Kaidash, a 2020 Ukrainian TV drama series.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSpeaking with NPR by phone, Khyzhniak recalls the day in late June when her smartphone started pinging nonstop.\n\n\"I was bombarded with hundreds of messages, tags and comments, \" she says. \"I did not understand what was happening and where this video came from.\"\n\nAt first Khyzhniak thought it might have been made using artificial intelligence. But the interior, clothes and laptop looked so familiar. Then she remembered: she had taken part in a video shoot to generate stock footage which can be purchased and is often not copyrighted.\n\nIt wasn't digital magic: it was part of her real life as an actress.\n\nA celebrity in her homeland, Khyzhniak knew how to make the most of the moment. She made her own video, appearing as both herself and President Trump. Her portrayal of the U.S. president involves using an animation of his face on her body and imitating his voice.\n\nIn the video, Khyzhniak acts out an imaginary negotiation between herself and Trump.\n\n\"I need your face,\" Khzhniak's Trump says.\n\n\"I need. 5 Patriots,\" she responds.\n\n\"Deal! Yes!\"\n\nPatriots are state-of-the-art, American-made air defense systems that help protect Ukraine from Russian attacks. Now that these attacks have been escalating for months, Ukraine needs more Patriots.\n\nKhyzhniak tells NPR that her video, though seemingly lighthearted, was an opportunity to talk about what Ukrainians are going through.\n\n\"You fall asleep and you don't know whether you will wake up, whether you will be lucky in this lottery to survive,\" she says.\n\nOn July 1, the White House announced that it is stopping some weapons shipments, including air defense missiles that have been already promised to Ukraine.\n\nBefore this decision, Khyzhniak had joked that maybe one day she could speak with Trump for real.\n\nAnd  in another joke  she made clear in the video and in her NPR interview that she'd dress the part.\n\nMany Ukrainians were shocked in February when a Trump-aligned cable news correspondent mocked Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a White House visit for not wearing business attire  even though the Ukrainian president is world-famous for wearing combat-style black, gray or khaki cargo pants and sweatshirts decorated with Ukrainian national symbols, to show he is leading a nation at war.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKhyzhniak suggested she would dress in a way to deflect any sartorial outrage, should she get a negotiations invite.\n\n\"Well, I do have a suit,\" she laughed. \"I'm ready to go.\""

More than 60 bands and 2,000 participants are expected to begin their march through the town streets shortly after thousands of spectators would be leaving the sold-out Royal Portrush, if organisers stuck to typical tee times.\n\nThe R&A has been concerned for some time about the logistical challenges associated with the simultaneous events on Saturday week. Significant congestion for people leaving the course, or thousands choosing to depart early to avoid this, have been uppermost in the thoughts of the major tournaments organisers.\n\nIt was reported last month that the Portrush Sons of Ulster, who organise the parade, voted against rearranging their march despite a request from the R&A. The third round of the Open would ordinarily finish at 8pm BST, with the parade due to commence at 8.15pm.\n\nThe R&A would not comment specifically on its preparations. It is understood, however, that tee times will be adjusted. The R&A said: We are working on plans to minimise disruption for our fans leaving the championship due to the event taking place in Portrush.\n\nHow much leeway the R&A has remains to be seen because of live American television coverage requirements. The time change is therefore unlikely to be big, but any alteration would be notable.\n\nR&A officials had promised previously to explore potential mitigations to ensure fans can get home smoothly following the end of play. Standard adult tickets for round three cost more than 120. The 153rd staging of the Open, which runs from 17 to 20 July, will be the biggest sporting event to take place in Northern Ireland.\n\nMeanwhile, before the Scottish Open this week, Xander Schauffele has backed Keegan Bradleys bid to be a playing captain for the US in the Ryder Cup in September.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekends action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "content": "In a controversial decision, the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday sided with the Trump administration as it limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide procedural rulings. The high court granted the administrations request to scale back nationwide injunctions. It also partially green-lit, for now, a Trump policy that seeks to change who can be born American.\n\nIn a press conference after the ruling, President Donald Trump praised the court. The 6-3 decision  which divided the justices along ideological lines  is a monumental victory that is based on common sense, he said. He singled out Justice Amy Coney Barrett, one of his appointees and the author of the majority opinion, for writing a brilliant decision.\n\nTo supporters, Fridays decision represents a common-sense effort to dial back the injunctions and judge-shopping that both parties have decried in recent years. For critics, it erodes constitutional protections and presents an existential threat to the rule of law, as one dissenting justice put it.\n\nWhy We Wrote This To supporters, Fridays decision represents a commonsense effort to dial back the injunctions that both parties have decried. For critics, it erodes constitutional protections and presents an existential threat to the rule of law.\n\nThe shape-shifting case has been litigated since late January, when Mr. Trump issued an executive order reinterpreting the 14th Amendments guarantee of birthright citizenship. But what began as a run-of-the-mill constitutional dispute morphed into an argument over the procedural powers of federal courts, specifically the power of District Courts to issue temporary relief affecting the entire country.\n\nThat judicial power now appears to be upended. Meanwhile, the question of whether President Trump can redefine birthright citizenship will continue to make its way through the courts. The executive order is now set to take temporary effect in 30 days, at least in the 28 states that have not sued the government.\n\nLower courts may further determine the extent of the rollout. Meanwhile, some immigrant advocates have already renewed their request to block the policy, by refiling their lawsuit as a class action. And with respect to nationwide injunctions, Justice Barrett included a caveat: One could be necessary to create complete relief, she wrote, directing lower courts to address that question.\n\nIt is a major victory for the Trump administration, but it is qualified, says Keith Bybee, director of the Institute for the Study of the Judiciary, Politics & the Media at Syracuse University. Its sort of an inside-out ruling from the court, he adds.\n\nMost people want to know whether the president can take away automatic citizenship, he continues, but The courts saying, Thats not the question were going to answer. Instead, the court opted to address how to scale back judicial authority.\n\nBut by allowing a potential patchwork of policy rollouts across the country, says Professor Bybee, The court has now created the conditions for some significant disorder.\n\nThe bottom line on injunctions\n\nThe case, Trump v. CASA Inc., followed a rare path to the high court.\n\nEarlier this year, multiple federal district and appeals courts ruled that Mr. Trumps executive order redefining birthright citizenship is likely unconstitutional. Normally, the government would then ask the Supreme Court to overturn those rulings. Instead, the Trump administration asked the justices to narrow the nationwide injunctions.\n\nThe White House has argued for months that federal judges have been abusing their power by issuing rulings temporarily blocking its aggressive immigration policies. With mixed results, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to unfreeze certain policies. Mr. Trump notched a victory Monday, as the court approved third country deportations despite immigrants advocates due process concerns.\n\nOn Friday, the justices limited lower courts ability to issue far-reaching injunctions.\n\nThe issuance of a universal injunction can be justified only as an exercise of equitable authority, yet Congress has granted federal courts no such power, wrote Justice Barrett in the majority opinion. Equitable authority refers to the flexibility courts have in coming up with fair remedies to injustices. While courts have broad discretion to determine those remedies, they also have limits.\n\nThough flexible, this equitable authority is not freewheeling, she wrote.\n\nAnd the bottom line, she added, is that the universal injunction was conspicuously nonexistent for most of our Nations history.\n\nThat procedural tool can act as an advantage to the party that does not control the executive branch, because it can try to wield injunctions to stymie executive actions, says Professor Bybee.\n\nKen Cedeno/Reuters President Donald Trump speaks at a White House press conference as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche listen, after the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of judges to issue nationwide injunctions, in Washington, June 27, 2025.\n\nBut if you are not confident that your party will always control it, then you should be kind of limited in your criticism of universal junctions, he says. Because you may come to rely on them in the near future.\n\nThe three liberal justices were blistering in their dissents. Fridays decision, rather than a measured partial stay, represents an existential threat to the rule of law, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote.\n\nNo right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates, wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who read her dissent from the bench. Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\n\nThe majority of the court got it right, says Paul Larkin, the Rumpel senior legal research fellow at The Heritage Foundation. The publics views on birthright citizenship as a hot-button issue, he says, seem to have overcome their views on the sort of structural or procedural issue that was involved in this case.\n\nThe constitutionality of the Trump order can still wend its way through courts, he says. You can get these issues resolved  its just that you cant do it in a New York second.\n\nIts true that courts can still stop enforcement of the birthright citizenship order, which remains unconstitutional, says Alicia Bannon, director of the judiciary program at the Brennan Center for Justice. But The court did limit a very important tool that the judiciary has to address illegal activities.\n\nThere was no reason for [the Supreme Court] to take this case up now, says Ms. Bannon, who notes that courts have issued universal injunctions for decades.\n\nSpecific to the injunctions at issue in the birthright citizenship case, Justice Barrett offered focused guidance to the lower courts. They are stayed only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue, she wrote.\n\nLower courts in Washington, Massachusetts, and Maryland  to which these cases will now return  shall move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule.\n\nHow to define birthright citizenship?\n\nSince the end of the Civil War, birthright citizenship has been a constitutional guarantee for virtually everyone born in the U.S. The 14th Amendment grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. A Supreme Court case decided in 1898 affirmed that this right applies to U.S.-born children of noncitizens.\n\nModern legal theories challenging this tradition have emerged since the 1980s. Related Republican-led bills have failed in Congress. These theories essentially hold that the language subject to the jurisdiction thereof excludes the children of parents who are in the country unlawfully.\n\nPresident Trumps executive order would make those theories a reality. The Jan. 20 order says children of parents here unlawfully or temporarily (such as on a visa) are excluded from automatic U.S. citizenship.\n\nLawsuits against the government quickly followed, and Trump v. CASA is actually three cases combined. The plaintiffs  pregnant immigrants, immigrant advocacy groups, and 22 states  won overlapping, nationwide injunctions from three federal District Courts. Those judges found the Trump order likely unconstitutional, and their rulings were affirmed by three appellate courts.\n\nIn what it called a modest request, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to narrow the injunctions to apply only to the plaintiffs  instead of to the whole country. The Trump administration argued that it was unable to create public guidance about how [executive agencies] would implement the birthright order because of the nationwide injunctions.\n\nThe administration did not argue that Mr. Trumps birthright citizenship order is constitutional, and the six-justice majority on Friday did not comment on that question. In the principal dissent, Justice Sotomayor addressed that elephant in the room.\n\nThe majority ignores entirely whether the Presidents Executive Order is constitutional, she wrote.\n\nThe government says It should be able to apply the Citizenship Order (whose legality it does not defend) to everyone except the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit, she added. The gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the Government makes no attempt to hide it. Yet, shamefully, this Court plays along.\n\nRise of class actions?\n\nWith lower courts authority to issue nationwide injunctions now drastically curbed, the Supreme Court identified one prominent alternative: nationwide class actions. Such class actions, governed by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, require plaintiffs to clear more procedural hurdles than in seeking a nationwide injunction.\n\nThis difficulty, the majority wrote, is exactly the point. By forging a shortcut to relief that benefits parties and nonparties alike, universal injunctions impermissibly circumvent Rule 23s procedural protections, wrote Justice Barrett.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito cautioned that lower courts should maintain those strict procedures governing certification of nationwide class actions.\n\nWithout scrupulous adherence to those requirements, he wrote, the universal injunction will return from the grave under the guise of nationwide class relief.\n\nWithin hours of Fridays decision, immigrant groups in Maryland and New Hampshire sought to refile their cases as class actions that would prevent the government from enforcing the birthright citizenship order against any member of the class anywhere in the country."

No one was hurt.\n\nThe bombings remain seared into London's collective memory, and the anniversary will be marked with a ceremony at the 7/7 memorial in Hyde Park and a service of commemoration at St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nIn a message, the king said his \"heartfelt thoughts and special prayers remain with all those whose lives were forever changed on that terrible summer's day.\"\n\nHe said the country could take heart from the bravery of the emergency services and others who responded to the attack, and \"the countless stories of extraordinary courage and compassion that emerged from the darkness of that day.\"\n\nCharles also hailed the \"spirit of unity that has helped London, and our nation, to heal.\"\n\n\"As we remember those we lost, let us, therefore, use this 20th anniversary to reaffirm our commitment to building a society where people of all faiths and backgrounds can live together with mutual respect and understanding, always standing firm against those who would seek to divide us,\" he said.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said July 7, 2005 was one of Britain's \"darkest days.\"\n\nShe said that 20 years on, \"Islamist extremist terrorism remains the greatest threat\" to national security \"followed by extreme right-wing terrorism.\"\n\n\"But we also face hybrid threats to our national security from hostile states, serious organized crime, cyber criminals, those threatening our border security and a troubling rise in violence-fixated individuals radicalized online,\" she wrote in the Sunday Mirror newspaper, adding that the government would \"relentlessly confront and counter threats to our national security.\""

        "content": "Ten years ago Thursday, the Supreme Court enshrined same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. Obergefell v. Hodges enabled LGBTQ+ couples to gain legal protections on a host of issues from parenting and health care to taxes and rights of survivorship.\n\nAlthough his name is now synonymous with the push for marriage equality, Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the landmark case, never expected to become an activist.\n\nIn 2011, Mr. Obergefells late husband, John Arthur, was diagnosed with a terminal illness. The couple, who had been together for over two decades, married in Maryland two years later. But they soon realized that their home state of Ohio  which did not recognize same-sex unions  would not list Mr. Obergefell as Mr. Arthurs surviving spouse.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Ten years ago, the Supreme Court issued the landmark decision Obergefell v. Hodges, making same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states. Jim Obergefell says the legal fight was about protecting the dignity and equality of people like him and his late husband.\n\nThat kicked off a campaign that would profoundly change the lives of LGBTQ+ Americans, who had long fought for  and, in 36 states, won  the right to wed. The couple sued Ohio that year, notching a win in district court before an appeals court reversed the decision. By the time the case reached the Supreme Court in fall of 2014, more than a dozen couples had joined the suit.\n\nMr. Obergefell says he and Mr. Arthur fought not just for the right to call each other husband, but also for dignity  for themselves, and for the many other same-sex couples whose love the law did not recognize.\n\nJohn wanted to die a married man, Mr. Obergefell says in a phone interview with the Monitor. And I wanted the right to call myself his widower and have it mean exactly what it means to everyone else.\n\nMr. Obergefell won that right in 2015, two years after Mr. Arthur died. When the court announced its decision, Mr. Obergefell said he hoped that the country would soon reach a day when gay marriage became known simply as marriage. Today, he celebrates the strides the United States has made toward that vision. A sizable majority  68% of Americans  say same-sex marriages should be legal, according to polling from Gallup.\n\nYet Mr. Obergefell and other LGBTQ+ people and activists worry that marriage equality remains on shaky ground. This year, some Republican lawmakers have introduced state legislation asking the Supreme Court to overturn its previous decision as flawed.\n\nIn the following interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Mr. Obergefell shares his views about the progress the country has made toward equality and what this polarized moment in U.S. politics might mean for the future of LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nWhat was it like to be at the center of such a historic and consequential Supreme Court case?\n\nUnexpected. Overwhelming in some ways. But also just such, such a joy to be part of something that made a huge difference in our nation and, you know, had such a positive impact on so many people across the country. Boy, what a wonderful experience it was.\n\nRick Bowmer/AP/File Jim Obergefell speaks during a news conference at the Utah State Capitol, June 7, 2022, in Salt Lake City. We need states across this country to say we see you, you exist. You deserve respect. You deserve protections, because your relationship is no different than any other, said Mr. Obergefell. That year, Congress passed the Respect for Marriage Act, which enshrines protections for same-sex and interracial marriages.\n\nHow would you describe that experience?\n\nYou know, it was really the chance to meet people across the country. As the case was going, people would recognize me, and they would come up to me and want to shake my hand, share a story, share photos, tell me about their loved one, about their spouse, about their partner, about their kid.\n\nIt was a gift every single time it happened. And the fact that I had parents stop me and say, Hey, Jim, could we take a photo of you with our child? Because thanks to you and the other people in this case, we know our kid can marry the person they love, whomever that happens to be. I had closeted queer kids come out to me. Theyd never come out to anyone before, but they came out to me.\n\nWhat is it like for you now, to be reflecting on that case 10 years on?\n\nFor me, it goes back to part of my comments in front of the Supreme Court after the decision: You know, I look forward to the day when this is not same-sex marriage or gay marriage, its just marriage. And in so many ways that has happened because people across the country  family members, neighbors, coworkers  they know someone who has married someone because of this decision. So its become just marriage. And I love that.\n\nHonestly, it was a really easy decision. The most important person in my life, the person I love the most, was dying. And we had wanted to get married since the mid-90s.\n\nWe had to do all of these things that millions of other people never had to think about or consider. Being forced to go to another state to get a marriage license. Figuring out how to take a dying man with no physical abilities to another state to do something, again, that millions of others took for granted. So we met this attorney, Al Gerhardstein, and he said, You know, you guys have a problem. When John dies, his last record as a person, his last records as an Ohioan, will be wrong. Because Ohio will completely ignore your lawful Maryland marriage on his death certificate.\n\nWe just wanted to exist. John wanted to die a married man, and I wanted him to die a married man. And I wanted that right to call myself his widower and have it mean exactly what it means to anyone else. We wanted to use the word husband and have it mean what every other person in this country thinks of when they say the word husband.\n\nWhat was it like to not have those legal protections?\n\nSomething can happen at any point. A car accident. And hospital staff could completely ignore the spouse, even though they have a lawful marriage in another state. They could ignore that spouse, prevent that spouse from seeing the person who is in medical distress, and they could absolutely refuse to take any direction from that lawful spouse. So thats just another issue that people dont think about.\n\nSame with a same-sex couple with kids. Well, if that state only allows one parents name on that birth certificate, what happens if that parent dies? What happens to that kid? What happens to the relationship with the only other parent theyve known? Marriage, and the lawful recognition of marriage, has such an impact on so many parts of our lives. But honestly, for John and me, it was all about dignity.\n\nIn the latest Gallup poll, 68% of adults said they support gay marriage. What do you think of that shift?\n\nWell, it makes me happy. I can also say Im not surprised. Because like anything, when there is a segment of society that a lot of people dont know  you know, they cant say, Oh, I have friends, or a family member who is queer, who is married. Or, I have a friend who happens to be [transgender]. When people cant say that, they create these images, these ideas of what people who are different are like. And those images are used in harmful ways because theyre not accurate. And its how entire communities of people are \"othered\" by people in the majority.\n\nSo with same-sex marriage its become such a part of all of our communities. And the otherness of it has been diminished. So yeah, it makes me happy. Do I wish the percentage who support marriage equality were higher? Of course, but Ill take every step in the right direction that we get in this country.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers and Supreme Court justices have openly signaled a desire to return to that ruling. Im wondering what you think about that, as well the recent Supreme Court decision regarding trans rights.\n\nYou know, what it all comes down to for me is, Why? How did any queer marriage or how does any queer marriage impact another person or another marriage? It doesnt. I just dont understand it.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the trans community is bearing the brunt of so much of the hate that is out there in our nation. Attempts to ban life-saving, gender-affirming care. Bans on bathroom use, bans on trans kids playing sports, all of these things, theyre not helping the nation. They are not making life better for anyone. All theyre doing is making life significantly worse for the trans community and the people who love them, for their parents.\n\nI dont understand this need to other people, to demean people, to attack people because they happen to be different in a way that doesnt matter. Were all human beings.\n\nDo you have anything that you would say to the people who are trying to relitigate same-sex marriage?\n\nI would just remind them that, you know, in our nations history, people fled the Old World to come to the New World for religious freedom because they were persecuted in the Old World for their religious beliefs. And thats what religious freedom in this country is supposed to be, where you can worship the way you want to in your home, in your place of worship, but youre not using your particular religious belief to persecute others.\n\nA few years ago, lawmakers  with bipartisan support  codified some protections for same-sex and interracial couples into law, with the Respect for Marriage Act. Did that allay any of your concerns?\n\nYes and no. I mean, I love that that act was passed into law, and the fact that it was bipartisan is a great thing. But if Obergefell is overturned, even with the Respect for Marriage Act in place, we no longer have marriage equality. The Respect For Marriage Act simply requires all states to recognize all marriages. But once again, people living in Ohio and other places could be denied a marriage license and the right to get married in the state they call home. That isnt marriage equality.\n\nWhat would you say to same-sex couples navigating the current climate?\n\nJohn and I were what I like to call quiet activists. We lived our lives openly. Every single person who met us, whether that was a neighbor, a stranger, a coworker, they knew we were a couple. We helped change hearts and minds, I think. I choose to believe we did. Because we were just ourselves. We were open, and we helped break down some of those harmful preconceived notions. So be an activist in whatever way works for you. Be authentic.\n\nAnd make sure you vote because voting is the only way we can ensure that our elected officials actually see every person in this country as part of We the People. And if we dont vote, were allowing other people to determine our worth, our value, our rights as a human being."

        "content": "At CIA headquarters, beyond the handsome granite seal on its lobby floor and a wall of stars carved in honor of the agencys fallen, experts are at work in the complex tasks of spycraft: weapons-trained officers, computer engineers, virologists, nuclear scientists.\n\nBut there are also storytellers, makeup artists, theater majors and ballerinas  Americans who probably never thought their skills would match the needs of a spy agency. Yet the CIA thought otherwise.\n\nThough it rarely gets the spotlight, theres a revolving door of talent between the countrys premiere intelligence agency and its entertainment industry, with inspiration and influence often working both ways.\n\nThe agency is targeting professionals at the intersection of arts and technology for recruitment, CIA officers told The Times, and continues to cooperate with entertainment giants to inspire the next generation of creative spies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis month, the agency is assisting a New York Times bestselling author on a young adult book examining the foundations of the CIA laid during World War II. Scenes from a major upcoming film production were just shot at its headquarters, a logistical feat at an intelligence campus tucked away in the Virginia suburbs behind rings of security perimeters, where officers roam cracking down on Bluetooth signals. Another popular streaming TV series will be back at Langley to film this fall.\n\nBut their collaboration goes far deeper than that, officers said. Creative minds in Hollywood and the entertainment industry have long had a role at the Central Intelligence Agency, devising clever solutions to its most vexing problems, such as perfecting the art of disguise and harnessing a magicians ability to cast spellbinding illusions. Indeed, in the 1950s, a magician from New York named John Mulholland was secretly contracted with the agency to write a manual for Cold War spies on trickery and deception.\n\nThese days, the officers said, creative skills are more valuable than ever in such a technologically complex world.\n\nYoure only limited by your own imagination  dont self-censor your ideas, said Janelle, a CIA public affairs officer, granted the ability to speak under her first name at the request of the agency. Were always looking for partners.\n\nAn elusive history\n\nDavid McCloskey, a former CIA analyst and author of Damascus Station and other spy thrillers, offered several theories on why the agency might be interested in fostering a robust relationship with Hollywood, calling it a two-way street.\n\nThere definitely have been operational applications for espionage, McCloskey said. Its probably the exception to the rule, but when it happens, its compelling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts easy to see why CIA leaders would be interested in Hollywood, he said, in part to shape impressions of the agency. But their bread and butter business is receiving people to give secrets, he continued, and part of that is getting close to people in power.\n\nThe closer you are to Hollywood, McCloskey added, thats a really interesting in to having a lot of interesting conversations.\n\nThe CIAs mission to rescue six American diplomats out of Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis, the subject of the film Argo, featured a detailed ruse centered around a fabricated movie project. (CIA Museum)\n\nSome of the CIAs most iconic missions  at least the declassified ones  document the agencys rich history with Hollywood, including Canadian Caper, when CIA operatives disguised themselves as a film crew to rescue six American diplomats in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis, an operation moviegoers will recognize as the plot of Argo.\n\nArgo was almost too far-fetched to even believe, said Brent, an in-house historian at CIA headquarters. Its almost more Hollywood than Hollywood.\n\nCanadian Caper was both inspired by Hollywood and relied on Hollywood talent. Agent Tony Mendez had been a graphic artist before joining the agency and helping craft the mission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother key player was John Chambers, the makeup artist who gave the world Spocks ears on Star Trek and won an honorary Oscar for his trailblazing simian work on Planet of the Apes. He was awarded the CIAs Intelligence Medal of Merit for his work on the covert rescue effort.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times broke the story in February 1975 that business tycoon Howard Hughes had lent his ship, the Glomar Explorer, as cover for a CIA operation. (CIA Museum)\n\nJust a few years before, Howard Hughes, then one of the worlds richest men and a tycoon in media, film and aerospace, agreed to work with the CIA to provide cover for an effort by the agency to lift a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine off the floor of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDeploying Hughes Glomar Explorer under the guise of mineral extraction, the CIA was able to salvage most of the sub before The Times broke a story blowing its cover  the story that sunk our efforts, in CIA parlance.\n\nAnd another mission was made possible thanks to a device invented by a professional photographer  a gadget that later became the inspiration of an over-the-top scene in the blockbuster Batman film The Dark Knight.\n\nIn Project Coldfeet, CIA agents gathering intelligence on a Soviet station erected on a precariously drifting sheet of ice in the Arctic needed a reliable extraction plan. But how does one pick up an agent without landing a plane on the ice?\n\nThe answer was the skyhook: Balloons lifted a tether attached to a harness worn by an agent high into the sky. A CIA plane snagged the tether and carried the agent off to safety.\n\nIn The Dark Knight, Batman makes a dramatic escape deploying the same kind of balloon-harness contraption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe superhero spy\n\nCIA leadership often says that acceptance into the agency is harder than getting into Harvard and Yale combined. Yet the agency still has challenges recruiting the type of talent it is looking for  either in reaching those with unconventional skills, or in convincing them that they should leave secure, comparatively well-paid, comfortable jobs for a secretive life of public service.\n\nIt is no easy task managing work at the agency, especially with family, CIA officials acknowledged. Deciding if and when to share ones true identity with their children is a regular struggle. But Janelle said the CIA tells potential recruits there is a middle ground that doesnt require them to entirely abandon their existing lives.\n\nA professional photographer working with the CIA invented what became known as the skyhook, a surface-to-air recovery system used by the spy agency in an Arctic mission and later featured in the 2008 Batman film The Dark Knight. (CIA Museum)\n\nPeople dont have to leave their companies to help their country and to work with CIA, Janelle said. People come here because they love their country and know they can make a difference.\n\nJanelle is part of a team that regularly engages with creatives who want to portray the agency or spies as accurately as possible.\n\nSome producers and directors reach out and they do care about accuracy, Janelle said, but they ultimately pick and choose whats going to work for the film or show.\n\nCIA analysts have also been known to leave the agency for opportunities in the entertainment industry, writing books and scripts drawing from their experiences  so long as they dont track too closely with those experiences.\n\nJoe Weisberg, the writer and producer behind the television series The Americans, and McCloskey, who is working on a fifth novel focused on U.S. and British intelligence, were both part of the agency before launching their writing careers. And as CIA alumni, they had to submit their works for review.\n\nTheres a whole publication and classification-review process, Brent said.\n\nThat process can be a bit of a slog, McCloskey said: They quite literally redact in black ink.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is far more difficult for nonfiction writers than novelists.\n\nThere could be bits of tradecraft, or alluding to assets, or people at the agency, which are clear nos, McCloskey said. But with novels, its not that hard to write them in a way to get them through the review board.\n\nTry as they may, studios often repeat the same falsehoods about the CIA, no matter how often they are corrected. Officers and agents arent the same thing, for one. And as disappointing as it may be for lovers of spy thrillers, the majority of officers are not licensed or trained to carry weapons.\n\nOne thing Hollywood often gets wrong is the idea that its one officer doing everything, when its really a team sport here, Janelle said.\n\nJessica Chastain, center, plays a member of the elite team of spies and military operatives who secretly devoted themselves to finding Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in the Columbia Pictures 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty. (Jonathan Olley / Sony Pictures)\n\nZero Dark Thirty, an Oscar-winning film released in 2012 about the hunt for Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, was widely acclaimed but criticized by some within the intelligence community over the credit it lends a single, fictional CIA analyst for tracking him down.\n\nMcCloskey sympathizes with the writers dilemma.\n\nI cant have 35 people on a team. From a storytelling standpoint, it just doesnt work, he said, acknowledging that little in the field of espionage is accurately captured on screen, even though there are plenty of former spies available to work as consultants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheres no lack of sources to get it right, he said. Its that the superhero spy  the Jack Ryans and Jason Bournes  are pretty much the Hollywood representation of espionage.\n\nHowever inaccurately glorified and dramatized, the agency hopes that Hollywoods work can keep the revolving door moving, inspiring atypical talent to join its ranks.\n\nWe have architects, carpenters, people who worked in logistics, Brent said. People might not realize the range of skill sets here at CIA.\n\nAnd as Canadian Caper showed, sometimes spycraft requires stagecraft. Its possible that whats needed most to complete the next mission wont be oceanography or data mining, but costume design. Or maybe another ballerina."

        "content": "WASHINGTON  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., broke the record for the longest House floor speech ever on Thursday, blasting Republicans and delaying the passage of their sweeping tax and spending bill for over eight hours.\n\nDuring his speech, which kicked off just before 5 a.m., the Democratic leader slammed the GOP bill, often referencing a series of binders as he read notes from Americans who he said would be harmed by Medicaid and SNAP benefit cuts.\n\nHe ended his 8-hour 44-minute speech shortly after 1:30 p.m., yielding back with rapturous applause from Democrats who chanted his name and embraced him.\n\nThe President Donald Trump-backed big, beautiful bill was poised to pass the House after several Republican holdouts flipped their votes overnight to support advancing the bill. Jeffries speech is part of the debate over the bill, and while it is unlikely he will be able to flip GOP votes, his speech can delay the voting timeline.\n\nJeffries closed by referencing remarks by Martin Luther King Jr., who had urged people to press on and keep pressing.\n\nAs I take my seat, I just want to say to the American people that no matter what the outcome is on this singular day, were going to press on, he said, going on to list more than a dozen groups he would press on for.\n\nPress on for the left behind, he said, as lawmakers echoed his call. Press on for the rule of law. Press on for the American way of life. Press on for democracy. Were going to press on until victory is won. I yield back.\n\nThe minority leader also referenced the 2026 midterms during his final minutes of the speech. He nodded to Republican goals in Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint, noting that the Declaration of Independence framers were fed up with Project 1775, and so they implemented Project 1776.\n\nI know that there are people concerned with whats happening in America, but understand what our journey teaches us is that after Project 2025 comes Project 2026.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., followed Jeffries speech, blasting the minority leader as delivering eight hours of hogwash.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also took a jab, saying that unlike the Democratic leader, Im going to honor my colleagues time and be a little more brief than that.\n\nHouse leaders have unlimited speaking time on the floor, using a procedure called a magic minute. The previous record for the longest House floor speech was in 2021, when then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., spoke for 8 hours and 32 minutes in opposition to Democrats' Build Back Better plan.\n\nJeffries noted during his speech that he was taking his sweet time on behalf of the American people.\n\nWhat is contemplated in this one big, ugly bill is wrong. Its dangerous, and its cruel, and cruelty should not be either the objective or the outcome of legislation that we consider here in the United States House of Representatives, Jeffries said, arguing that it was cruel to cut Medicaid.\n\nDemocrats repeatedly broke into resounding applause throughout Jeffries speech, chanting his name and embracing him in hugs after he finished speaking.\n\nThe minority leader zeroed in on the bills impact on Medicaid recipients, reading notes from people who rely on government health care programs or have family on Medicaid.\n\nAbove all else, Im just thankful for the spirit, the heart and soul of the American people who have risen up throughout this country to make it clear to all of us in this institution: Keep your hands off our Medicaid. Keep your hands off our health care, Jeffries said.\n\nThe Senate version of the bill would lead to nearly 12 million people losing health insurance over the next 10 years because of Medicaid cuts, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It would institute work requirements for able-bodied adults under 65 years old  a key Republican priority  and it would alter the way states fund Medicaid.\n\nThe bill also includes huge funding increases for immigration enforcement and the military and would cut Biden-era clean energy tax credits, among other provisions.\n\nJeffries framed the bill as Republicans trying to take a chainsaw to social safety net programs.\n\nRepublicans are trying to take a chain saw to Social Security, a chain saw to Medicare, a chain saw to Medicaid, a chain saw to the health care of the American people, a chain saw to nutritional assistance for hungry children, a chain saw to farm country and a chain saw to vulnerable Americans, Jeffries said.\n\nThe minority leader also touched on other Democratic priorities, criticizing Trump's tariffs and the administration's handling of deportations.\n\nThe White House criticized Jeffries' speech, arguing that he was \"bloviating\" to delay the bill's passage.\n\n\"He wants America to fail but @POTUS will ensure America succeeds,\" said the White House's rapid response team in a post to X.\n\nThe Democratic leader's speech comes months after Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., set the record for the longest Senate speech, at more than 25 hours."

        "content": "Paramount late Tuesday agreed to a landmark settlement with Trump to end his $20-billion broadside against CBS News.\n\nCritics blasted Paramount Globals decision to pay $16 million to settle President Trumps lawsuit over 60 Minutes edits, calling the move a spineless capitulation that erodes U.S. press freedoms.\n\nParamount late Tuesday agreed to a landmark settlement with Trump to end his $20-billion broadside against CBS News. The president will not be paid directly, or indirectly, as part of the deal, Paramount said. Instead, the money will go to cover Trumps legal fees and help finance his future presidential library.\n\nParamounts leaders hope the settlement will help clear a path for Trump-appointed regulators to bless the companys $8-billion sale to David Ellisons Skydance Media. They wanted to tamp down tensions with the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut journalists and others on Wednesday said the payment will embolden attacks by Trump and his allies on news outlets. Some called the settlement a stain on the proud legacy of CBS News, the onetime home of such fearless journalists as Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite and Mike Wallace.\n\nThis is a shameful decision by Paramount, Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders USA, said in a statement. Shari Redstone and Paramounts board should have stood by CBS journalists and the integrity of press freedom. Instead, they chose to reward Donald Trump for his petty legal assault.\n\nTrumps legal team quickly celebrated the settlement, saying: President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the non-profit 1st Amendment advocacy organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, took an opposing view, saying wider repercussions would result.\n\nA cold wind just blew through every newsroom, Corn-Revere said in a statement. Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the medias editor-in-chief.\n\nFederal Communications Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, said the settlement was a desperate move [by Paramount] to appease the Administration and secure regulatory approval of a major transaction currently pending before the FCC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment marks a dangerous precedent for the 1st Amendment, and it should alarm anyone who values a free and independent press, Gomez said.\n\nFor months, Paramount executives have been torn over how to handle Trumps $20-billion lawsuit. The dispute helped prompt the departure of two senior CBS News executives who tried to hold their ground, particularly as 60 Minutes continued airing stories that took a hard look at Trumps policies and actions.\n\nJournalists were horrified by the boards willingness to settle the case rather than defend 1st Amendment freedoms.\n\nCBS News staffers feared the company would be forced to apologize when they said they did nothing wrong. (The settlement, negotiated through a mediator, did not require an apology.)\n\nThe legal wrangling began in October when CBS broadcast different portions of an answer given by then-Vice President Kamala Harris to a question about the Biden administrations waning clout with Israels prime minister.\n\nCBS Face the Nation program ran a clip of Harris giving a muddled response to the question. A day later, 60 Minutes aired a different portion of her answer. This one was forceful and succinct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCBS has acknowledged editing Harris answer.\n\nTrump and fellow conservatives seized on the edits, claiming CBS had manipulated Harris answer to make her appear more authoritative to enhance her standing with voters. He called the edits an example of election interference.\n\nTrump and fellow conservatives seized on CBS edits to Harris answer, calling them an example of election interference. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)\n\nCBS has long denied such claims.\n\nParamount Co-Chief Executive George Cheeks said during the companys shareholder meeting Wednesday that settlements are designed for companies to avoid being mired in uncertainty and distraction.\n\nCompanies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause, Cheeks said.\n\nThat rationale did little to mollify detractors who alleged that Trumps complaints were thin.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris talks to 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker. (CBS News)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParamounts settlement will be remembered as one of the most shameful capitulations by the press to a president in history, said Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation.\n\nParamount said the agreement with Trump included a release from threatened defamation claims.\n\nBut its not clear that Paramounts headaches will go away.\n\nThree left-leaning U.S. Senators  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) want to take a closer look at Paramounts decision-making.\n\nIn May, the senators sent a strongly worded letter to Paramounts controlling shareholder, Redstone. They cautioned that a settlement could be viewed as bribing an elected official to win favorable regulatory treatment with regard to the Skydance merger.\n\nThis could be bribery in plain sight, Warren said in a statement Wednesday. Im calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.\n\nWhen Democrats retake power, Ill be first in line calling for federal charges, Wyden separately wrote in a post on the Bluesky social media site. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome journalists said they feared the settlement could have a chilling effect, particularly among news organizations that lack deep pockets or have unrelated business pending before the federal government.\n\nCBS News may weather the financial hit, but smaller newsrooms facing similar legal threats could be pushed to the brink, Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at the nonprofit PEN America, said in a statement.\n\nThe danger is clear, Richardson said, calling the settlement a spineless capitulation.\n\nEmboldened politicians and powerful actors will feel more free than ever to weaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism."

[The] defendants rescinding of these awards is shameful. It is likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence. No federal agency, especially the Department of Justice, should conduct itself in such [a] manner, Mehta wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on 21 May in the district court for the District of Columbia by five non-profits thatd lost millions of dollars in grant funding through the justice departments largest grant maker, the office of justice programs (OJP) the month prior. On 22 April they were among hundreds of organizations to receive notices from the justice department telling them that their grants were terminated because they no longer aligned with the agencys priorities.\n\nInstead, the department intends to focus on more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault, and better coordinating law enforcement efforts at all levels of government, the notice read.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the cuts were done arbitrarily and went beyond the DOJs authority.\n\nThe sudden and unlawful termination of these public safety grants makes neighborhoods everywhere less safe and does irreparable harm to communities across the country, Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which filed the suit , said in a press release announcing the complaints filing.\n\nThe organizations represented in the suit are: the Vera Institute of Justices center on youth justice, Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action, Stop AAPI Hate, Force Detroit and Health Resources in Action.\n\nIn response, the justice department argued that the case is an example of a classic contractual dispute and should have been filed in the court of federal claims. Outside of the courtroom, they also said that grants were cut because they failed to effectuate and further the Trump administrations crime fighting approach.\n\n\n\nThis lawsuit is one of several filed against the Trump administration funding cuts for research and community-based services."

        "content": "Black colleges and universities reach out to students left stranded by Job Corps cuts\n\nAs federally funded Job Corps centers are forced to close because of budget cuts, some Historically Black Colleges are helping the displaced students.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nAt least 90 federally funded Job Corps centers run by contractors across the country are closing. That is, unless a lawsuit against the Trump administration goes their way. As Maggie Ryan with Little Rock Public Radio reports, some historically Black colleges are finding ways to help students impacted by the closures.\n\nMAGGIE RYAN, BYLINE: Samantha Reyes enrolled in Job Corps because she didn't have any other option. She was interested in going to college but couldn't afford it. She heard about Job Corps and joined a program in Little Rock, Arkansas, last August.\n\nSAMANTHA REYES: I feel like it was definitely meant for me. It was a blessing in that I could just go and pick up a trade, whatever that looked like.\n\nRYAN: Reyes decided to become a certified nursing assistant. Like Reyes, most Job Corps students are between the ages of 16 and 24. They take classes to earn their high school diploma, driver's license or learn skills to prepare for a range of careers. Job Corps also provides free housing, meals and health insurance. The whole program is free, meant for low-income people without other options. For many students, it's the only thing that keeps them from being homeless. But in late May, the center director called a meeting for the 120 Job Corps students. Reyes said he told them to hurry up with their programs as the center would be shutting down.\n\nREYES: Now, everybody who's here for your high school, here for your driver's license, here for your trade, like, whatever you're here for, you need to get it now, by the end of this year.\n\nRYAN: The news shocked Reyes and her classmates who have to finish by the end of the year. Then they learned they had even less time to leave the center.\n\nREYES: And then, like, a few hours later, he sat us all down one more time, and he said, I'm sorry, it's shutting down this week.\n\nRYAN: The Department of Labor says the centers run by contractors weren't achieving the intended goals and cost too much per student. Reyes said the next few days were chaotic. Suddenly, all the students had to find a new place to live. She says that she was lucky. She has a high school degree and was able to enroll in summer classes at Shorter College, a nearby, historically Black college. She, along with 19 other Job Corps students, were eligible for free tuition with the help of state and federal scholarships. Shorter College President Jeffery Norfleet says he wanted to help the displaced students find stability.\n\nJEFFERY NORFLEET: Then along with becoming a student here at Shorter, room and board is an option.\n\nRYAN: But it needs to be paid for. So Norfleet asked for help from the community for things like bedding, hygiene products and clothes for the new students.\n\nNORFLEET: And so therefore, these individuals would have a place to lay their heads. They would receive at least three meals a day, possibly snacks and more.\n\nRYAN: Norfleet says he also has buy-in from the greater college community to help out.\n\nNORFLEET: The staff, the faculty, the administration are willing to make this a success because we do believe in the future for these individuals.\n\nRYAN: In Georgia, another HBCU is also trying to bridge the gap for Job Corps students. Morris Brown College in Atlanta is inviting former Job Corps students to apply to their program for the fall. Morris Brown President Kevin James says he's seeing a worrying trend in program cuts across the country.\n\nKEVIN JAMES: Some of the changes that have been made have affected negatively Black and brown students directly. Job Corps is just one example that many students of color will negatively be impacted.\n\nRYAN: He says the news is personal to him. His first job out of college was teaching at a Job Corps center. James says he understands these students are going through a traumatic shift, which means they'll need a wide range of support.\n\nJAMES: So we're not just going to throw you in the deep end of the pool. We're going to make sure that you have all the resources that you need to be successful.\n\nRYAN: Meanwhile, Samantha Reyes says she's grateful to have found a place at Shorter to continue her education. But she's still processing the sting of having her life plans change in a moment. And she's worried about the rest of her Job Corps cohort, those who didn't or couldn't enroll at Shorter.\n\nREYES: I'm living out the best possible outcome of this shutdown, but there's a lot of people who don't get to say that.\n\nRYAN: The government still operates 24 Job Corps centers directly through the National Forest Service, but the future of those run by contractors is pending litigation.

        "content": "LIUYANG, China  There are few sights more dazzling than fireworks on the Fourth of July. Yet all the sparkle and sound on the most American day of the year relies almost solely on China, which is mired in a trade war with the United States that could disrupt fireworks displays across the country from big cities to backyard barbecues.\n\nThe U.S. imported more than 120,000 tons of fireworks in 2023, with over 97% of them  including those displayed at Independence Day celebrations  coming from China, according to the World Bank. American fireworks wholesalers and distributors are warning that President Donald Trumps tariffs on Chinese imports could limit supply and send prices soaring unless the duties are brought down.\n\nThough most Chinese-made fireworks were shipped in time for this years Fourth of July celebrations, uncertainty hangs over future holidays as well as the grand celebration Trump has promised for the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.\n\nWorkers making fireworks at a factory in Liuyang, China. Fred Dufour / NBC News\n\nU.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, which had reached as high as 145%, are currently at 30% after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce that ends in mid-August. The tariff rate for fireworks was previously 5%.\n\nThe uncertainty is felt strongly here in Liuyang, a production hub in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that on its own makes nearly 60% of the worlds fireworks. The city of about 1.5 million people is proudly known as the birthplace of fireworks, with a history in the business dating to Chinas Tang Dynasty more than 1,000 years ago.\n\nWendy Tang, owner of Pyroshine Fireworks in Liuyang, said factories went through a really hard time when U.S.-China trade tensions escalated in March and April, a peak shipping season for July Fourth fireworks. At times, the U.S. and China were increasing their tariff rates multiple times a day.\n\nIn the morning, its 100%. But in the afternoon, its like 200%, Tang said, making it very hard for her American customers to decide whether to proceed with their orders.\n\nWorkers at factories in Liuyang make nearly 60% of the world's fireworks. Fred Dufour / NBC News\n\nHer U.S. clients eventually chose to go ahead, Tang said, and her company cleared almost all of its stock.\n\nMy customers said: OK. No matter what, we need fireworks for the consumers during the Independence Day, said Tang, who said she is now trying to confirm as many orders as possible for next years July Fourth.\n\nWhile most U.S. warehouses were already stocked with fireworks for this year, shows in some places may be scaled back or cost more.\n\nWere looking at $20,000 or more increased cost just to get the container out of port, Matthew Lavigne, the owner of Green Mountain Fireworks in Alburgh, Vermont, told NBC affiliate WPTZ.\n\nWorkers at the factory wear color-coded uniforms from yellow to orange  orange being the most dangerous  to indicate the level of danger linked with their tasks. Fred Dufour / NBC News\n\nIn a letter to Trump sent in April, the American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association said the tariffs could cripple the $2 billion fireworks industry in the U.S.\n\nTariffs will not incentivize U.S. production  they will only increase costs, the letter said.\n\nThough fireworks received a tariff exemption during Trumps first term, there is no word on whether there will be any such reprieve this time around.\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: Real prosperity and patriotism isnt celebrating the independence of our country with cheap foreign-made firecrackers and trinkets  its having a country with booming Main Streets, a thriving working class, and robust manufacturing.\n\nThe fireworks industry says it would be impossible for the U.S. to replicate Chinese manufacturing, citing its lack of key raw materials, its high labor costs and the extensive land it requires.\n\nTheres no country on the planet that can have this infrastructure and can do mass production that they can do here, Nicols Souza Linares, international business manager at the Indiana-based North Central Industries, the largest supplier of fireworks in the U.S. Midwest, said in an interview in Liuyang.\n\nAt Tangs factory, there are dozens of workshops scattered across the slopes, serving different purposes in the production process.\n\nSome steps are automated, such as cutting paper and rolling it into shells or stacking tubes to form casings, but others, such as loading powder into the tubes, have to be done by hand because the work is so delicate and risky.\n\nAn explosion at a Hunan fireworks factory this month killed nine people and injured 26 others, according to Xinhua, Chinas state-run news agency.\n\nTo prevent such accidents, work areas are separated by walls and kept at a distance from each other, with high-risk stages monitored by surveillance cameras overseen by local authorities. The government has strict rules limiting the amount of explosive powder each person can handle and the number of workers allowed in each area at any given time.\n\nWorkers wear color-coded uniforms from yellow to orange  orange being the most dangerous  to indicate the level of danger linked with their tasks. Those working with the most dangerous materials are required to stop by around noon, before the hottest time of day.\n\nThe American fireworks industry, which is made up mostly of small businesses, relies heavily on factories such as Tangs to supply events big and small.\n\nBut Pyroshine Fireworks has received very few orders recently as U.S. distributors wait and see whats going to happen with the tariffs, said Melissa Cai, the companys U.S. sales manager.\n\nIf the U.S. and China cant reach a trade agreement, there will be a big disruption in the fireworks market, Souza said.\n\nWe are really nervous because nobody knows whats going to happen, he said.\n\nJanis Mackey Frayer, Dawn Liu and Rae Wang reported from Liuyang and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

        "content": "National Guard wait for their lunch with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles on June 12.\n\nBuilding the border wall. Increasing detention capacity. Hiring thousands of immigration agents.\n\nThe budget bill narrowly approved by the Senate on Tuesday includes massive funding infusions  roughly $150 billion  toward immigration and border enforcement. If passed, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cement President Trumps hard-line legacy on immigration.\n\nThe budget bill would make Immigration and Customs Enforcement the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government, exceeding its current yearly $3.4-billion detention budget many times over. It also would impose fees on immigration services that were once free or less expensive and make it easier for local law enforcement to work with federal authorities on immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 940-page Senate bill will now head back to the House, which passed its version in May, also by one vote, 215 to 214. The two chambers must now reconcile the two versions of the bill.\n\nThough the legislation is still evolving, the immigration provisions in the House and Senate versions are similar and not subject to the intense debates on other issues, such as Medicaid or taxes.\n\nMany of the funds would be available for four years, though some have longer or shorter timelines. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that, if enacted, the bill would increase the deficit by at least $3.3 trillion\n\nover the next 10 years.\n\nHere are key elements concerning immigration:\n\nBorder wall\n\n$46.5 billion toward fortifying the U.S.-Mexico border wall and interdicting migrant smugglers at sea.\n\nThis includes building barrier sections and access roads and installing barrier-related technology such as cameras, lights and sensors. The legislation doesnt reference specific locations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, in his first term, repeatedly vowed that Mexico would pay for the wall. It didnt.\n\nStaffing\n\n$32 billion for immigration enforcement, including staffing of ICE and expanding so-called 287(g) agreements, in which state and local law enforcement agencies partner with federal authorities to deport immigrants.\n\n$7 billion for hiring Border Patrol agents, customs officers at ports of entry, air and marine agents and field support staff; retention bonuses; and vehicles.\n\n$3.3 billion to hire immigration judges and support staff, among other provisions.\n\nTrump has said he wants to hire 10,000 ICE agents, as well as 3,000 Border Patrol agents.\n\nDetention\n\n$45 billion to build and operate immigrant detention facilities and to transport those being deported.\n\n$5 billion for new Customs and Border Protection facilities and improvements to existing facilities and checkpoints. Its unclear how this could affect California or the Border Patrol checkpoint on Interstate 5 near San Onofre.\n\nThe bill allows for families to be detained indefinitely, pending a removal decision.\n\n. Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, called that a blatant violation of the so-called Flores settlement agreement, which has been in place since 1977 and limits to 20 days the duration children can legally be detained.\n\nLocal assistance\n\n$13.5 billion to reimburse states and local governments for immigration-related costs. These are divided into two pots of funding: $10 billion for the state border security reinforcement fund and the Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide or BIDEN fund. Both would fund the arrest by local law enforcement of immigrants who unlawfully entered the U.S. and committed any crime.\n\nYou can think of it like a gift for [Texas Gov. Greg] Abbott, Altman said.\n\nImmigration fees\n\nA fee of at least $100 for those seeking asylum, down from a $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. Applicants also would pay $100 every year the application remains pending. This is unprecedented  a fee has never before been imposed on migrants fleeing persecution.\n\nAt least $550 ($275 on renewal) to apply for employment authorization for those with asylum applications, humanitarian parole and temporary protected status. Currently there is no fee for asylum seekers and a $470 fee for others.\n\nAt least $500 for temporary protected status, up from $50.\n\nThe stated fees are minimums  the bill allows for annual increases and, for many, prohibits waivers based on financial need.\n\nThe paradox of a fee for an employment authorization document is that youre not allowed to work, but you need to pay for the fee, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAltman noted that imposing a yearly fee on asylum seekers for their pending applications punishes people for the U.S. governments backlogged system, which is out of the applicants control.\n\nOther sections exclude lawfully present immigrants, such as refugees and those granted asylum, from benefits including Medicare, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Another provision excludes children from the child tax credit if their parent lacks a Social Security number.\n\nPraise and scorn\n\nAltman, whose organization has closely tracked the immigration aspects of the funding bill, said people can look at the legislation two ways: big picture  as a $150-billion infusion to supercharge what the Trump administration has already started  or surgically, as a series of policy changes that will not be easy to undo and make an already corrupt system subject to even fewer safeguards and really go after peoples most basic needs.\n\nBush-Joseph had a different view. She said the funding reinforces an outdated and inflexible immigration system without fundamentally changing it.\n\nThats why theres all this money going to the border even though there arent a lot of people coming now, she said.\n\nMoney alone wont change things overnight, Bush-Joseph said. It takes time to hire people and to open detention facilities. Immigration judges will still have a massive backlog of cases. And getting foreign countries to agree to accept more deportees is tricky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArresting and detaining people with private contractors doesnt get you to an agreement from El Salvador to take five more planes per week, she said.\n\nDuring a White House event Thursday, Trump urged Congress to pass the bill quickly, saying it will be the single most important piece of border legislation to ever come across the floor of Congress.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against the bill Tuesday, had called it reckless spending, writing on X: Im all for hiring new people to help secure our borders, but we dont need it to the extent thats in this bill, especially when our border is largely contained.\n\nAcross the political aisle, Democrats including California Sen. Alex Padilla have slammed the bill, saying the immigration-related funding increases amount to a substantial policy change.\n\nYou would think that maybe just for a moment, Republicans would take this reconciliation process as an opportunity to do what they said before they wanted to do and modernize our nations immigration system, Padilla said last month. But theyre not."

        "content": "Lauren Snchez and Jeff Bezos have a few unusual wedding-planning issues to worry about as their celebration looms in Venice  issues like a threatened blockade of the citys canals.\n\nBe glad youre not Jeff Bezos or Lauren Snchez. Sure, being that rich would be awesome, but being rich comes with rich-people problems. With their Italian wedding imminent, they have a host of things to worry about that would never cross the imaginations of other, more average couples who dont have 12 digits representing their net worth.\n\nMost details of the Venice fte are being kept close to the vest. A couple of local companies have confirmed they are contributing handcrafted glassware and local pastries to the wedding-favor goodie bags. Some guests names leaked when the invites went out in March (we name-drop below, never fear).\n\nBut a few details that might be quite vexing to the bride and groom are playing out in public. Lets take a look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour destination weddings destination might hate you\n\nAll of Venice may not truly be ticked off, but photos, activists and media coverage make it seem that way.\n\nVenice teacher and activist Marta Sottoriva called the wedding the symbol of all that is wrong with Venice.\n\nTheres a lot of anger in the air because once again the council has enslaved itself to the logic of profit  our city has been sold to the highest bidder, she told the Guardian. Every time an event of this kind happens, the city comes to a standstill, certain areas become inaccessible and even more tourists arrive. (Venice has been really annoyed lately by its number of tourists, kind of like the Louvre is really annoyed.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo Space for Bezos activists speak at a public meeting of residents on June 13 in Venice, Italy. (Andrea Merola / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nBut tourism councilor Simone Venturini was shocked that anyone might be upset that such a high-profile event was happening in the city.\n\nWe should all be proud that the Bezos wedding, an event of international importance, is being held in the waters of our lagoon, he told the Guardian. Instead, the usual protest professionals have wasted no time. We want to reiterate that Venice is open to everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVenturini was more colorful in speaking to the Wall Street Journal, saying, If Bezos wedding goes ahead as planned, without these pain-in-the-ass protests, Venetian citizens wont even notice.\n\nThe couples London-based wedding planners, Lanza & Baucina, told CNN in a statement, Rumors of taking over the city are entirely false and diametrically opposed to our goals and to reality. They and the client, the planners said, wanted to minimize any disruption to the city.\n\nThat said, its impossible to get a reservation this week at the Aman Venice, the nearly 500-year-old hotel on the Grand Canal where the happy couple are rumored to be staying, at least for part of their wedding week, along with a host of wedding guests. The place is fully booked through Sunday, per TMZ, at a reported $2,000 to $10,000 a night per room.\n\nProtests could really screw things up\n\nForget throwing soup on the Mona Lisa  the Bezos wedding protesters might do something truly offensive: They are threatening to screw up traffic on the big day.\n\nBezos will never get to the Misericordia [event space], activist Federica Toninello told an appreciative crowd last week, according to CNN. We will block the canals, line the streets with our bodies, block the canals with inflatables, dinghies, boats.\n\nHaving just learned what the Misericordia is, we have no idea what role the location might play in the nuptials, but it looks like a nice enough spot for a reception. Fondazione Giorgio Cini, a cultural center built in 1951, has also been floated as a wedding venue. But lets get back to the blockades and such.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother speaker at that same rally said she didnt want Venice remembered as a beautiful wedding venue but as the city that did not bend to oligarchs.\n\nWe cant miss a chance to disrupt a $10-million wedding, Na Haby Stella Faye said  because, really, how often does that chance come around? Although her goal stated at the rally was to stop this wedding, in her Instagram stories Monday, she was promoting a planned Saturday protest of Bezos, President Trump and, well, war.\n\nA massive banner targeting Jeff Bezos, the worlds second-richest man, is laid out in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy, ahead of his wedding to Lauren Snchez. (Greenpeace / Associated Press)\n\nLess aggressive protests include a host of banners and No Space for Bezos posters that have been hung around the city. A colossal message from Greenpeace to Bezos was laid out Monday in the Piazza San Marco. The square banner, which read IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX, was quickly folded up and carried away by local cops, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIts absurd to treat this city like its Disneyland, said Grazia Satta, a retired teacher and social worker, per the Wall Street Journal. The message this wedding sends is that rich people can do whatever they want. We shouldnt kneel before wealth like this.\n\nBy Monday, Bezos security team was making last-minute changes to try to outsmart the activists, according to TMZ. Even the water-taxi companies are being kept in the dark, the site said, and if the water taxis dont know whats going on, who really does?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps Bezos could tap that $212-billion bank account and enlist a Prime Delivery person to drop off himself and his bride discreetly at their reception? Though the human-size Amazon box could be a dead giveaway.\n\nWhose yacht is biggest  and where will they park?\n\nYes, we know yachts dont park, they drop anchor. But no matter what you call it, the biggest yachts cant drop anchor in all parts of Venice.\n\nOne wedding theory has held that Bezos and Snchez will exchange their vows on his 417-foot yacht, the Koru, where he proposed to her two years ago after five years of dating. But reported plans to dock the yacht in a lagoon might have changed. Apparently the close-to-shore concept is starting to look like a safety hazard due to those threatened protests of the second-richest man in the world.\n\nThe Koru is far from the only big boat floating around town, mind you. Venice has nine yacht ports, all of which have been booked for the wedding week. Apparently, TMZ reported, noncelebrity billionaire yacht owners are altering their Venice vacation plans to avoid the crush. That has to sting.\n\nFortunately, although the yacht situation is fluid and the airspace over Venice is closed, CNN reported that private helicopters are being given a pass, in case a head of state decides to chopper in. As one does.\n\nOne type of watercraft not involved in the festivities? Gondolas, or at least those piloted by people the WSJ talked to. We are too slow, one gondolier lamented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternational events might affect the guest list\n\nPresident Trump reportedly scored an invitation to the wedding. Unclear if a plus-one for Melania was included. However, the commander in chief is a wee bit busy handling world events these days  hard to tell if he will be able to get away, even for a gala event like this one. Arent destination weddings the worst? So inconvenient.\n\nThat said, Ivanka Trump and hubby Jared Kushner reportedly got invited too, along with Jareds brother Joshua Kushner and model wife Karlie Kloss. So the first family might be represented after all. And who knows, POTUS could swing by. Does Marine One count as a private helicopter?\n\nOthers on the guest list, per TMZ, include Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Bill Gates, singer Jewel, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Corey Gamble, Barbra Streisand, Eva Longoria, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Brian Grazer, Barry Diller, Diane von Furstenberg, models Brooks Nader and Camila Morrone, and Queen Rania of Jordan. Perry wont attend, though, because shes on tour."

        "content": "King Charles III's monarchy will not get a pay raise this year, but the Sovereign Grant will go up by more than 45 million pounds or around $60 million in the 2026-2027 year, accounts showed.\n\nAs many of his fellow Britons cope with a cost-of-living crisis, the grant which is paid for by the public and used for royal spending and upkeep of royal assets, remained at around 86 million pounds ($110 million) for the 2024-2025 year, latest annual figures from the Crown Estate showed. The grant will rise to around $170 million next year and remain stable for 2026-2027.\n\nThe increase of more than 53% came as the monarchy reported record offshore wind farm profits to the Crown Estate, which is a vast royal collection of land and property across the United Kingdom. This will be used primarily to fund the ongoing refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, according to a Sovereign Grant report released Tuesday.\n\nFunded by the taxpayer, the Sovereign Grant is used to support the official duties of the monarch and other costs such as official travel, thousands of engagements, staff for working royals and the maintenance of occupied palaces.\n\nIt is based on a proportion of profits from the Crown Estate, an independently managed portfolio of assets, including luxury properties in central London, historical estates, rural land and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland worth around 15 billion pounds ($20.6 billion).\n\nThe assets are hereditary possessions held in right of the Crown, the profits of which are added to Britains Treasury. The grant is reviewed every five years, and is expected to next be reviewed through legislation in 2026-27 to keep funding for the royal family at an appropriate level.\n\nControl of the estate was surrendered in 1760 by King George III in exchange for a percentage of the profits.\n\nIn addition, the king receives income via the Privy Purse from the Duchy of Lancaster, a landed estate, while William, the Prince of Wales, receives the net profits from the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nSeparately, the royal family also received additional income of 21.5 million pounds ($29 million) from a record year of visitors to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe monarchys gross share has soared since the Crown Estate clocked in a net revenue profit of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) in 2024-25, which included exceptional short-term uplift from Offshore Wind Leasing, Dan Labbad, its chief executive, said in a separate report released Tuesday.\n\nPart of the Sovereign Grant is being used to fund Buckingham Palaces 10-year, 369 million pounds ($475 million) reservicing, which includes modernizing building services, new lifts and mechanical pipework. The monarchy has already spent 266.5 million pounds ($367 million) of the agreed servicing amount, the grant said.\n\nThe expenses also included more than 800 royal events with almost 100,000 guests, 539 full-time staff.\n\nIn February, Charles took delivery of two new helicopters to replace the existing 15-year-old helicopters due to their unique capability to access remote regions of the U.K. that are not otherwise readily served, the report said.\n\nIt added that the royal train, a favorite of Charles mother Queen Elizabeth II, will be decommissioned following a thorough review into its use and value for money.\n\nNews of the royal family's soaring budget was met with criticism in some quarters of the U.K. where 4.5 million children, or around a third of the total population of kids, live in poverty, an increase of 100,000 from the previous year, according to government statistics published in March.\n\nAn estimated 62% people said their cost of living increased in May compared to April, according to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey conducted by the U.K.s Office for National Statistics. The survey reported that 92% of all people also said food shopping became more expensive in the same period.\n\nHalf a billion could go a long way to relieving some of that poverty, Graham Smith, the chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group, Republic told NBC News in a telephone interview Tuesday.\n\nThat money is instead being spent on their personal lifestyles, helicopters and two dozen palatial homes. Its just criminal, he added."

Derrick Van Orden, a Republican from Wisconsin, told reporters, using an expletive to suggest Trump was treating lawmakers like his minions. Im a member of Congress. I represent almost 800,000 Wisconsinites. Is that clear?\n\nFrustration within the Republican Party was coming from two disparate camps of a broad-tent coalition that have their own sets of grievances: fiscal hawks who believe the bill adds too much to the national debt, and lawmakers representing districts that heavily rely on Medicaid.\n\nOne GOP lawmaker who attended the White House meeting Wednesday, Rep. David Valadao of California, represents a Central Valley district with one of the highest percentages of Medicaid enrollment in the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe presidents megabill, which he calls the Big Beautiful Bill, levies historic cuts to the healthcare program that could result in up to 12 million Americans losing health coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, gutting $1 trillion in funding and introducing a work requirement for enrollees of 80 hours per month until they turn 65 years old.\n\nThe legislation would also restrict state taxes on healthcare providers, known as the provider tax, an essential tool for many states in their efforts to supplement Medicaid funding. Several Republican lawmakers fear that provision could have devastating effects on rural hospitals.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, appearing Wednesday with other Democrats on the Capitol steps, denounces President Trumps tax and spending bill. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA handful of Republican lawmakers from North Carolina have bristled at the presidents pressure campaign, with Rep. Chuck Edwards telling Punchbowl News that the White House meeting didnt sway my opinion. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis was one of three Republicans who voted against the bill Tuesday, warning it would devastate his state. It still passed with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance.\n\nThe vote was shaping up to be narrow in the House as well, where Johnson can afford to lose only three votes in order to pass the omnibus legislation.\n\nA daylong debate on the House floor allowed for private negotiations to continue, ahead of a crucial procedural vote on rules that would be the last step before a final vote. But it was unclear whether the expressions of frustration and doubt Wednesday amounted to performance art in anticipation of the bills inevitable passage, or signaled a genuine threat to the bill.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, after taking meetings at the White House, members of the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc founded to promote fiscal responsibility, also met with Johnson. The speaker emerged with a message of tempered optimism and later said he was hoping to secure a final vote Wednesday night.\n\nI feel very positive about the progress, weve had lots of great conversations, Johnson told reporters, but we cant make everyone 100% happy. Its impossible.\n\nThis is a deliberative body. Its a legislative process by definition  all of us have to give up on personal preferences, he said. Im never going to ask anyone to compromise core principles, but preferences must be yielded for the greater good. And thats what I think people are recognizing and coming to grips with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the Freedom Caucus, had been highly critical of the Senate legislation. But he signaled an openness Wednesday afternoon to vote in favor of the bill, an indication that passage could be imminent.\n\nDemocrats are out of power across Washington and have no ability to stop the legislation. But many believe it could backfire on Republicans in the midterm elections next year.\n\nEvery single Senate Republican is going to have to answer for these cruel and unpopular cuts this election, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said after the bill passed the Senate. This is putting their majority at serious risk.\n\nTrump says the legislation encompasses his entire domestic agenda, extending tax cuts passed during his first term in 2017 and beefing up funding for border security, mass deportations and the Defense Department.\n\nCuts to Medicaid, as well as to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, are intended to offset a fraction of the costs. But the CBO still estimates the legislation will add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and hundreds of billions to the deficit, with other nonprofit budget trackers forecasting even higher figures."

        "content": "Sen. Alex Padilla speaks during a news conference Thursday at the Federal Building on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.\n\nA day after federal agents forcibly restrained and handcuffed U.S. Sen Alex Padilla at a Los Angeles news conference, leaders of the countrys two political parties responded in what has become a predictable fashion  with diametrically opposed takes on the incident.\n\nPadillas fellow Democrats called for an investigation and perhaps even the resignation of the senators nemesis, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, for what they described as the unprecedented manhandling of a U.S. senator who was merely attempting to ask a question of a fellow public official.\n\nNoem and fellow Republicans continued to depict Padilla as a grandstander, whose unexpected appearance at Noems news conference seemed to her security detail to represent a threat, as she tried to speak to reporters at the Federal Building in Westwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans continued Friday to chastise Padilla, using words like launch, lunge and bum rush to describe Padillas behavior as he began to try to pose a question to Noem at Thursdays news conference.\n\nThe Trump administration official was just a few minutes into her meeting with reporters when Padilla moved assertively from the side of the room, pushing past a Times photographer as he moved to more directly address Noem. He did not lunge at Noem and was still paces away from her when her security detail grabbed the senator.\n\nVoices Arellano: Sen. Alex Padillas crime? Being Mexican in MAGA America The manhandling of California Sen. Alex Padilla and his subsequent depiction by conservatives as a modern-day Pancho Villa isnt surprising one bit.\n\nPadilla and his staff described how the veteran lawmaker went through security and was escorted by an FBI employee to the room where the press conference was held, saying it was absurd to suggest he presented a threat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPadilla spoke out after the secretary asserted that her homeland security agents had come to L.A. to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome leadership that the governor and the mayor have placed on this country.\n\nThe former South Dakota governor would have some reason to recognize Padilla, since he questioned her during her Senate confirmation hearing. A spokesperson at the Homeland Security Department did not respond to a question of whether Noem recognized Padilla when he arrived at her press conference.\n\nAs has become the norm in the nations political discourse, Republicans and Democrats spoke about the confrontation Friday as if they had observed two entirely separate incidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) said Noem should step down, adding: This is ridiculous. And she continues to lie about this incident. This is wrong.\n\nLujan urged his Republican colleagues to support Democrats in asking for a full investigation.\n\nThis is bad. This is precedent-setting, Lujan told MSNBC. And I certainly hope that the leadership of the Senate, my Republican leaders, my friends, that they just look within. Pray on it. Thats what I told a couple of them last night. Pray on this and do the right thing.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus went to Speaker Mike Johnsons office to protest Padillas treatment.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) spoke out on X and on the floor of the Senate. He said the episode fit into a pattern of behavior by the Trump administration. There is simply no justification for this abuse of authority . There can be no justification of seeing a senator forced to their knees.\n\nRep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) went on X to repeat the call for an investigation and to say that Republican leadership is complicit in enabling the growing authoritarianism in this country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking publicly only one Republican lawmaker sounded a note of distress about the episode.\n\nIve seen that one clip. Its horrible, said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). It is shocking at every level. Its not the America I know.\n\nBut most Republicans remained silent, or accused Padilla of being a provocateur.\n\nI think the senators actions, my view is, it was wildly inappropriate, said Johnson, the House speaker. You dont charge a sitting Cabinet secretary.\n\nJohnson added that it was Padilla, who should face some sanction. At a minimum  [it] rises to the level of a censure.  I think there needs to be a message sent by the body as a whole that that is not what we are going to do, thats not how were going to act.\n\nRep. Tom McClintock, (R-Elk Grove) zinged Padilla on X, with some helpful tips. 1. Dont disrupt other peoples press conferences. Hold your own instead. 2. Dont bum-rush a podium with no visible identification. ... 3. Dont resist or assault the Secret Service. It wont end well.\n\nRep. Jay Obernolte (R-Big Bear Lake) also sought to reinforce the notion that agents protecting Noem sensed a real threat, having no way of knowing that Padilla was who he said he was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe congressman said on Fox Business that Padilla had obtained the outcome that they wanted. Now they have a talking point.\n\nNone of the officials in the room, several of whom know Padilla, intervened to prevent the action by the agents, who eventually pushed the senator, face down, onto the ground, before handcuffing him.\n\nNoem did not back off her earlier statement that Padilla had burst into the room.\n\nSenator Padilla chose disrespectful political theatre and interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem, Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant Homeland Security secretary, said in a statement Friday.\n\nMcLaughlin also said that Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers repeated commands, though video made public by Friday did not show such warnings, in advance of Padillas first statement.\n\nThe senators staff members said he privately had received messages of concern from several Republican colleagues, including Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.)\n\nPadilla told Tommy Vietor of the Pod Save America podcast that Trumps aggressive immigration crackdown is an attempt to distract from many other failures  continued instability with the economy, a lack of peace in Ukraine and Gaza and a federal budget plan that is proving unpopular with many Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe always finds a distraction, Padilla said, and, when all else fails, he goes back to demonizing and scapegoating immigrants.  He creates a crisis to get us all talking about something else.\n\nPadilla said repeatedly that Americans should be concerned about how everyday citizens will be treated, if forces working for the Trump administration are allowed to tackle a U.S. senator asking questions in a public building.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, he sent a mass email urging his constituents to sign up for the protests planned for Saturday, to counter the military parade Trump is holding in Washington. PLEASE show up and speak out against what is happening, Padilla wrote. We cannot allow the Trump administration to intimidate us into silence."

        "content": "The list of actors who have won three Oscars is vanishingly short. Walter Brennan (a character actor from Hollywoods Golden Age), Jack Nicholson, and Daniel Day-Lewis are the only men to do it, with Meryl Streep, Katherine Hepburn (who won four), and Ingrid Bergman the only women. Awards season can be fickle, sometimes memorializing films and performances that dont linger in the public eye, but multiple wins are rare enough that they usually cement an actors iconic status in the industry. This years Oscars are a mostly decided affair, with La La Land expected to sweep the major categories, but theres one top award that still seems up in the air: Best Actor, for which Denzel Washington is nominated.\n\nFor months, the obvious frontrunner for the Best Actor trophy was Casey Affleck, whose work in Manchester by the Sea drew raves and a slew of critics awards. Washington, the director and star of August Wilson adaptation Fences, looked to be overshadowed by his co-star Viola Davis (still tipped to win for Best Supporting Actress). But the momentum shifted after Washington won the Screen Actors Guild Award to make it more of a toss-up. With every Oscar race comes a narrative, and for Denzel its a simple onewinning a third trophy would be an acknowledgment not just of his skill as an actor, but of the ubiquity of his stardom, which has lasted longer, and gone in more fascinating directions, than almost any of his peers.\n\nProof of that stardom is the simple fact that Washington made Fences, a project that has long been ignored by Hollywood because its author, August Wilson, had always insisted on hiring an African American director to adapt his Pulitzer Prize-winning play to film. In 1991, The New York Times reported on Wilsons efforts to convince Paramount Pictures to hire someone like Spike Lee, Gordon Parks, or Charles Burnettlegendary names in the industryand the studios intransigence on the issue, despite the involvement of A-lister Eddie Murphy.\n\nIn the intervening 25 years, the script bounced around the industry and was reworked by Wilson before his death in 2005. In 2009, the producer Scott Rudin offered it to Washington, who agreed but wanted to mount it as a Broadway revival first. Even after the plays short Broadway run in 2010, it took years for Washington (who had directed two other films, Antwone Fisher and The Great Debaters) to make the movie, and what he produced feels reverent and intimate. Fences is a hallowed piece of playwriting, and the film radiates respect for Wilsons words, stripping away almost everything (from elaborate sets to camera movements) to live in its long, winding monologues and shocking, dense bursts of exposition and plot.\n\nFences at times feels like a showcasea preservation of Wilsons most famous work that is truest to his vision, rather than its directors. But its also a showcase for Washington as an actor, a chance for him to channel his incredible charisma into a part that slyly comments on it. Troy Maxson, the protagonist of Fences, is a charming motormouth who spends much of the film holding court on various topics, some trivial, others not. His magnetism belies his malevolence. Troy is a seemingly settled, stable family man, but he boils with resentment, real and imagined, over the errant path of his life and the athletic achievements of his son, who he fears will eclipse his own past as a baseball prospect.\n\nThere arent many actors who could pull off what Washington attempts in Fencesto make a stagey film thats profoundly un-cinematic in a lot of ways and that leans heavily on its performances. Theres little for Washington to hide behind. Itd be so easy for the film to feel inauthentic, like a museum piece in which monologues are delivered direct to camera just for some archival purpose. But Fences feels like a living, breathing work of character, a granular examination of a mans passions and insecurities, and, especially as it races to its conclusion, the story of a woman (Troys wife Rose, played by Davis) who finally begins to acknowledge and push back against her husbands stifling flaws.\n\nFences simply could not have been produced without Washingtons sway, but more importantly, its a film that succeeds (and was nominated for Best Picture and Adapted Screenplay along with its leads) because of Washingtons understanding and care for the material. In recent years, his movie appearances had largely concentrated on action films and thrillers, a genre in which he has always excelledprojects like The Equalizer, The Magnificent Seven, and 2 Guns. Fences was a departure only in that it was the first serious non-genre work he had taken on since Flight in 2012 (which led to his last Oscar nomination).\n\nBut Washington has taken that bifurcated approachbalancing roles in genre movies and weightier films for most of his career, after breaking out on TVs St. Elsewhere and getting his first Oscar nomination for playing the anti-Apartheid activist Steve Biko in 1987s Cry Freedom. He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Glory in 1990, and filmed his first of four collaborations with Spike Lee (Mo Better Blues) the same year. He began working with great directors like Lee, Jonathan Demme (Philadelphia), Mira Nair (Mississippi Masala), and Norman Jewison (The Hurricane) while also churning out blockbuster action films like Crimson Tide, Out of Time, and Man on Fire.\n\nUnlike most of todays biggest actors, who are often propelled to success by a franchise, Washington has never even appeared in a sequel. He has achieved a long-lasting run of sterling box-office success solely on the back of his on-screen presence. Fences, which has earned a terrific $55 million at the box office (more than double its budget) may mark a new stage in his careerone where he uses his clout to adapt less commercial work, such as Wilsons entire 10-play Pittsburgh cycle, which he is working to bring to HBO. That influence is part of what the Academy would be honoring with a third Oscar on Sunday night. If Washington wins, his trophy would be a recognition of his rare, enduring star power."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Over the past decade, as I watched ambitious, embattled, fearful, or just plain weak interlocutors deal with Donald Trump, it became obvious that many of them have reached the same conclusion about how best to manage the capricious President: with suck-upperythe more egregious, the better, and ideally combined with a few strategic rounds of golf that Trump is allowed to win. This has proved to be a much safer choice than actually standing up to him. Just ask Volodymyr Zelensky. Or Angela Merkel. Or Mike Pence. In Trumps first term, Poland proposed to name a new permanent U.S. military installation Fort Trump in his honor. Israel thanked him for recognizing its occupation of the Golan Heights by unveiling a new settlement called Trump Heights. At this point in the Trump era, the path of over-the-top praise has been well-trodden by everyone from Lindsey Graham to the late Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, who, in 2018, nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for pursuing a nuclear-disarmament deal with North Korea that did not, in fact, happen. They know what we all know by now: Trump is a reverse-Machiavelli who prefers the praise of the flatterer, no matter how insincere, to the hard counsel of unpleasant truth.\n\nBut, even in the voluminous catalogue of world leaders who have engaged in ego-wilting acts of Trump sycophantism, this weeks performance by Mark Rutte stands out. Rutte, the secretary-general of NATO and former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, hosted the American President on Tuesday and Wednesday in The Hague for the alliances annual summit. To be fair, this was no easy assignment. Trump, a longtime NATO skeptic, threatened to pull out of the alliance altogether at its 2018 gathering; he began his second term demanding billions more in defense spending from NATO allies. Otherwise, he said at one of his 2024 campaign rallies, the alliances main adversary, Russia, ought to be free to do whatever the hell they want to any country that didnt pay up. In response, Rutte and the allies designed the summit around avoiding a blowup with Trumpagreeing in advance to his demand for a new goal of five per cent of G.D.P. to be spent by members annually on their defense budgets, pre-negotiating the summit communiqu so that it could not be derailed by a last-minute Trump tantrum, and making the formal sessions as short as possible. I would call this the Trump Summit,  Marco Rubio, Trumps dual-hatted Secretary of State and national-security adviser, bragged before the official meeting had even begun.\n\nEven after watching the months of anxious buildup that went into hosting Trump, however, I was not fully prepared for Rutte to launch NATO so robustly into what may become known as its MAGA era. The first sign of where Rutte was headed came from Trump himself, who, before leaving for The Hague, posted on his social-media account a text message from the secretary-general that was so florid in its praise that I might not have believed it was real had NATO officials not confirmed it. Rutte hailed the truly extraordinary and decisive action that Trump had taken against Iran over the weekend, launching air strikes aimed at destroying its nuclear program, something no one else dared to do. He promised another big success awaited Trump at the summit. On Wednesday morning, the secretary-general followed up with a photo op alongside Trump; his language during the press conference was, if anything, even more worshipful. He is a man of strength, but also a man of peace, Rutte enthused, as Trump sat practically beaming next to him. He then announced that Trump was personally responsible for a trillion dollars in extra aggregate defense spending in his first term, before crediting Trump with the big splash at this years summit, the new five-per-cent threshold for defense spending. This would not have happened if you had not been elected, Rutte said. So I want to thank you. Trump beamed some more.\n\nAfter Rutte finished speaking, Rubio turned the discussion back to Iran and the controversy of the daya leaked preliminary U.S. intelligence report that, to Trumps fury, found that the air strikes might have only delayed Irans development of a nuclear weapon by a matter of months. Still, Rubio insisted, This was a complete and total obliteration, adopting Trumps O-word as his own. To a veteran Trump-watcher, this was a sign that the press conference was about to take its inevitable partisan turn; rants about the evils of the fake news and the traitorous deep-state intelligence community were clearly soon to come. Rutte could have sat there and said nothing, the obvious course for a nonpartisan European security official, but instead he interrupted Rubio, just to make it clear how much Trump himself deserved credit. Marco, can I just alert you to one other aspect? Rutte said. So, the great thing is you took out the nuclear capability of Iran. This was crucial. You did it in a way which is extremely impressive, but the signal sent to the rest of the world that this President, when it comes to it, yes, hes a man of peace. But, if necessary, he is willing to use strength, the enormous strength of the American military.\n\nWhen the President started talking again, Rutte listened without interruption as Trump accused CNN, MSNBC, and the Times of being scum for daring to report about the intel assessment. He also sat quietly when Trump mentioned how he had talked on the phone with the very nice Vladimir Putin. I wondered what the NATO members thought of that, at a summit where they were pledging to spend trillions of dollars more on their own defenses over the next decade in the hopes of deterring the very nice man from invading them.\n\nFinally, eighteen minutes into this remarkable display, Rutte offered what will no doubt become his most famous act of strategic self-emasculation. A day earlier, before leaving for the NATO summit, Trump had fumed to the cameras about Iran and Israel not sticking to a ceasefire deal that he announced theyd reached on Monday night. We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they dont know what the fuck theyre doing, he said. During his photo op with Rutte in The Hague, Trump referenced his intervention in what he characterized as a big fight like two kids in a schoolyard. Trump did not repeat his expletive-laden criticism, but for some reason Rutte seized the chance to defend him for his F-bomb anyway. Daddy has to sometimes use strong language, he said, with no further elaboration. The moment was so painful it was almost a relief when Trump started talking again.\n\nOne can only imagine what they thought of Ruttes line in the Kremlin. Trump, of course, loved it. After he returned to Washington on Wednesday evening, the White House put out a music video, with a highlight reel of his trip set to Ushers 2009 track, Hey Daddy (Daddys Home). By Thursday morning, Trump was fund-raising off Ruttes comment, selling red DADDY T-shirts for thirty-five dollars a piece. When Biden was President we were LAUGHED at on the world stage. The whole world WALKED ALL OVER US!, an e-mail read. But thanks to your favorite President (ME!) we are respected once again. Moment ago, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called me DADDY on the world stage. How nice!\n\nThe backlash from many of the Europeans whose security interests Rutte was presumably trying to protect by bowing so low was, unsurprisingly, swift. The former foreign minister of Lithuania, Gabrielius Landsbergis, called Ruttes gushings of weakness and meekness both disgraceful and one of the most shameful episodes in modern history. In a long rebuttal on X, he added, I feel I might speak for a significant part of Europeansits tasteless. The wording appears to have been stolen from the adult entertainment industry. Nathalie Tocci, a foreign-policy specialist and former adviser to top European Union officials, said that Ruttes pathetic flattery and genuflection had made her feel profoundly embarrassed as a European. Perhaps more important, she concluded, it doesnt even work.\n\nThis, it strikes me, is an essential point often overlooked by the suck-uppers. Trumps bottomless need for positive affirmation is such that no one can aspire to permanently satisfy it; he simply does not stay sucked-up-to. Ask Mike Pompeo, whose willingness to praise the boss was so extreme when he was Trumps Secretary of State that one former ambassador called him a heat-seeking missile for Trumps ass. Nonetheless, Pompeo was frozen out of a job when Trump returned to officea MAGA expulsion announced by Trump in a social-media post.\n\nAnother problem with Ruttes strategy is that there is little evidence that sycophancy, no matter how extreme, has produced significant long-term change in Trumps views. European leaders, including Ruttes predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg, have spent years trying oh-so-carefully to dissuade Trump from his positive views of Putin, his criticism of Ukraine, and his desire to impose punitive tariffs on the E.U.with little success. If anything, their collective willingness to abase themselves before Trump has likely persuaded him that they are weak pushovers, the opposite of the strong leaders he so admires.\n\nWhen Trump was relected last year, Malcolm Turnbull, a former Prime Minister of Australia, attempted to debunk the myth that flattery will get you everywhere with Trump. There were two misapprehensions about Trump, he told the Times. The first was he would be different in office than on the campaign trail. The second was the best way to deal with him was to suck up to him.\n\nSo what, besides his own embarrassment, did Rutte actually achieve this week by sucking up to Trump? Trump gets the win and goes home, Ivo Daalder, the U.S. Ambassador to NATO during Barack Obamas Presidency, told me, describing how officials had orchestrated the weeks events. NATO lives for another day. But, Daalder added, the reality is different. For starters, the five-per-cent spending target wont actually kick in for a decade, and even then its actually three and a half per cent of G.D.P. to be spent on the military budget, a threshold that even the U.S. does not currently meet. (The other 1.5 per cent is supposed to go to nonmilitary areas, such as roads, ports, and cyber capabilities, that are, in theory, helpful to defense.) Just as importantly, Daalder noted, the reason NATO members agreed to Trumps demand is not only the Russian military threat (which Trump denies exists) but the realization that they can no longer count on the United States.\n\nDaalders description of the state of affairs in Europe today rings much truer to me than Ruttes: If Trump is really daddy, then what hes actually doing is walking out on the familyand warning them that hell no longer pay their bills. I can understand why everyone is so relieved that he didnt smash up everything at the annual family reunion. But is the divorce really off? As for the secretary-general, he ended the summit by trying to walk back the comment for which it will inevitably be remembered. I didnt call him Daddy,  Rutte insisted to reporters. It was all just a metaphor. "

        "content": "Sometimes, the small details tell a larger story. On February 6th, a couple of weeks after Donald Trump returned to the White House, he met with Republican lawmakers to discuss his tax and spending plans. He was looking to extend the huge pro-business tax cuts that Republicans had pushed through during his first term and to enact a pair of more populist proposals he had campaigned on in 2024: exempting tips and seniors Social Security payments from federal taxes. But, as the budget deficit stood at about 6.4 per cent of G.D.P., a very high figure historically, the President and other G.O.P. leaders were under pressure to find revenue raisers and spending cuts that would offset the cost of the policies.\n\nShortly after the meeting, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters that the Administration wanted to eliminate a notorious tax loophole from which some of the richest financiers in the country had benefitted for decades. The loophole, known as the carried-interest deduction, allowed managers of hedge funds and private-equity funds to classify some of their earnings as investment gains that are taxed at a much lower rate than regular income, thus reducing their over-all tax liabilities. Getting rid of it offered not only the prospective benefit of raising money but also an opportunity to boost Trumps populist credentials.\n\nThe announcement presumably came as a surprise to hedge-fund and private-equity titans, some of whom had contributed heavily to the Presidents campaign. At first glance, they had genuine grounds for concern. Although Trump isnt known for stiffing his mega-rich backers, the carried-interest deduction is such a stain on the tax code that even Bill Ackman, a prominent Trump-supporting hedge-fund billionaire, had previously described it in precisely these terms. Brieflyvery brieflyit seemed conceivable that Trump would do something that previous Administrations from both parties had backed away from: face down the hedge-fund and private-equity lobby.\n\nIt didnt happen, of course. In May, when House Republicans passed their thousand-page One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it contained virtually everything else that Trump had asked fortax cuts, large increases in the defense budget, new pots of funding for ICE and Border Patrolbut no mention of eliminating carried interest. Nor was there any reference to it in an amended version of the bill that the Senate narrowly passed on July 1st, with Vice-President J. D. Vance breaking a tie, and a reconciliation bill that the House voted through two days later. After Trump signed the final legislation on Friday afternoon, the hedge-fund and private-equity managers could return to their July 4th pool parties and fireworks displays secure in the knowledge that yet another Administration had failed to consign this lamentable loophole to history.\n\nIn macroeconomic terms, its true that this failure to act was of no great consequence. According to the Congressional Budget Office, treating carried interest as regular income would generate about thirteen billion dollars in additional revenues over ten years. Compared with the $3.4 trillion in new debt that the C.B.O. estimates the G.O.P. bill will create over the same period, that is a drop in the ocean. But, in political and symbolic terms, the survival of the carried-interest deduction speaks volumes.\n\nEver since Trump came down the escalator at Trump Tower ten years ago, he has portrayed himself as a gilded avenger of the toiling masses. At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last July, Vance famously remarked, Were done, ladies and gentlemen, catering to Wall Streetwell commit to the working man. The results of Novembers election showed that the G.O.P. was, indeed, making progress in working-class areas. But, after Fridays signing ceremony, what is left of Trumps and Vances pledges?\n\nA study from the Yales Budget Lab provides an answer to this question. It found that the Senate billwhich was not far off from the final version of the legislation that passedwould decrease the financial resources of households in the bottom twenty per cent of the income distribution by about seven hundred dollars a year and increase the resources of households in the top 0.1 per cent by more than a hundred thousand dollars annually. As I pointed out a few weeks ago, the bill is a reverse-Robin Hood mechanism.\n\nAn analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent watchdog, provides another way to parse the gap between the Trump-Vance rhetoric and reality. It shows that the costliest element of the legislation by fartotalling $4.6 trillion over ten yearsis the extension of the Presidents first-term tax cuts that were enacted while Paul Ryan was Speaker of the House. Those measures slashed the corporate-tax rate, lopped nearly three points off the top income-tax rate, and bestowed big favors on businesses that pass through their incomes to their owners for tax-filing purposes, such as the Trump Organization. Paying for Trumps latest tax cuts and his pet spending allotmentswhich include an additional hundred and fifty billion dollars for military projects and about seventy-five billion to beef up ICE operations, including building more immigrant-detention centers and hiring more ICE agentsadds another trillion dollars or so to the tab, taking it to roughly $5.5 trillion.\n\nLet it not be said that Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House made no effort to reduce this enormous sum. Having given the hedge-fund and private-equity partners a pass, they focussed relentlessly on the benefits afforded to folks at the other end of the income spectrum. By stripping almost a trillion dollars in funding for Medicaid, the public health-care system that covers more than seventy million low-income American adults and their children, and also slashing subsidies to health-care insurance policies purchased on the Obamacare exchanges, they found more than $1.2 trillion in savings. They also hacked about a hundred and forty billion dollars from nutritional-assistance programs, once known as food stamps, and three hundred and thirty billion from student-loan programs and other commitments to education. To save another five hundred and forty billion dollars or so, they repealed Joe Bidens tax credits for purchases of electric vehicles and business investments in clean-energy systems and green manufacturing, climate action be damned.\n\nThe makeup of the Big Odious Bill reveals it to be an ugly hybrid of timeworn trickle-down economics and authoritarian populism. When Trump talks about the bill, he emphasizes components such as cutting taxes for waiters and other workers who rely on tips, jump-starting the creation of a Golden Dome missile shield, and significantly expanding his already burgeoning anti-immigration police state. The latter prospect is particularly alarming: according to the Brennan Center for Justice, ICE is set to become the biggest federal law-enforcement agency. But, in terms of actual money spent, the feed-the-rich part of the bill looms larger.\n\nOren Cass, the founder of the conservative think tank American Compass, who has defended Trumps protectionist trade policies but has argued that Republicans need to embrace higher taxes on the rich, was on the right track when, according to The Economist, he joked that the bill is zombie Reaganism or zombie Ryanism. If it proves to be the last significant piece of tax-and-spending legislation passed while Trump is President, a possibility that is far from remote, he could go down in historyor at least in fiscal historynot as the disrupter and agent of change that he likes to see himself as but rather as someone who simply extended the agenda of Ronald Reagan, Grover Norquist, and Paul Ryan to its logical conclusion: utter incoherence and irresponsibility.\n\nEven some beneficiaries of the bills provisions, including the sparing of the carried-interest deduction, have criticized the bill on these grounds. Ray Dalio, who founded the big hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, posted on LinkedIn, The debt, which is now about 6x of the money taken in, 100 percent of GDP, and about $230,000 per American family, will rise over ten years to about 7.5x the money taken in, 130 percent of GDP, and $425,000 per family. If steps werent taken to change this trajectory, Dalio added, big, painful disruptions will likely occur."

He should be prosecuted, Greene said in an appearance on Steve Bannons \"War Room\" podcast on Thursday. After we win on November 5, Jack Smith should be prosecuted.\"\n\nSmith's office unveiled a damning filing on Wednesday, making public some of the most extreme allegations and evidence of election interference against the former president. Smith has served as an independent special counsel since 2022, tasked with investigating Trumps election interference scheme and classified documents case, the latter of which was ultimately tossed by Trump-appointed judge Aileen Cannon.\n\nGreenes suggestion that Smiths appointment was illegal was one that Cannon used as justification to toss that case, though judges in other Trump cases, including D.C. Judge Tanya Chutkan, have rejected the argument.\n\nIn the clip, Greene also called for prosecution against U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, who prosecuted participants in the Jan. 6 riots. Greene filed articles of impeachment against Graves last year.\n\nThe comments also suggest a worrying attitude towards prosecutorial independence in a possible second Trump term. The remarks come as Trump plots for a return to the White House, detailing plans to install loyalists in a possible attempt to influence investigations.\n\nTrump reportedly already trialed the practice of weaponizing the Justice Department in his first term as president, directing it to investigate critics and seize reporters phones, and threatening to fire opponents.\n\nBut proposals within Project 2025, and Trumps own remarks, indicate that the candidate would have an unprecedentedly vocal role in the Department of Justices business, filling the agency with staffers who would be more willing than the old-guard officials of his first term to go after political opponents."

        "content": "President Trump exits Air Force One as he arrives Tuesday in Amsterdam ahead of the NATO summit.\n\nAboard Air Force One over the Atlantic on Tuesday, President Trump turned his attention for a brief moment from the ceasefire he had brokered between Israel and Iran to one that has proven far more elusive.\n\nId like to see a deal with Russia, Trump told reporters before arriving in the Netherlands for a NATO summit and referencing his private conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. Vladimir called me up. He said, Can I help you with Iran? I said, No, I dont need help with Iran. I need help with you.\n\nI hope were going to be getting a deal done with Russia, Trump added. Its a shame.\n\nIt was a rare expression of frustration from Trump with Putin at a critical time in Moscows war against Ukraine, and as Ukrainian leaders and their allies in Europe desperately seek assurances from Trump that U.S. assistance for Kyiv will continue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president arrived at the summit on Tuesday evening in The Hague, where he is expected to meet with leaders from across Europe, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nNow were going to NATO  well get a new set of problems, Trump said of the meetings. Well solve a new set of problems.\n\nThe European bloc hopes to leverage Trumps jubilation over the outcome of Israels war with Iran  which saw its nuclear program bombed and much of its military leadership and air defenses eliminated  into a diplomatic success for itself, European officials told The Times. After ordering U.S. precision strikes against three of Irans main nuclear facilities over the weekend to assist the Israeli campaign, Trump announced a ceasefire in the conflict on Monday that has tentatively held.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe message will be that deterrence works, one European official said. The hope, the official added, is that Trump will feel emboldened to take a more aggressive stance toward Russia after succeeding in his strategic gamble in the Middle East.\n\nWhether the U.S. bombing raid worked, however, remains an open question. An initial assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency, which reviewed imagery of the damage at the nuclear sites, concluded that the U.S. attack likely failed to destroy Irans core nuclear capabilities, only setting its program back by a few months, according a report by CNN confirmed to The Times by an official familiar with the matter.\n\nIn The Hague, discussions among NATO and European officials have focused on Russias timetable for reconstituting its land army, with the most aggressive analyses estimating that Moscow could be in a position to launch another full-scale attempt to take over Ukraine  or a NATO member state  by 2027.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a text message sent to Trump, screenshots of which he posted to social media, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte fawned over the presidents decisive action to bomb Iran, a decision he called truly extraordinary.\n\nDonald, you have driven us to a really, really important moment for America and Europe, and the world, Rutte wrote. You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.\n\nRutte was referencing a new commitment by members of the alliance to spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense, a significant increase that has been a priority for Trump since his first term in office.\n\nThe matter is not fully settled, with Spain resisting the new spending commitment. Theres a problem with Spain,  Trump told reporters on the plane, which is very unfair to the rest of the people.\n\nBut the new funding  BIG money, as Rutte put it  could help appease a president who has repeatedly expressed skepticism of the NATO alliance.\n\nAs he spoke with reporters, Trump questioned whether Article 5 of the NATO charter, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, in fact requires the United States to come to the defense of its allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are numerous definitions of Article 5, [but] Im committed to being their friends, he added. Ive become friends with many of those leaders, and Im committed to helping them.\n\nTrump has failed thus far to persuade Putin to agree to a ceasefire against Ukraine despite applying pressure to both sides  particularly against Kyiv, which Trump has incorrectly blamed for starting the war.\n\nIn the Dnipro region of Ukraine on Tuesday, 160 people were injured and 11 were killed in a ballistic missile strike by Moscow, Zelensky wrote on social media.\n\nRussia cannot produce ballistic missiles without components from other countries, Zelensky said. Russia cannot manufacture hundreds of other types of weapons without the parts, equipment and expertise that this deranged regime in Moscow does not possess on its own. That is why it is so important to minimize the schemes that connect Russia with its accomplices. There must also be a significant strengthening of sanctions against Russia.\n\nAssuming a similar strategy to the Europeans, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in an interview on Sunday that Congress should act to enable Trump with leverage against Putin in upcoming negotiations.\n\nHow does this affect Russia? Graham responded on NBCs Meet the Press, when asked about the war with Iran. Ive got 84 co-sponsors for a Russian sanctions bill that is an economic bunker-buster against China, India and Russia for Russias brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think that bills going to pass, he added. Were going to give the president a waiver. It will be a tool in Trumps toolbox to bring Putin to the table."

Nearly six months after the Palisades wildfire scorched 23,000 surrounding acres, decimated thousands of nearby homes, and damaged much of the museum grounds, the Los Angeles landmark is open again.\n\nIt is a moment of joy for staff and visitors, tempered by the continuing recovery outside the museum walls. Alexandria Sivak, an assistant communications director for the Getty, expresses a solemn understanding that we are surrounded by many homes that did not make it through the fire ... while at the same time feeling very grateful that we remain standing.\n\nVisitors to the museums reopening echo that gratitude.\n\nWhy We Wrote This A story focused on Joy The Getty Villa Museum, a cultural touchstone in LA, escaped major damage from wildfires. Its reopening gives recovering Angelenos, and others, something to smile about.\n\nTo come here and experience this shows that theres life and theres beauty and theres still art to experience here, says Phil Sky, who worked on the villa as a carpenter about 20 years ago.\n\nOil magnate J. Paul Getty built the Roman-style villa more than 50 years ago as a monument to classical art and architecture. It houses tens of thousands of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities. The gardens offer beauty and tranquility overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Olive trees, fennel, and purple artichoke thistles grow in an herb garden filled with Mediterranean plants. Around the corner, the outer gardens sitting areas encircle a sparkling reflecting pool outlined with perfectly trimmed hedges, and walled in by frescoed landscapes of the Italian countryside.\n\nSandy Hooper/USA TODAY/Reuters The vegetation around the Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood smolders on Jan. 8, 2025, the day after a wildfire swept through Los Angeles County.\n\nI dont feel like this is LA, says Mr. Sky. Im walking through Europe or some other country as I go through here.\n\nDuring the Palisades fire, artwork was safe inside the buildings, which were designed to withstand heat and flames. But there was stress and nervousness in the operation center as we were watching fires spark up surrounding the campus, says Ms. Sivak. The fire consumed more than 1,400 trees on the property and left soot and ash blanketing the site.\n\nThis is Robyn Kranzlers first visit to the museum, even though she grew up in nearby North Hollywood. Im blown away. I didnt know it was so beautiful here, she says.\n\nThe professional runner lives in Wisconsin now, and hasnt been back in nearly four years. The extent of the area's fire damage is shocking, she says, and the villa provides an important break from the political and social upheaval going on in the world. Its so easy to get caught up in all the here and now. ... And having something like this just kind of reminds you that there is a lot more.\n\nAli Martin/The Christian Science Monitor LA native Robyn Kranzler visits the Getty Villa reopening in Los Angeles, June 27, 2025. Ms. Kranzler has been living in Wisconsin for the last few years, and is visiting the museum for the first time on a trip back home.\n\nLee Holtz lives in New York, but spends a lot of time in Los Angeles. He was here during the January wildfires. In a landscape of impermanence, the museum is remarkable for enduring, he says. This is the survivor of an earlier and in some ways grander civilization. So thats symbolic in all kinds of ways.\n\nThe thought that it might not survive the next disaster got Heather Fuller to drive up from Orange County, south of Los Angeles. She had planned to visit in January, but the fires kept her away.\n\nShes happy the villa is open, she says, and hopes it symbolizes that everyone else who is affected will be able to get back to their lives as well."

The G7 governments caved under intense pressure from President Donald Trump and lobbying from multinationals in Washington, London, Brussels, and beyond  just as India, and now, sadly, Canada have caved on digital taxation.\n\nYears ago, the international community recognised that too many global companies were not paying their fair share of taxes, and some werent paying taxes to the country where the economic activity actually occurs. The complex agreement that emerged in 2021 at the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting comprised two pillars; only Pillar Two, a global minimum corporate tax, has been adopted. (The other pillar allocated taxation rights among countries and spurred opposition from developing countries and the US.)\n\nWhile there has been a global consensus on the need for such a minimum, the version the US adopted during Trumps first presidential term was different, and weaker, than that of the rest of the world, allowing multinationals to make up for what they didnt pay in tax havens with the extra they paid in the US or other high-tax jurisdictions.\n\nWhile far from perfect, Pillar Two was a first attempt to ensure a minimum tax rate of 15% on the profits of multinationals everywhere, a crucial step to end harmful tax competition between countries.\n\nThere were, of course, some carve-outs and exemptions, which lowered the effective rate somewhat below 15%. And the 15% rate was already lower than the rate imposed by many developing countries; it should have been higher, and the carve-outs smaller. Still, the Pillar Two deal halted the race to the bottom, whereby countries offered lower tax rates to attract businesses to their jurisdictions. For the world as a whole, this race didnt generate much new investment; the real winners were the rich corporations who pocketed the savings from paying almost no taxes at all in some countries.\n\nBut once again, G7 governments have decided to put multinationals interests before the interests of developing countries, small and medium-size businesses (which cant avail themselves of the shenanigans that multinationals have found so profitable), and their own citizens  who, as a consequence, will pay higher taxes. By exempting US multinationals from Pillar Two, this deal will allow some to continue to benefit from zero or near-zero taxes on profits they book in low-tax jurisdictions or tax havens such as Puerto Rico and the Cayman Islands. This will make them more competitive than non-US multinationals. Because modern multinational corporations are willing to move their nominal headquarters to wherever they get the most favourable tax treatment (and other goodies), with the real economic activity occurring elsewhere, giving US companies preferential treatment incentivises companies to move their official headquarters to the US. This is another sad example of a race to the bottom.\n\nBy acceding to US demands, the G7 deal risks undermining the worldwide implementation of the minimum tax. It also makes a mockery of the inclusiveness of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework.\n\nThere was a pretence that the new global framework was crafted by more than 140 countries working together. To be sure, many developing countries complained this was an unfair agreement for them and that powerful countries did not listen to their concerns. Now that facade has crumbled. The non-G7 countries, including dozens of emerging markets and developing countries, are now being asked to rubber-stamp a decision imposed on them by just one country.\n\nPillar Two should be strengthened, not gutted. It currently applies only to large multinationals (with a global turnover at or above 750m), and the global minimum tax rate of 15% is set very low. The Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation has always advocated a minimum rate of at least 25%.\n\nAccording to some estimates, Pillar Twos minimum tax would have yielded between $155bn and $192bn (112bn-140bn) annually in additional global corporate income tax revenue. While this is a significant amount, a minimum rate of 25% could generate more than $500bn a year in additional revenue. In a world facing converging crises of inequality, climate change, and underfunded public services, leaving such substantial resources on the table is fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible.\n\nPillar Two represented a starting point  a global floor on corporate taxation that could have curbed the race to the bottom and restored some degree of tax justice. The G7s decision to let US multinationals off the hook weakens even that modest floor and sends the wrong message to the rest of the world.\n\nJust two weeks ago at the UN, there was a global consensus about the need to strengthen international tax cooperation and to implement progressive tax systems, and a large majority of countries voted for and support ongoing negotiations toward a UN framework convention on international tax cooperation. But the US government recently walked away from the UN negotiations, stating that the goals of the proposed UN convention are inconsistent with US priorities and represent an unwelcome overreach.\n\nIn the adoption of the Compromiso de Sevilla, the outcome document of this weeks UN Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4), the US was the only major country that was absent. Allowing the US to bypass the already modest Pillar Two rules not only undermines multilateralism; it also flies in the face of the commitments that have been made, and further deepens the inequity in global tax governance.\n\nThe members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework should reject the deal made at the G7. The US must not be allowed to dictate global policy. It is powerful, but still represents less than 20% of global GDP.\n\nCountries meeting in Seville for FfD4 can either accept the US undermining every effort to ensure multinationals pay their fair share, or redouble efforts to create a new international tax system at the UN that works for all. For the sake of the world economy and people everywhere, they should do the latter.\n\nJoseph E Stiglitz is a Nobel laureate in economics, a university professor at Columbia University and a former chief economist of the World Bank.\n\nJos Antonio Ocampo is professor at Columbia University and former finance minister of Colombia.\n\nJayati Ghosh is professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\n Project Syndicate"

Cooper, however, alleges Fieri's company breached a contract in a complaint filed last week in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\nFieri is not personally a defendant in the lawsuit, but his company, Chicken Guy, as well as the company of his business partner. A representative for Fieri did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe \"King of Flavortown\" told contestants in the show's finale that one of them would earn the key to the franchise with a \"full restaurant build out.\" Fieri also promised other perks, including a first year's salary and startup capital.\n\nCoopers franchise opened in February 2024 and closed roughly a year later.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the two companies behind the chicken brand failed to provide the promised $100,000 salary and failed to cover more than $68,000 worth of expenses related to the franchise.\n\nThe contest winner alleges in the lawsuit that he had to take out a personal loan of $13,500 to cover some of the cost due to Fieri's delay. Cooper's lawsuit requests full payment of the promised salary and reimbursement of the expenses.\n\n\"Guy's Chance of a Lifetime\" originally aired on Food Network in late 2021 and early 2022, with only six episodes. In the finale, Fieri announces Cooper as the first-place winner but promises to waive franchise fees for all the other contestants if they choose to open up a Chicken Guy! location of their own.\n\nFieri told Cooper that he showed \"so much strength\" throughout the competition and promised to open Cooper's franchise in Cooper's hometown of Philadelphia.\n\nCooper was in tears after winning the grand prize.\n\n\"This is crazy right now, I can't even believe it,\" Cooper said. \"But I really came here and fought the hardest fight I could possibly fight. And I'm just happy, I'm grateful, and I'm thankful. And I'm just lost for words.\""

        "content": "The American televangelist hellfire preacher Jimmy Swaggart, who has died aged 90, fell by the wayside not once but twice with sex workers, spectacularly ending his previously successful TV ministry that screened in 140 countries and was reputed to bring in $150m a year in merchandising sales.\n\nOn the first occasion, when he was filmed with a woman at a motel near his church in the suburbs of New Orleans in 1988, he prayed for forgiveness in a tearful TV address. On the second occasion three years later in California when he was caught with a woman in his car, he just told his congregation: The Lord told me its flat out none of your business.\n\nHis plight had not been helped by his previous denunciations of rival Pentecostal preachers, which suddenly smacked of hypocrisy. When Jim Bakker had admitted to an affair with a church secretary, Swaggart described him as a cancer on the body of Christ, one of those pompadoured pretty boys with their hair done and their nails done who call themselves preachers.\n\nHe had also hounded a rival televangelist called Marvin Gorman out of ministry with accusations of adultery. It was Gorman who then proved his nemesis, tracking him to the motel.\n\nSwaggarts style as a preacher was bellowing alternating with whispering, speaking in tongues, bursts of song and bouts of tears. There were anecdotes of miraculous saves  his cars engine came unclogged on one occasion apparently by the application of anointing oil  and there were dreadful warnings too. These were well within the American Pentecostal traditions of what was called the sawdust trail, pioneered in rural circus tents by earlier evangelists such as Billy Sunday. Indeed Swaggart started his ministry preaching on street corners and from a flatbed truck, and living in church basements when he could not afford anywhere more upmarket to stay.\n\nHis denunciations were scattergun and not exactly Christian, though he was of course a Biblical literalist. He denounced Catholics and Jews, Mormons and Muslims with equal venom as cultists and heretics, as well as Darwinists, communists, liberals and judges. He suggested that the Jews had brought the Holocaust on themselves by denying Christ  and of course the End Times were nigh.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jimmy Swaggarts 1972 gospel album At an Altar of Prayer. He had a fine baritone voice and made many bestselling records. Photograph: Alamy\n\nArmageddon is coming, he would proclaim. My Lord, I am happy. I dont care who it bothers. It thrills my soul.\n\nHe came from the tiny rural Louisiana town of Ferriday, part of a tightly knit clan entwined like a big tight ball of rubber bands. His father, Willie Leon Sun Swaggart, was a sharecropper, grocery store manager, moonshiner, fiddle player and occasional preacher, and his mother, Minnie Bell (nee Herron), was from the same rural background. One cousin was the future rocknroll star Jerry Lee Lewis and another the country and western musician Mickey Gilley.\n\nSwaggart himself had a fine baritone singing voice and might have followed Lewis. He was offered terms by the pioneering Sun Records producer Sam Phillips but turned him down because of his religious calling, which, unlike his cousins, forbade alcohol, dancing, tobacco and secular music.\n\nIt was said the cousins preached from the opposite shores of the river they called salvation. However it did not stop him later issuing bestselling gospel albums, including This Is Just What Heaven Means to Me, though he claimed characteristically that he had negotiated the contracts through Gods help: Could you take 90% and let me have 10%? The albums sold in their millions.\n\nSwaggart was ordained by the Pentecostal Assemblies of God sect in 1961 after several years of preaching around the south, began broadcasting to Christian religious radio stations a year later and in 1969 founded his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, from where he launched the weekly Camp Meeting Hour radio programme. He promoted himself as an old-fashioned, Holy Ghost-filled, shouting, weeping, soul-winning, Gospel preachin preacher. It was certainly entertaining.\n\nThe centre itself grew to hold a congregation of 7,000 and the purchase of a bankrupt television studio in 1975 expanded Swaggarts ministry across the country. Within a few years 200 local television companies were taking his daily programmes. Eventually it was beamed internationally and Swaggart briefly became the biggest star in the televangelical firmament.\n\nThere were also merchandising opportunities: the sale of knick-knacks including belt buckles, T-shirts, mugs, plates and even replicas of Jesuss crown of thorns. Swaggart himself contributed more than 50 books and bible study guides. The worship centre became the largest mail-order business in Louisiana and the church grounds expanded to 200 acres, at one stage including a bible college.\n\nSwaggart was less politically active nationally than his contemporaries Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, though he supported Robertsons presidential bid in 1988 and later voted for Donald Trump. But he did become entangled with the brutal anti-communist, pro-South African Mozambican resistance group Renamo during the countrys civil war of the 1980s, with his ministries accused of funding them and certainly supplying the guerrillas with improving literature.\n\nAt the age of 17 Swaggart had married his childhood sweetheart, 15-year-old Frances Anderson. He would later declare: It is impossible for me to stray. My wife is with me all the time. Im never alone.\n\nThis assertion was severely tested by the sex scandals, which came to light after Swaggart fell out with Gorman, both competing for similar television audiences in Louisiana. Swaggart got Gorman defrocked from the Assemblies of God after making allegations of adultery, which led Gorman to employ a private detective who recorded Swaggart visiting a sex worker at a Travel Inn on the outskirts of New Orleans.\n\nGorman offered a deal: he would not release the footage if Swaggart publicly apologised and withdrew his allegations, but when Swaggart did not answer the story rapidly went public.\n\nThis prompted Swaggarts highly public mea culpa to his television followers. Damp with sweat and ostentatiously crying he called on the Almightys help: I have sinned against you my Lord and I would ask that your precious blood would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of Gods forgiveness, not to be remembered against me any more.\n\nThe authorities were notably more forgiving than they had been to Gorman, suspending him from preaching for two years, which Swaggart ignored on the grounds that he could not afford the loss of earnings. Defrocked, he then became an independent preacher.\n\nScepticism about Swaggarts sincerity hardened even among his most devoted followers when three years later he was stopped by police while driving his white Jaguar erratically in Indio, California. His passenger told reporters: He asked me for sex. I mean thats why he stopped me. Thats what I do. Im a prostitute. She claimed the car had been swerving because he was trying to hide pornographic magazines under the drivers seat.\n\nWith that his national ministry effectively collapsed. He eventually reached a million-dollar settlement with Gorman, but the bible college, private jet and his and hers limousines had to go. He continued preaching but his ministry essentially passed to his son Donnie.\n\nFrances and Donnie survive him, as do several grandchildren and great-grandchildren."

A trial date was set for late August.\n\nU.S. Atty.

Were demanding they drop the charges now. Theyre insignificant, ridiculous, Montes said. The most it amounts to is that he was passing out personal protective equipment, which includes boxes of water, hand sanitizer and snacks.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Marine Corps could not immediately confirm Orellanas service record.\n\nMontes also challenged Essaylis argument that peaceful protesters have no need for protective equipment, pointing to myriad instances in which people have been seriously injured by Los Angeles police and county sheriffs deputies in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Times investigation last month highlighted incidents in which protesters allege Los Angeles Police Department officers fired rubber rounds and other crowd control munitions without warning in recent weeks, causing demonstrators and members of the media to suffer broken bones, concussions and other forms of severe harm.\n\nTimes staff writer Brittny Mejia contributed to this report."

        "content": "President Trump arrives for a dinner at the Huis ten Bosch Royal Palace in The Hague during the NATO summit Tuesday.\n\nSince beginning his second term earlier this year, President Trump has spoken optimistically about restarting denuclearization talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he met for a series of historic summits in 2018 and 2019 that ended without a deal.\n\nI have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, and well see what happens, but certainly hes a nuclear power, he told reporters at an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in March.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump attempted to send a letter to Kim via North Korean diplomats in New York, only to be rebuffed, according to Seoul-based NK News. And now, following the U.S. militarys strike on three nuclear facilities in Iran on Sunday, the chances of Pyongyang returning to the bargaining table have become even slimmer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor North Korea, which has conducted six nuclear tests over the years in the face of severe economic sanctions and international reprobation  and consequently has a far more advanced nuclear program than Iran  many analysts say the lesson from Sunday is clear: A working nuclear deterrent is the only guarantor of security.\n\nMore than anything, the North Korean regime is probably thinking that they did well to dig in their heels to keep developing their nuclear program, said Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.\n\nA TV screen at the Seoul Railway Station shows the launch of a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile on Oct. 31. (Lee Jin-man / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think this strike means the end of any sort of denuclearization talks or diplomatic solutions that the U.S. had in mind in the past, he said. I dont think its simply a matter of worsened circumstances; I think the possibility has now gone close to zero.\n\nOn Monday, North Koreas foreign ministry condemned the U.S. strike on Iran as a violation of international law as well as the territorial integrity and security interests of a sovereign state, according to North Korean state media.\n\nThe present situation of the Middle East, which is shaking the very basis of international peace and security, is the inevitable product of Israels reckless bravado as it advances its unilateral interests through ceaseless war moves and territorial expansion, and that of the Western-style free order which has so far tolerated and encouraged Israeli acts, an unnamed ministry spokesperson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has threatened to attack North Korea before.\n\nEarly in Trumps first term, when Pyongyang successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the U.S. West Coast., administration officials reportedly considered launching a bloody nose strike  an attack on a nuclear site or military facility that is small enough to prevent escalation into full-blown war but severe enough to make a point.\n\nMilitary solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely, Trump wrote on social media in August 2017.\n\nWhile it is still uncertain how much damage U.S. stealth bombers inflicted on Irans nuclear sites at Natanz, Isfahan and Fordo  and whether they have kneecapped Irans nuclear program, as U.S. officials have claimed  experts say the feasibility of a similar attack against North Korea is much smaller.\n\nNorth Korea has been plowing through with their nuclear program for some time, so their security posture around their nuclear facilities is far more sophisticated than Iran, Kim Dong-yup said. Their facilities are extremely dispersed and well-disguised, which means its difficult to cripple their nuclear program, even if you were to successfully destroy the one or two sites that are known.\n\nKim Dong-yup believes that North Koreas enrichment facilities are much deeper than Irans and potentially beyond the range of the bunker buster bombs  officially known as the GBU-57 A/B  used Sunday. And unlike Iran, North Korea is believed to already have 40 to 50 nuclear warheads, making large-scale retaliation a very real possibility.\n\nA preemptive strike against North Korea would also do irreparable damage to the U.S.-South Korea alliance and would likely also invite responses from China and, more significantly, Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA mutual defense treaty signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un last June states that the two countries shall immediately provide military and other assistance to the other if it falls into a state of war due to armed invasion from an individual or multiple states.\n\nYet talk of such an attack in Trumps first term was soon replaced by what he has described as a friendship with Kim Jong Un, built over the 2018-19 summits, the first ever such meetings by a sitting U.S. president. Though the talks fell apart over disagreements on what measures North Korea would take toward disarmament and Trumps reluctance to offer sanctions relief, the summits ended on a surprisingly hopeful note, with the two leaders walking away as pen pals.\n\nAn undated photo provided on Sept. 13 by the North Korean government shows its leader, Kim Jong Un, center, visiting what the country says is a facility for nuclear materials in an undisclosed location in North Korea. (Associated Press)\n\nIn recent months, administration officials have said that the presidents goal remains the same: completely denuclearizing North Korea.\n\nBut the attack on Iran has made those old sticking points  such as the U.S. negotiating teams demand that North Korea submit a full list of its nuclear sites  even more onerous, said Lee Byong-chul, a nonproliferation expert who has served under two South Korean administrations.\n\nKim Jong Un will only give up his nuclear weapons when, as the English expression goes, hell freezes over, Lee said. And that alone shuts the door on any possible deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Lee believes that North Korea may be willing to come back to the negotiating table for a freeze  though not a rollback  of its nuclear program.\n\nBut from Trumps perspective, thats a retreat from the terms he presented at the [2019] Hanoi summit, he said. He would look like a fool to come back to sign a reduced deal.\n\nWhile some, like Kim Dong-yup, the professor, argue that North Korea has already proven itself capable of withstanding economic sanctions and will not overextend itself to have them removed, others point out that this is still the United States primary source of leverage  and that if Trump wants a deal, he will need to put it on the table.\n\nReal sanctions relief is still valuable, Stephen Costello, a non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nWhile he agrees that immediate denuclearization may be unrealistic, Costello has argued that even halting production of new fissile material, nuclear weapons and long-range missiles are well worth ending nonmilitary sanctions, such as those on energy imports or the export of textiles and seafood.\n\nRegardless of U.S. actions in the Middle East, the North Koreans would likely gauge any U.S. interest by how serious they are about early, immediate sanctions relief, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe attack on Iran will have other ramifications beyond Trumps dealmaking with Kim Jong Un.\n\nMilitary cooperation between North Korea and Iran, dating back to the 1980s and including arms transfers from North Korea to Iran, will likely accelerate.\n\nLee, the nonproliferation expert, said that the attack on Iran, which was the first real-world use of the United States bunker-buster bombs, may have been a boon to North Korea.\n\nIts going to be a tremendous lesson for them, he said. Depending on what the total damage sustained is, North Korea will undoubtedly use that information to better conceal their own nuclear facilities."

        "content": "Its a sunny morning in downtown Camden, Maine.\n\nInside the Villager Cafe, the scent of freshly brewed coffee lingers, and chatter is sporadically interrupted by chirps from a cafgoers walkie-talkie. Three women settle into a window-side table. Theyve known each other since high school, and they regularly meet to discuss politics.\n\nIts an apt place to do so. Print copies of the Midcoast Villager  an online daily and weekly print newspaper covering midcoast Maine  are displayed near the cash register. Merchandise bearing the papers mascot lines nearby shelves. Just upstairs, a small, bustling newsroom is rushing to meet the weekly print deadline.\n\nWhy We Wrote This A story focused on Trust Its no surprise that news outlets are struggling for both dollars and trust. In Camden, Maine, a local newspaper opened a caf to welcome in the community.\n\nThe Villager Cafe, which opened in April, isnt just a caf. Its a newsstand and events space for the Midcoast Villager. The newspaper wants the caf to be a third space for community engagement, in the words of deputy editor Alex Seitz-Wald.\n\nToday, both cratering trust in the media and declining readership have led some to wonder whether the United States is in a post-news era. Last year, 130 newspapers shut down at a rate of almost 2 1/2 per week, according to a report from Northwestern Universitys Local News Initiative. As of last October, 206 counties across the U.S. dont have a local news outlet at all.\n\nLocal media outlets, facing steep financial losses, are finding new ways to reengage with their audiences. Some, such as WBUR, an NPR affiliate in Boston, have opted for performance and event spaces; others, such as The Texas Tribune, host festivals.\n\nThe loss of local newspapers is really damaging to civic life and civil discourse, and the ability of average people to be informed about their community, says Meg Heckman, an associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\nIts a lot harder to know whats going on in town hall, [or] what changes to federal environmental policy might mean to rural farmers or fisheries or tourism, she adds.\n\nYou either grow or die\n\nReade Brower has long been regarded as Maines media mogul. In 2019, he owned six of Maines seven daily newspapers, more than 20 weekly publications, and three printing presses. In 2023, he sold the vast majority to the National Trust for Local News, a nonprofit. Four of the papers he held onto  the Camden Herald, the Republican Journal, The Courier-Gazette, and The Free Press, as well as an online news platform known as Village Soup  became the Midcoast Villager. It published its first issue in late 2024.\n\nHannah Hoggatt/Courtesy of the Midcoast Villager Copies of the Midcoast Villager, a newspaper covering midcoast Maine, are displayed at the Villager Cafe in Camden, May 27. The first issue was published fall 2024.\n\nLocals were unsurprised that the newspapers were struggling  and there was little pushback to consolidating the publications into one newspaper.\n\nNow, its so common to understand that media is not working as a business, says Kathleen Fleury Capetta, co-founder of the Midcoast Villager. The foundation was set for us.\n\nWith the advent of online platforms like Google, Facebook, and Craigslist, advertising revenue that long funded news publications has all but disappeared. U.S. newspapers earned $49 billion in advertising revenue in 2006; that number dropped to less than $10 billion in 2022.\n\nAround 85% of U.S. adults believe that local news outlets are at least somewhat important to the well-being of their local community, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey. But only 15% say theyve paid or given money to any local news source in the past year, which has largely remained unchanged since 2018.\n\nPeople have been curious to check out the caf, says Aaron Britt, publisher, peppering him with questions like: Is it open? Can I come in? Whats going on? I want to see it, says Mr. Britt. And Ive just heard like nothing but great things. People like the food, people run into everybody that they know.\n\nThe idea, he adds, is Community members can feel like, Oh, this is my spot.\n\nMr. Brower had long dreamed of putting cafs into every community in which he owned a paper. Ms. Capetta had previously been asked to plan and open a news caf in the Cayman Islands  though the concept fell apart due to the pandemic. Together, they came up with the Villager Cafe.\n\nI believe very strongly in the statement that you either grow or die, says Mr. Brower.\n\nMackenzie Farkus/The Christian Science Monitor Midcoast Villager co-founder Kathleen Fleury Capetta (left), publisher Aaron Britt (center), and deputy editor Alex Seitz-Wald, sit in the Villager Cafe, May 28.\n\nShifting perspectives\n\nAlongside the decline of local newspapers, the media industry is facing a lack of trust.\n\nFor the past three years, more U.S. adults have no trust at all in the media (36%) than trust it a great deal or fair amount, according to a 2024 Gallup poll. However, Americans have a more positive outlook of their local news according to 2024 polling by Pew, with 78% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans stating that local news media report news accurately.\n\nI think a lot of where we are today is due to the perception that there are editors and writers away in this tower who are covering issues, but theyre not fully connected with readers, Ms. Capetta says. Were trying to shift that perspective.\n\nEach Friday, a rotating Midcoast Villager editor hosts Fresh Brewed News, where members of the public can discuss local issues and gain insight into how the weeks stories came to be.\n\nTheres a Silent Reading Club, where people can commune with fellow readers for an hour of silent reading, bookended by a few minutes of conversation. In the future, Mr. Seitz-Wald hopes to hold debates on local issues.\n\nThe cafs goal at the very start has been, How do we connect our community and create a respectful place of dialogue? says Mr. Brower. We believe were achieving that.\n\nThough the caf model may be a step in the right direction toward fostering trust, Professor Heckman cautions against this model as a silver bullet for the struggling news industry.\n\nI dont think brewing coffee every morning is necessarily going to solve all of the audience trust issues out there, she says. I do think for a local audience, the ability to attach a physical location and names to faces, to personalities, to people who are in their community, they shift the dynamic a little bit.\n\nStaffers at the Midcoast Villager have already fielded calls from other media organizations interested in the approach.\n\nAnybody is welcome to call us up and steal our idea if they like it, Mr. Brower says.\n\nEditors Note: This article, originally published July 1, has been updated to correct Aaron Britts title in the text."

        "content": "Amazon Prime Day, aka the biggest sale of the year so far, is officially here. Prime members have four days (yes, four) to shop exclusive discounts across categories, including tech, beauty, home and kitchen, plus take advantage of limited-time promotions like Lightning Deals. And while hundreds of deals are available to shop right now, theyre not all worthwhile  in fact, most arent.

        "content": "Sae Joon Park, center, pictured with his son and daughter, self-deported to South Korea at the age of 55. Park, an Army veteran who grew up in Van Nuys and was awarded a Purple Heart, was threatened with being detained and deported by federal immigration forces.\n\nAn Army veteran who grew up in Van Nuys and was awarded a Purple Heart self-deported to South Korea this week as he was threatened with being detained and deported by federal immigration forces.\n\nOn Monday, veteran Sae Joon Park, who legally immigrated from South Korea when he was seven years old, grew up in Koreatown and the San Fernando Valley and held a green card, flew back to his homeland under threat of deportation at the age of 55. He said he is being forced to leave because of drug convictions nearly two decades ago that he said were a response to the PTSD he suffered after being shot during military action in Panama.\n\nIts unbelievable. Im still in disbelief that this has actually happened, Park said in a phone interview from Incheon early Wednesday morning. I know I made my mistakes  but its not like I was a violent criminal. Its not like Im going around robbing people at gunpoint or hurting anyone. It was self-induced because of the problems I had.\n\nSae Joon Park, an Army veteran with a Purple Heart. (From Sae Joon Park)\n\nAsked to comment on Park, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Park has an extensive criminal history and has been given a final removal order, with the option to self-deport.\n\nPark said he suffered from PTSD and addiction in the aftermath of being wounded when he was part of the U.S. forces that invaded Panama in 1989 to depose the nations de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega.\n\nBut now Park, a legal immigrant, is targeted by federal authorities in President Trumps recent immigration raids that have prompted widespread protests in Los Angeles and across the nation. Federal authorities have arrested more than 1,600 immigrants for deportation in Southern California between June 6 and 22, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA noncitizen is eligible for naturalization if they served honorably in the U.S. military for at least a year. Park served less than a year before he was wounded and honorably discharged.\n\nSince 2002, over 158,000 immigrant service members have become U.S. citizens.\n\nAs of 2021, the Department of Veteran Affairs and Department of Homeland Security are responsible for tracking deported veterans to make sure they still have access to VA benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParks parents divorced when he was a toddler, and his mother immigrated from South Korea to the United States. He followed her a year later. They first lived in Koreatown, moved to Panorama City and then Van Nuys. He graduated from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks in 1988.\n\nStruggling at first to learn English and acclimate with his classmates, he eventually became part of the Southern California skateboarding and surfing scene of the 1980s, which is when television editor Josh Belson met him. They have been close friends ever since.\n\nHes always got a smile, a very kind of vivacious energy about him, said Belson, who attended a nearby high school when they met. He was the kind of person you wanted to be around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating, Park said he wasnt ready to attend college, so he joined the military.\n\nThe Army provided not only turning me into a man, but also providing me with the GI Bill, so you can go to college later, and theyll pay for it. And the fact that I did believe in the country, the United States, he said. So I felt like I was doing something honorable. I was very proud when I joined the military.\n\nParks platoon was deployed to Panama in late 1989, where he said they experienced a firefight the first night there. The following day, he said he was carrying an M-16 when they raided the house of one of the witches Noriega allegedly followed. He said they saw a voodoo worship room with body parts and a cross painted in blood on the floor.\n\nWhile there, he heard gunfire from the backyard and returned fire. He was shot twice, in his spine and lower left back. The bullet to his spine was partially deflected by his dog tag, which Park believes is the reason he wasnt paralyzed. A military ambulance was delayed because of the firefight, but a Vietnam veteran who lived nearby rescued him, Park said.\n\nI just remember Im just lying in my own pool of blood and just leaking out badly. So he actually went home, got his pickup truck, put me in the back of his pickup truck with two soldiers, and drove me to the hospital, Park said.\n\nHe was then evacuated to an Army hospital in San Antonio. A four-star general awarded him a Purple Heart at his bedside. Then-President George H.W. Bush visited wounded soldiers there.\n\nCalifornia More immigrants opt to self-deport rather than risk being marched out like criminals Even in liberal-leaning California, undocumented immigrants who have worked here for decades are making plans to leave, choosing to depart on their own terms rather than risk being forced out with nothing.\n\nPark spent about two weeks there, and then went home for a month or so, until he could walk. His experience resulted in mental issues he didnt recognize, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy biggest issue at the time, more than my injuries, was  I didnt know what it was at the time, nobody did, because there was no such thing as PTSD at the time, he said. Eventually, I realized I was suffering from PTSD badly, nightmares every night, severe. I couldnt hear loud noises, and at that time in L.A., you would hear gunshots every night you left the house, so I was paranoid at all times. And being a man and being a tough guy, I couldnt share this with anyone.\n\nPark started self-medicating with marijuana, which he said helped him sleep. But he started doing harder drugs, eventually crack cocaine. He moved to Hawaii after his mother and stepfathers L.A. store burned during the 1992 riots, and married. After Park and his wife separated, he moved to New York City, where his addiction worsened.\n\nIt got really bad. It just got out of control  every day, every night, all day  just smoking, everything, Park said.\n\nOne night, in the late 2000s, he was meeting his drug dealer at a Taco Bell in Queens when police surrounded his car, and the dealer fled while leaving a large quantity of crack in his glove compartment, Park said.\n\nA judge sent Park to rehab twice, but he said he was not ready to get sober.\n\nI just couldnt. I was an addict. It was so hard for me to stay clean. Id be good for 30 days and relapse, he said. Id be good for 20 days and relapse. It was such a struggle. Finally, the judge told me, Mr. Park, the next time you come into my courtroom with the dirty urine, youre gonna go to prison. So I got scared.\n\nSo Park didnt return to court, drove to Los Angeles and then returned to Hawaii, skipping bail, which is an aggravated felony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did not know at the time jumping bail was an aggravated felony charge, and combined with my drug use, thats deportable for someone like me with my green card, he said.\n\nU.S. Marshals were sent looking for Park, and he said once he heard about this, he turned himself in in August 2009, because he didnt want to be arrested in front of his two children.\n\nHe served two years in prison and said immigration officials detained him for six months after he was released as he fought deportation orders. He was eventually released under deferred action, an act of prosecutorial discretion by the Department of Homeland Security to put off deportation.\n\nEvery year since, Park was required to check in with federal officials and show that he was employed and sober. Meanwhile, he had sole custody of his two children, who are now 28 and 25. He was also caring for his 85-year-old mother, who is in the early stages of dementia.\n\nDuring his most recent check-in, Park was about to be handcuffed and detained, but immigration agents placed an ankle monitor on him and gave him three weeks to get his affairs in order and self-deport. He is not allowed to return to the United States for 10 years. He worries he will miss his mothers passing and his daughters wedding.\n\nThats the biggest part. But  it could be a lot worse too. I look at it that way also, Park said. So Im grateful I made it out of the United States, I guess, without getting detained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always just assumed a green card, legal residency, is just like having citizenship, he added. I just never felt like I had to go get citizenship. And thats just being honest. As a kid growing up in the United States, Ive always just thought, hey, Im a green card holder, a legal resident, Im just like a citizen.\n\nHis condition has spiraled since then.\n\nAlright. Im losing it. Cant stop crying. I think PTSD kicking in strong, Park texted Belson on Thursday. Just want to get back to my family and take care of my mother ... Im a mess.\n\nTimes staff writer Nathan Solis contributed to this report."

        "content": "Ten people have been charged with attempted murder after allegedly ambushing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents in Texas on 4 July.\n\nFederal prosecutors said attackers drew the agents out of an Ice detention center in Alvarado, Texas, with fireworks and by vandalizing vehicles. They allegedly shot a police officer in the neck and unloaded between 20 and 30 rounds on immigration agents, and were later apprehended by local law enforcement near the scene.\n\nIt was a planned ambush with the intent to kill Ice correction officers, said Nancy Larson, US attorney for the northern district of Texas, at a press conference on Monday. Make no mistake, this was not a so-called peaceful protest  it was indeed an ambush.\n\nLarson said the assailants began shooting fireworks outside the Prairieland Ice Detection Center, about an hour south of Dallas in Alvarado, Texas, at approximately 10.37pm. The fireworks drew agents outside and found the group spray painting vehicles with Ice pig, traitor and other profanity, according to Larson.\n\nA gunman, who was positioned in the woods away from the group, then fired a shot at a local police officer who was also on the scene and hit him in the neck area, Larson said. She added that a second gunman unloaded between 20 and 30 rounds on Ice corrections officers, who she said were unarmed.\n\nThis was an egregious attack on federal and local law enforcement officers and it is part of an increasing trend of violence against them, Larson said, adding that a jammed AR-style rifle was later found abandoned in the woods.\n\nTen people, most of them from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, were charged with three counts of attempted murder. An 11th co-conspirator faces obstruction of justice charges.\n\nLarson said local sheriffs deputies caught the alleged assailants in two separate vehicles near the facility, both with tactical-style vests and weapons. One group of seven alleged assailants was also covered in mud.\n\nWe found masks, goggles, tactical gloves in a residence, said Larson, along with additional body armor  spray paint, fireworks and again insurrectionist materials.\n\nThe attack comes after police said a man with an assault rifle shot at officers leaving a Texas border patrol facility on Monday, before being killed by law enforcement. Hours before the attack his father told police he was looking for his son, who he said had psychological issues and was carrying weapons."

        "content": "Californias fight to rein in President Trumps deployment of troops to Los Angeles hinges on a 19th century law with a a blood-soaked origin and a name that seems pulled from a spaghetti western film.\n\nIn a pivotal ruling this week, Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer ordered the federal government to hand over evidence to state authorities seeking to prove that the actions of troops in Southern California violate the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which forbids soldiers from enforcing civilian laws.\n\nHow President Trump has used and is using the federalized National Guard and the Marines since deploying them at the beginning of June is plainly relevant to the Posse Comitatus Act, Breyer wrote Wednesday in his order authorizing limited expedited discovery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration objected to the move and has already once gotten a sweeping Breyer ruling that wouldve limited White House authority over the troops overturned by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThis time, the Northern District of California judge made clear he would only allow discovery as to the Posse Comitatus Act  signaling what could be the states last stand battle to prevent Marines and National Guard forces from participating in immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act dates back to the aftermath of the Civil War when the American government faced violent resistance to its efforts to rebuild Southern state governments and enforce federal law following the abolition of slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe text of the law itself is slight, its relevant section barely more than 60 words. Yet when it was enacted, it served as the legal epitaph to Reconstruction  and a preface to Jim Crow.\n\nIt has these very ignoble beginnings, said Mark P. Nevitt, a law professor at Emory University and one of the countrys foremost experts on the statute.\n\nBefore the Civil War, the U.S. military was kept small, in part to avoid the kinds of abuses American colonists suffered under the British.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthorities back then could marshal a crew of civilians, called a posse comitatus, to assist them, as sometimes happened in California during the Gold Rush. States also had militias that could be called up by the president to pad out the army in wartime.\n\nBut law enforcement by the U.S. military was rare and deeply unpopular. Historians have said the use of soldiers to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act  which saw escaped slaves hunted down and returned to the South  helped spark the Civil War.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has used constitutional maneuvers invented to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act to justify using troops to round up immigrants. Experts said leaders from the antebellum South demanded similar enforcement of the law.\n\nThe South was all for posse comitatus when it came to the Fugitive Slave Act, said Josh Dubbert, a historian at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library in Ohio.\n\nBut by the time Congress sent federal troops to begin Reconstruction in earnest in 1867, the landscape was very different.\n\nAfter white rioters razed Black neighborhoods in Memphis and mobs of ex-Confederate soldiers massacred Black demonstrators in New Orleans in the spring of 1866, most of the South [was] turned into military districts, said Jacob Calhoun, a professor of American history at Wabash College and an expert on Reconstruction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost scholars, let alone the American public, do not understand the scale of racial violence during Reconstruction, Calhoun said. They only send these troops in after unimaginable levels of violence.\n\nFreedmen voting in New Orleans, 1867. (Heritage Images via Getty Images)\n\nAt the polls, Black voters were met by white gangs seeking to prevent them from casting ballots.\n\nFor most of American history, the idea of an American army intervening in elections is a nightmare, Calhoun said. [Posse Comitatus] is reemphasizing this longstanding belief but for more nefarious purposes.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus language was tucked into an appropriations bill by Southern Democrats after their party won control of Congress in the election of 1876  possibly the most violent election in American history ,  Calhoun said.\n\nHistorians say white lawmakers in the post-war South sought to enshrine their ability to keep Black men from voting by barring federal forces from bolstering the local militias that protected them.\n\nOnce theyre in control of Congress, they want to cut the appropriations for the army, Dubbert said. They attach this amendment to [their appropriations bill] which is the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nThe bill won support from some Republicans, who resented the use of federalized troops to put down the Railroad Strike of 1877  the first national labor strike in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a moment in which white Northern congressmen surrender the South back to ex-Confederates, Calhoun said. With the Posse Comitatus Act, racial violence becomes the norm.\n\nYet the statute itself largely vanished from memory, little used for most of the next century.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act was forgotten for about 75 years, from after Reconstruction to basically the 1950s, when a defense lawyer made a challenge to a piece of evidence that the Army had obtained, Nevitt said. The case law is [all] after World War II.\n\nThose cases have largely turned on troops who arrest, search, seize or detain civilians  the normal thing the LAPD does on a daily basis, Nevitt said. The courts have stood by the bedrock principle that military personnel should not be used to enforce the law against civilians, he said, except in times of rebellion or other extreme scenarios.\n\nOur nation was forged in large part because the British military was violating the civil rights of colonists in New England, Nevitt said. I really cant think of a more important question than the militarys ability to use force against Americans.\n\nYet, the law is full of loopholes, scholars said  notably in relation to use of the National Guard.\n\nDepartment of Justice has argued Posse Comitatus does not apply to the militarys current actions in Southern California  and even if it did, the soldiers deployed there havent violated the law. It also claimed the 9th Circuit decision endorsing Trumps authority to call up troops rendered the Posse Comitatus issue moot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome experts feel Californias case is strong.\n\nYou literally have military roaming the streets of Los Angeles with civilian law enforcement, said Shilpi Agarwal, legal director of the ACLU of Northern California, Thats exactly what the [act] is designed to prevent.\n\nBut Nevitt was more doubtful. Even if Breyer ultimately rules that Trumps troops are violating the law and grants the injunction California is seeking, the 9th Circuit will almost certainly strike it down, he said.\n\nIts going to be an uphill battle, the attorney said. And if they find a way to get to the Supreme Court, I see the Supreme Court siding with Trump as well."

        "content": "British steelmakers face a nervous wait to discover if they will be hit by US tariffs, after the UK government said it was trying to complete a deal to protect the industry from Donald Trumps trade war.\n\nThe US has set a 50% tariff on foreign steel and aluminium imports. While the UK has brokered a reduced rate of 25% and is trying to bring it down to zero, a deal has not yet been completed.\n\nOn Monday, Downing Street refused to confirm it was confident it could eliminate US tariffs on UK steel before Trumps deadline on 9 July.\n\nA spokesperson for No 10 said: Our work with the US continues to get this deal implemented as soon as possible.\n\nThat will remove the 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminium, making us the only country in the world to have tariffs removed on these products.\n\nThe US agreed to remove tariffs on these products as part of our agreement on 8 May. It reiterated that again at the G7 last month. The discussions continue, and will continue to do so.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will send letters to trading partners without a deal by 9 July. On Monday, Trump caused some confusion over whether tariffs would be implemented by the 9 July deadline, before his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said tariff rates would take effect on 1 August.\n\nWhen asked again whether ministers were confident British producers will not be hit by the original 50% tariff, the Downing Street spokesperson said that discussions continue.\n\nWe have very close engagement with the US, and the US has been clear that it wants to keep talking to us to get the best deal for businesses and consumers on both sides, they said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day  we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the agreement, the UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs at all from the US, while the car industry will have 10% tariffs, down from 25%.\n\nThe US executive order implementing the deal highlighted the British steel industry, noting the UK has committed to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminium products  and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities.\n\nIt likely reflects worries in the US about Jingye Group, which owns British Steel despite the fact that the British government took control of the company in April to stop the closure of its Scunthorpe plant. The Trump administration has sought assurances that Chinas Jingye does not use British Steel as a route to circumvent US tariffs."

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP)  Barnard College has settled a lawsuit that accused the college of not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus, agreeing to a litany of demands that include banning masks at protests and refusing to meet or negotiate with a coalition of pro-Palestinian student groups, according to a statement released Monday.\n\nThe Manhattan college, an all-women's affiliate of Columbia University, will also establish a new Title VI coordinator to enforce against claims of discrimination. Beginning next semester, all students and staff will receive a message conveying a \"zero tolerance\" policy for harassment of Jewish and Israeli students.\n\nThe settlement was announced in a joint statement by Barnard and lawyers for two Jewish advocacy groups, Students Against Antisemitism and StandWithUs Center for Legal Justice, who brought the lawsuit last February on behalf of some Jewish and Israeli students.\n\nIn the statement, Barnard's president, Laura Ann Rosenbury, said the agreement \"reflects our ongoing commitment to maintaining a campus that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive for all members of our community.\"\n\nThe terms of the deal also drew immediate pushback from some students and faculty, who accused the university of capitulating to a legal strategy aimed at stifling legitimate pro-Palestinian activism on campus.\n\n\"This settlement appears to equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism,\" said Nara Milanich, a Barnard history professor who is Jewish. \"That is a problem for critical thought and academic freedom.\"\n\nAs part of the agreement, the college will adopt contentious federal guidance to \"consider\" the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism and its examples, which include certain critiques of Israel.\n\nA newly-appointed Title VI coordinator will oversee compliance with the policy and produce an annual report on antisemitism for university leaders.\n\nAdditionally, the university's leaders agreed not to recognize, meet or negotiate with Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the coalition behind last spring's student encampments. The group has called on both Columbia and Barnard to sever ties with companies that do business with Israel.\n\nAs part of the deal, the university will also affirm that its endowment will not be used for expressing political positions, including \"taking actions for the purpose of penalizing the government of a country or the commercial/financial activity within that country.\"\n\nThe agreement follows a federal lawsuit brought last February that accused Barnard and Columbia of allowing Jewish and Israeli students to be \"bombarded\" by antisemitism during protests that erupted against Israel's military campaign in Gaza.\n\nThe litigation against Columbia remains ongoing  though the university has already agreed to revamp its policies around protests, among other concessions made under threat from the Trump administration.\n\nNew York University and Harvard University have entered into their own legal settlements following lawsuits focused on antisemitism.\n\nIn the lawsuit against Columbia and Barnard, Jewish and Israeli students said they were subject to unchecked harassment during protests by \"mobs of pro-Hamas students and faculty.\" Those who participated in the protests, including many Jewish students, have strongly disputed that characterization.\n\nThe lawsuit also claimed that students who served in Israel's military were singled out, with some left \"overwhelmed and unable to concentrate in class\" after encountering signs accusing Israel of committing genocide and social media posts from fellow students.\n\nStarting next semester, students will be reminded that they can be subject to discipline for off-campus conduct, including social media posts.\n\nBarnard will also restrict where, when and how students can protest. And the university will ban face masks at demonstration used to \"intimidate or interfere with the enforcement\" of school policies.\n\n\"Barnard's commitment to take meaningful actions to combat antisemitism demonstrates its leadership in the fight against antisemitism and upholding the rights of Jewish and Israeli students,\" said Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for the plaintiffs. \"I encourage other colleges and universities to do the right thing and follow Barnard's lead.\""

        "content": "A mother and her two young kids are fighting for their release from a Texas immigration detention center in what is believed to be the first lawsuit involving children challenging the Trump administrations policy on immigrant arrests at courthouses.\n\nThe lawsuit filed on June 24 argues that the familys arrests after fleeing Honduras and entering the United States legally using a Biden-era appointment app violate their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizure and their Fifth Amendment right to due process.\n\nThe big picture is that the executive branch cannot seize people, arrest people, detain people indefinitely when they are complying with exactly what our government has required of them, said Columbia Law School professor Elora Mukherjee, one of the lawyers representing the family.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nStarting in May, the country has seen large-scale arrests in which asylum-seekers appearing at routine court hearings have been arrested outside courtrooms as part of the White Houses mass deportation effort. In many cases, a judge will grant a government lawyers request to dismiss deportation proceedings, and then U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers will arrest the person and place them on expedited removal, a fast track to deportation.\n\nMs. Mukherjee said this is the first lawsuit filed on behalf of children to challenge the ICE courthouse arrest policy. The government has until July 1 to respond.\n\nThere have been other similar lawsuits, including in New York, where a federal judge ruled earlier this month that federal immigration authorities cant make civil arrests at the states courthouses or arrest anyone going there for a proceeding.\n\nThe Texas lawsuit was filed using initials for the children and Ms. Z for the mother. Their identities have not been released because of concerns for their safety.\n\nFor weeks in the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, the mother has suspected her 6-year-old sons health is in decline, Ms. Mukherjee said.\n\nThe mother, son, and 9-year-old daughter fled Honduras in October 2024 due to death threats, according to the lawsuit. They entered the U.S. using the CBP One app and were paroled into the country by the DHS, which determined they didnt pose a danger to the community, Ms. Mukherjee said. They were told to appear at a Los Angeles immigration court on May 29.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ended CBP One for new entrants on his first day in office after more than 900,000 people had been allowed in the country using the app since it was expanded to include migrants in January 2023.\n\nDuring the familys hearing, the mother tried to tell the judge that they wished to continue their cases for asylum, Ms. Mukherjee said. Homeland Security moved to dismiss their cases, and the judge immediately granted that motion.\n\nWhen they stepped out of the courtroom, they found men in civilian clothing believed to be ICE agents who arrested the family, Ms. Mukherjee said. They spent about 11 hours at an immigrant processing center in Los Angeles and were each only given an apple, a small packet of cookies, a juice box, and water.\n\nThey were later taken to the processing center, where they have been held ever since.\n\nThe family is suffering in this immigration detention center, she said. The kids are crying every night. Theyre praying to God for their release from this detention center.\n\nTheir lawyers have filed an appeal of the immigration judges May decision, but theyre at risk of being deported within days because the government says they are subject to expedited removal, Ms. Mukherjee said.\n\nThe arrests of the family were illegal and unjustified, said Kate Gibson Kumar, an attorney for the Texas Civil Rights Project who is also representing the family.\n\nThe essential question in our case is, when you have these families who are doing everything right, especially with young children, should there be some protection there? Ms. Gibson Kumar said. We say yes.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press. Nadia Lathan in Austin, Texas, contributed to this report."

The NASA-funded survey telescope  which is actually made up of two telescopes in Hawaii, one in Chile and a fourth in South Africa  is designed to scan the entire sky several times each night, searching for asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth.\n\nResearchers combed through archival data from three different ATLAS telescopes and the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in California, and they found corresponding observations that helped confirm the discovery. Other telescopes around the world also joined the effort, according to NASA.\n\nESAs Planetary Defenders are observing the object, provisionally known as #A11pl3Z, right now using telescopes around the world, the European Space Agency said Wednesday in a post on X.\n\nInterstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. David Rankin / Saguaro Observatory\n\nThe comet is about 420 million miles away, moving quickly from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, NASA said in a blog post about the discovery. Sagittarius is a prominent constellation in the Southern Hemisphere that points toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nThe agency said 3I/ATLAS will swing closest to the sun around Oct. 30, passing at a distance of approximately 130 million miles, or just inside the orbit of Mars.\n\nNASA said the comet should be visible to ground-based observatories through September, allowing time for scientists to glean additional details about the cosmic interloper, including its size. After September, 3I/ATLAS will be too close to the sun to observe with telescopes, but the object is expected to be visible again in early December, when it emerges on the other side of the sun.\n\nThe months ahead offer a rare opportunity to study a celestial tourist from beyond our solar system. The first confirmed interstellar object seen passing through the solar system was discovered in 2017 by the University of Hawaiis Pan-STARRS1 telescope. The rocky object, named Oumuamua (Hawaiian for a messenger from afar arriving first), has a reddish hue and is elongated like a cigar, according to NASA.\n\nThe only other known interstellar object to pay a visit is 2I/Borisov, a comet that was discovered in 2019 by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov."

        "content": "Former federal prosecutor Anthony Capozzolo analyzes the Sean Combs trial verdict\n\nNPR's A Martinez asks defense attorney and former prosecutor Anthony Capozzolo about the prosecution's failure to secure guilty verdicts in the most serious charges brought against Sean Combs.\n\nA MARTNEZ, HOST:\n\nFor more on the Sean Combs verdict, we've called up Anthony Capozzolo. He's a former federal prosecutor, now a defense lawyer with the firm Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss, and he's represented plaintiffs in high-profile sex trafficking cases. So, Anthony, Sean Combs acquitted on most serious charges, convicted on two others. He seemed to take this as a big win. How did it look from your end?\n\nANTHONY CAPOZZOLO: I think his exuberance was well described by your prior reporter. It looks like, absent a full acquittal, this was the next best result they could've hoped for, given the sentencing ranges of the charges for which he was acquitted of, which could've led to a life imprisonment sentence.\n\nMARTNEZ: As you were keeping track of what was being presented in this case - the evidence - how much did that give you a sense of the verdict that ultimately occurred?\n\nCAPOZZOLO: So I think the verdict was surprising to many of the people who were in the courtroom watching. There was substantial evidence related to at least the sex trafficking charges for which he was acquitted, in which there were allegations of force and violence resulting in the participation in the sex business for which he was charged and the other activities. And so it was surprising that he wasn't convicted of at least the sex trafficking charges.\n\nMARTNEZ: Yeah, that video in the hotel with Cassie Ventura, I mean, it's been out there for so long. And I think that left people with the impression, well, there's no way that Sean Combs is going to beat this. But in some senses, I guess, in the grand scheme of things, it seems like he did.\n\nCAPOZZOLO: Yeah, it appears that the defense argument that meant to compartmentalize the domestic violence as something separate from of the - what the government's allegation that there was an enterprise, a criminal enterprise designed for the purpose of using force to engage in these sexual - the freak-offs that were described during the trial. It appears that the jury accepted the fact that there was domestic violence within his relationships, but that was not part of a criminal enterprise. It was not part of an ongoing activity of sex trafficking either.\n\nMARTNEZ: Do you think his celebrity status influenced the outcome at all in this case?\n\nCAPOZZOLO: There's no question to me that high-profile celebrity trials are more - much more difficult because jurors, regardless, you know, everyone's a human being. They are affected by what they know in the past. And people form opinions about celebrities, and it's very hard to convince them that they may have engaged in conduct of a very serious criminal nature. And so the bar appears to be much higher for individuals like Sean Combs.\n\nMARTNEZ: Considering how, you know, high profile this case was for someone out there that is considering, you know, maybe testifying because maybe they were sex trafficked or something like that. A case like this and an outcome like this, could this have some kind of chilling effect on someone? And you were a former prosecutor, so I'm sure you've tried to get people to say to take the stand on things like this.\n\nCAPOZZOLO: Yes, it's certainly the case where victims have seen high-profile individuals get acquitted that they realize their risks. Obviously, any person who's a victim of a crime feels like they're at risk when they have to go to trial and testify in open court against individuals who committed serious crimes against them. And this can certainly be a deterrent, and it can be a deterrent to prosecutors. After the Bear Stearns mortgage fraud case against Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, the government was very reluctant, and you saw very few mortgage fraud prosecutions. So, you know, this could have an effect on prosecutors as well.\n\nMARTNEZ: Quickly, what kind of sentence do you think Sean Combs is likely to receive?\n\nCAPOZZOLO: Since the judge held Sean Combs and denied the bail application, I think he will still take the charges seriously. And he does face - even with the time he's had in, which he'll get credit for, I think he does still face a period of imprisonment, you know, probably something like five years or less, which may result in him continuing to be imprisoned.\n\nMARTNEZ: That's defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Anthony Capozzolo. Thank you very much.\n\nCAPOZZOLO: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SNAAP'S \"SMOKE BAR\")\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Official U.S. records dramatically underestimate mortality and life expectancy disparities for Native Americans, according to a new, groundbreaking study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association . The research, led by the Boston University School of Public Health, provides compelling evidence of a profound discrepancy between actual and officially reported statistics on the health outcomes of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the U.S.\n\nThe study, novel in its approach, tracks mortality outcomes over time among self-identified AI/AN individuals in a nationally representative cohort known as the Mortality Disparities in American Communities. The researchers linked data from the U.S. Census Bureaus 2008 American Community Survey with official death certificates from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Vital Statistics System from 2008 through 2019, and found that the life expectancy of AI/AN populations was 6.5 years lower than the national average. They then compared this to data from the CDCs WONDER database , and found that their numbers were nearly three times greater than the gap reported by the CDC.\n\nIndeed, the study found that the life expectancy for AI/AN individuals was just 72.7 years, comparable to that of developing countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers also uncovered widespread racial misclassification. The study reports that some 41% of AI/AN deaths were incorrectly classified in the CDC WONDER database, predominantly misrecorded as White. These systemic misclassifications drastically skewed official statistics, presenting AI/AN mortality rates as only 5% higher than the national average. When they adjusted the data to account for those misclassifications, the researchers found that the actual rate was 42% higher than initially reported.\n\nThe issue of racial misclassification is not new for us at all, said Nanette Star, director of policy and planning at the California Consortium for Urban Indian Health. The recent tendency for journalists and politicians to use umbrella terms like Indigenous rather than the more precise American Indian and Alaska Native can obscure the unique needs, histories and political identities of AI/AN communities, Star noted, and contribute to their erasure in both data and public discourse. That is the word we use  erasure  and it really does result in that invisibility in our health statistics, she said.\n\nIssues related to racial misclassification in public records persist across the entire life course for AI/AN individuals, from birth to early childhood interventions to chronic disease and death. Star noted that in California, especially in urban regions like Los Angeles, Native individuals are frequently misidentified as Latino or multiracial, which profoundly distorts public health data and masks the extent of health disparities. It really does mask the true scale of premature mortality and health disparities among our communities, Star said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther, said Star, the lack of accurate data exacerbates health disparities. It really is a public health and justice issue, she said. If you dont have those numbers to support the targeted response, you dont get the funding for these interventions or even preventative measures.\n\nAccording to U.S. Census data, California is home to the largest AI/AN population in the United States. That means it has a unique opportunity to lead the nation in addressing these systemic issues. With numerous federally and state-recognized tribes, as well as substantial urban AI/AN populations, California can prioritize collaborative and accurate public health data collection and reporting.\n\nStar noted that current distortions are not always malicious but often stem from a lack of training. She suggested that California implement targeted training programs for those charged with recording this data, including funeral directors, coroners, medical doctors and law enforcement agents; allocate dedicated resources to improve the accuracy of racial classification on vital records; and strengthen partnerships with tribal leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study authors suggest similar approaches, and there are numerous examples of successful cases of Indigenous-led health partnerships seen across Canada and the U.S. that have helped reduce health disparities among AI/AN communities that could be used as a template.\n\nThese efforts would not only help to move toward rectifying historical inaccuracies, but also ensure that AI/AN communities receive equitable health resources and policy attention.\n\nWhen AI/AN people are misclassified in life and in death, it distorts public health data and drives inequities even deeper, said Star. Accurate data isnt just about numbers  its about honoring lives, holding systems accountable and making sure our communities are seen and served."

        "content": "CNN \n\nWhat does intimacy look like for seniors? Theres no end to sex scenes and other steamy content featuring the young and unwrinkled, but past a certain age, popular culture largely draws a blank  or treats sex as a punchline.\n\nLast year, the artist Marilyn Minter set out to change that, gathering a group of men and women aged 70 and older in her New York studio to showcase a lesser-seen side of sex and relationships. In erotic and colorful images, the seniors are stripped down to lingerie or briefs; they hug, kiss and caress each other in the heat of the moment. The photographs beckon our attention to challenge something still seen as taboo, showing playful, loving moments of pleasure.\n\nTheres so much contempt for elder sex. Even one of the models that I worked with said, Who wants to see all these? Minter recalled in a video call with CNN.\n\nMy whole thought process going into it was that were pioneers, she continued of the unabashedly sexualized context. Nobodys ever shot elder people affectionately, and with any kind of elegance. And that was my goal  to make to make them look very desirable.\n\n\"Elder Sex\" is Marilyn Minter's full set of images originally shot for a New York Times Magazine story on senior sex and intimacy. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy Marilyn Minter & LGDR\n\nA handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying a candid editorial feature about seniors sex lives. Minter is now publishing the series in full in the forthcoming book Elder Sex, and exhibiting them at New York gallery LGDR. The exhibition, which opened in April, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective Pretty/Dirty in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work.\n\nSeeking partners\n\nIn Elder Sex, Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today  and despite stars such as Lady Gaga and Lizzo posing for her  Minter couldnt find enough real couples willing to participate.\n\nThe images \"give permission to people who feel shame about their sexual urges,\" Minter said. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR\n\nWe wanted to (include) all races, all types of sex, Minter explained. We had a lot of trouble getting models. Im 74. I asked all my friends  in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships  and none of them would do it.\n\nIn the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. She paired them together in her studio, photographing them behind a panel of frozen glass  a trick to achieve the steamy, wet look without battling the ephemerality of water vapor. During their shoots, Minter said all her models, who were as old as 89 years old, told her they still had regular, enjoyable sex lives. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged.\n\nSeniors do have regular sex lives, but it's rarely discussed. Minter says all her models told her they still enjoy intimacy. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR\n\nMinter believes theres a sense of freedom in sex later in life that, for many people, can take time to reach.\n\nWhen youre young and having sex, its a little more performative than it is when youre 80, she said. As an older person, Youre thinking, This is me. Take it or leave it. Im just going to enjoy myself. Im not going to fake anything here.\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nMinter acknowledges that sex and self-image is fraught for women of all ages  older women are rarely seen or taken seriously as having intimate needs, while for younger women, sexual agency is often a tightrope walk  too much of it and you can be excoriated and slut-shamed, Minter said.\n\nWhen youre 25, theres just so much fear about young women owning sexual agency  its just terrifying to people, she said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images 01:51 - Source: CNN Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images 01:51\n\nBut the artist sees some progress in who gets to be seen as desirable on our television screens, reflecting a burgeoning broader shift in cultural attitudes around sex. She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of The Golden Girls and Sex and the City, who are the same age at the time of the latters reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNNs parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery). The 50s look a lot different in the 2020s! a caption exclaimed.\n\nThough The Golden Girls also delved into romance and intimacy  and was widely-viewed as remarkably sex-positive for its time  theres a stark contrast in how women in their 50s are presented across the two shows.\n\nI thought, Okay, heres why its different, she said. Number one: People live a lot longer, and theyre healthier Number two: theres this thing called Viagra. Minter laughed, adding: But who retired at 54? To a home in Florida with three other ladies? What?\n\nMinter hopes \"Elder Sex\" will serve as a radical body of work and will help normalize sex at older ages. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR\n\nShe hopes Elder Sex will not only serve as a much-needed visual reference for what intimacy can look like at older ages, but will also resonate for people who feel like their desires  and lives  are overlooked.\n\nIt gives permission to people who feel shame about their sexual urges, she said. I want this to give them permission to explore that and erase the shame.\n\nElder Sex, published by JBE Books, is available now."

        "content": "In a major ruling on Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with parents in a case involving religious freedom and public education.\n\nThe justices held that a group of Maryland parents can opt their children out of curriculum they say violates their religious beliefs while their lawsuit against the school district continues. The ruling broke 6-3 along the courts ideological lines.\n\nThe high courts opinion comes amid ongoing clashes over cultural issues and parental rights and, more broadly, the fundamental purpose of American public schools. In this case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, the conservative majority decided that the Montgomery County Board of Education infringed on parents First Amendment rights by preventing them from withdrawing their children from instruction involving LGBTQ-themed books.\n\nWhy We Wrote This In a closely watched case about religious freedom and public education, the Supreme Court sided with parents who wanted to opt their children out of LGBTQ-themed materials.\n\nThe Muslim, Catholic, and Ukrainian Orthodox parents that filed the lawsuit argue the boards policy violates their right to exercise their religion freely. In the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito said that they are likely to succeed with their claims.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long recognized the rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children, he wrote. And we have held that those rights are violated by government policies that substantially interfer[e] with the religious development of children.\n\nThe decision is a step in the right direction, says Neal McCluskey, director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute.\n\nIts better than not allowing opt-outs, in terms of freedom, he says. Now, At least if you think somethings being imposed on your kids in violation of your religion, you can remove them from that lesson.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, disagreeing with the notion that the decision simply upholds high court precedent. The ruling, she wrote, will have a much broader impact.\n\nThe Court invents a constitutional right to avoid exposure to subtle themes contrary to the religious principles that parents wish to instill in their children, she added. The result will be chaos for this Nations public schools.\n\nJustin Driver, a Yale Law School professor who was a co-author of a brief in support of the school board, agrees.\n\nThis decision succeeds in opening Pandoras box in countless classrooms located in our nations public schools, he said in an email. It unwisely grants parents and students the authority to, in effect, veto individual school lessons and assignments, thereby wreaking educational havoc.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Reuters U.S. Supreme Court Justices (left to right) Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Brett Kavanaugh wait to leave the stage at the conclusion of the President Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Jan. 20, 2025, in Washington.\n\nParents rights and a controversial curriculum\n\nThe curriculum at issue in the case is a selection of LGBTQ-inclusive picture books to be taught for students from kindergarten through fifth grade. The books have titles such as Pride Puppy, Uncle Bobbys Wedding, and Intersection Allies, which address gender and sexuality.\n\nThe stories are about a family attending a Pride parade, a niece meeting her uncles husband-to-be, a prince falling in love with a knight as they battle a dragon in a mythical kingdom, a girl feeling nervous about giving a valentine to her crush, and a transgender boy sharing his gender identity with his family, according to a legal filing by the Montgomery County Board of Education and superintendent.\n\nThe school board argues that the books, which were approved for English language arts instruction in elementary schools, align with its attempts to better represent the diversity of students and families. Montgomery County Public Schools, the largest district in Maryland, serves just shy of 160,000 students outside Washington, D.C., and is one of the most religiously diverse places in the United States.\n\nThe school district said the books arent used in any lessons about gender or sexuality. Nor is any student asked or expected to change his or her views about his or her own, or any other students, sexual orientation or gender, their brief states.\n\nParents from diverse faith backgrounds, however, want to be able to pull their children from any instruction using the books. In the majority opinion, Justice Alito said they have that right. The books at issue, he wrote, are clearly designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated and certain contrary values and beliefs as things to be rejected.\n\nThe boards policy, he noted, encourages teachers to correct children and accuse them of being hurtful when they express a degree of religious confusion.\n\nWhat the parents seek here is not the right to micromanage the public school curriculum, but rather to have their children opt out of a particular educational requirement that burdens their well-established right to direct the religious upbringing of their children, he concluded.\n\nUnlimited opt-outs?\n\nCountering that assertion, the courts three liberal justices voiced concerns about the slippery slope the ruling may create. Does it tee up an avalanche of lawsuits demanding faith-based opt-outs from other coursework, from evolution to womens roles in society?\n\nNever, in the context of public schools or elsewhere, has this Court held that mere exposure to concepts inconsistent with ones religious beliefs could give rise to a First Amendment claim, says Justice Sotomayor in her dissent.\n\nThe majority opinion creates a very amorphous standard, says Ira Lupu, a professor emeritus at George Washington University Law School who co-signed an amicus brief in support of the school board.\n\nThe opinion made no attempt to limit its holding to LGBTQ+ issues, he adds.\n\nThat, he suggests, upends precedent that parents could not object simply to their childrens exposure to ideas their parents disagree with. This has been the law for 40 years. ... If its only exposure, and not compelled affirmation of some kind, then your religious freedom is not undermined.\n\nIn a press call shortly after the opinion came down, Grace Morrison, a Montgomery County mother of a child with Down syndrome, called the ruling a triumph for families.\n\nGiven [my daughters] learning challenges, she struggles to grasp why her parents and teachers might disagree, says Ms. Morrison. Unfortunately, we had to remove her from the school to protect her from that confusion, a sacrifice that no parent should be forced to make.\n\nA chilling effect is also likely, says Dr. McCluskey from the Cato Institute.\n\nWhat I expect well continue to see is that if a public school serves a population that has a lot of disagreement about topics, he says, theyll tend to avoid topics that are controversial."

        "content": "If the last-minute twist at the Oscars was seen to echo all the last-minute twists in American culture latelythe Super Bowl, the electiona silly five-minute segment earlier in the night should be noted for what it captured about the countrys ongoing tensions and tastes in iPhone peripherals.\n\nHost Jimmy Kimmels team arranged for a sightseeing bus of supposedly real tourists to walk into the room, expecting a museum exhibit about the Oscars but instead finding themselves in the middle of the actual thing. Welcome to the Dolby Theater, Kimmel announced. This is the home of the Academy Awards, which are, in fact, happening right now.\n\nThe bit was both amusing and squirmy: a weird microcosm of Hollywoods relationship with America, Americas relationship with the media, and Jimmy Kimmels ability to make everything a little more awkward than it needs to be.\n\nThe Hunger for Folk Heroes (and Memes)\n\nAt the front of the pack was the man who would be the moments breakout star, Gary from Chicago. In a room of tuxes, he wore basketball shorts, a baseball cap, and a Hollywood sweatshirt, with the gender-progressive touches of a purple phone case and a bag that might have been his fiancees purse. If the glitz ambush intimidated him, he showed no signs of it, happily introducing himself to stars and snappily replying to Kimmels jokes. On social media, pop cultures craving for quirky symbolic everymensee: Ken Bone, Joe the Plumberquickly made itself known. So did the cravings of various corporate marketing teams.\n\nOur Collective Phone Addiction\n\nThe dozen or so tourists seemed to realize what was happening at different rates, and with different emotionsfear, elation, nonchalancebut were united in keeping their phones in front of their faces. You know were on TV so you dont need to do that, Kimmel said as Gary kept filming the room. His reply: I know but I want to. I want to.\n\nThe phone accessories themselves could make for a post-show fashion column: one woman had a sparkling jeweled case, another wielded a selfie stick as if it were a talisman. Devices in hand, the group pulled celebs in for selfies; Gary even handed his phone to Mahershala Ali as he posed with the actors Oscar.\n\nFor the tourists, it was a rare chance to see in the flesh people normally only ever seen on a screen. Yet they still insisted on having a screen between them.\n\nPiercing the Hollywood Bubble \n\nIn an era when Americans have become sharply aware of how isolated its various niches arepolitically, socially, geographicallyworkaday citizens from around the country were literally bussed in for cultural exchange with the cultural elite. The stars received them warmly: Ryan Gosling offered up some sort of present to Gary, Jennifer Anniston handed over her sunglasses, Meryl and Mahershala and others grinned and hugged. Denzel Washington even married Gary and his fiancee Vicky, though it must be said this particular cinematic icon seemed in a bit of a hurry to return to his seat.\n\n or Reinforcing It\n\nhistory, the writer Walter Kirn The alternate political reading of the moment was that the regular folks were treated patronizingly, expected to react with gratitude and awe at the mere fact of breathing the same air as famous people. Kimmel seemed a little too insistent that the tourists be wowed, and an awkward image was set when Gary started kissing actresses hands: He wanted to do it, but it looked a lot like royalty receiving a supplicant. Well that was the most condescending moment in Oscarshistory, the writer Walter Kirn tweeted . Real people on parade. Werent they cute?\n\nLucy Nicholson / Reuters\n\nOscars (Host) So White\n\nThe tourists were a mix of white and black and brown men and women. But Kimmel made the diversity seem anything but normal by using tired humor about funny nameswhich is to say, names unusual to white Americans. As the tourists entered the room, he had the crowd shout out MAHERSHALA!, the name of Moonlights Best Supporting Actor winner. Later, Kimmel reacted with horror when a woman of Asian descent told Kimmel her name rhymed with jewelry. When her husband said his name was Patrick, Kimmel replied with mock relief, See, thats a name.\n\nAt an event that has recently been accused of white supremacy, this was a pretty tone-deaf shtick. But Gary, of course, helped deflate it. I feel like youre ignoring the white celebrities, Kimmel said. Gary: Because I am, though!\n\nThe Insanity of Live TV\n\nMy stress reflexes were in full effect watching the segment, and judging from the cringing reactions on Twitter, I wasnt alone. Its definitely possible the tourists were just actors, or that theyd at least been coached to a greater extent than we were led to believe. But still, the spectacle of chaos in a space as highly choreographed, as widely watched, and as culturally fraught as the Oscars was riveting. At the very end of the night, viewers would be reminded of what makes live TV like this so electrifyingthe potential for disaster, and miracles."

        "content": "BEERSHEBA, Israel  American contractors guarding aid distribution sites in Gaza are using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food, according to accounts and videos obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nTwo U.S. contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were revealing their employers internal operations, said they were coming forward because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous and irresponsible practices. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open license to do whatever they wished.\n\nThey said their colleagues regularly lobbed stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians. One contractor said bullets were fired in all directions  in the air, into the ground and at times toward the Palestinians, recalling at least one instance where he thought someone had been hit.\n\nThere are innocent people being hurt. Badly. Needlessly, the contractor said.\n\nHe said American staff on the sites monitor those coming to seek food and document anyone considered suspicious. He said they share such information with the Israeli military.\n\nChildren, who were injured by Israeli attacks while waiting to receive food aid, at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza on Thursday. Abdallah F.s. Alattar / Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nVideos provided by one of the contractors and taken at the sites show hundreds of Palestinians crowded between metal gates, jostling for aid amid the sound of bullets, stun grenades and the sting of pepper spray.\n\nOther videos include conversation between English-speaking men discussing how to disperse crowds and encouraging each other after bursts of gunfire. NBC News has not obtained or reviewed the videos.\n\nThe testimonies from the contractors  combined with the videos, internal reports and text messages obtained by the AP  offer a rare glimpse inside the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the newly created, secretive American organization backed by Israel to feed the Gaza Strips population. Last month, the U.S. government pledged $30 million for the group to continue operations  the first known U.S. donation to the group, whose other funding sources remain opaque.\n\nIn a statement issued in response to the APs report, GHF said they had launched an investigation, which included reviewing the videos, and concluded that the claims in the story are categorically false, and questioned the credibility of the reporting. The organization added that they are pursuing legal action against the news outlet.\n\nJournalists have been unable to access the GHF sites, located in Israeli military-controlled zones. The AP and NBC News cannot independently verify the contractors stories.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials in Switzerland initiated proceedings to dissolve the Geneva branch of the GHF, citing legal shortcomings in its establishment, Reuters reported.\n\nThe group is registered in the U.S. state of Delaware and had registered an affiliate in Geneva on February 12. The Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (ESA), a Swiss regulatory body, told Reuters the GHF had not fulfilled certain legal requirements including having the correct number of board members, a postal address or a Swiss bank account.\n\nGHF confirmed to the ESA that it had never carried out activities in Switzerland...and that it intends to dissolve the Geneva-registered (branch), the ESA said in a statement obtained by Reuters.\n\nA spokesperson for Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF, told the AP that there have been no serious injuries at any of their sites to date. In scattered incidents, security professionals fired live rounds into the ground and away from civilians to get their attention. That happened in the early days at the the height of desperation where crowd control measures were necessary for the safety and security of civilians, the spokesperson said.\n\nGazas more than 2 million Palestinians are living through a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the 21-month war, Israel has bombarded and laid siege to the strip, leaving many teetering on the edge of famine, according to food security experts.\n\nFor 2 1/2 months before GHFs opening in May, Israel blocked all food, water and medicine from entering Gaza, claiming Hamas was stealing the aid being transported under a preexisting system coordinated by the United Nations. It now wants GHF to replace that U.N. system. The U.N. says its Gaza aid operations do not involve armed guards.\n\nOver 57,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the war erupted, according to the territorys Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants.\n\nGHF is an American organization, registered in Delaware and established in February to distribute humanitarian aid during the ongoing Gaza humanitarian crisis. Since the GHF sites began operating more than a month ago, Palestinians say Israeli troops open fire almost every day toward crowds on roads heading to the distribution points, through Israeli military zones. Several hundred people have been killed and hundreds more wounded, according to Gazas Health Ministry and witnesses.\n\nIn response, Israels military says it fires only warning shots and is investigating reports of civilian harm. It denies deliberately shooting at any innocent civilians and says its examining how to reduce friction with the population in the areas surrounding the distribution centers.\n\nPalestinians at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City mourn relatives who were killed while heading to an aid distribution hub. Jehad Alshrafi / AP\n\nAPs reporting for this article focuses on what is happening at the sites themselves. Palestinians arriving at the sites say they are caught between Israeli and American fire, said the contractor who shared videos with the AP.\n\nWe have come here to get food for our families. We have nothing, he recounted Palestinians telling him. Why does the [Israeli] army shoot at us? Why do you shoot at us?\n\nA spokesperson for the GHF said there are people with a vested interest in seeing it fail and are willing to do or say almost anything to make that happen. The spokesperson said the team is composed of seasoned humanitarian, logistics and security professionals with deep experience on the ground. The group says it has distributed the equivalent of more than 50 million meals in Gaza in its food boxes of staples.\n\nGHF says that it has consistently shown compassionate engagement with the people of Gaza.\n\nThroughout the war, aid distribution has been marred by chaos. Gangs have looted trucks of aid traveling to distribution centers and mobs of desperate people have also offloaded trucks before theyve reached their destination. Earlier this month, at least 51 Palestinians were killed and more than 200 wounded while waiting for the U.N. and commercial trucks to enter the territory, according to Gazas Health Ministry and a local hospital. Israels military acknowledged several casualties as soldiers opened fire on the approaching crowd and said authorities would investigate.\n\nAP spoke to the two contractors for UG Solutions, an American outfit subcontracted to hire security personnel for the distribution sites. They said bullets, stun grenades and pepper spray were used at nearly every distribution, even if there was no threat.\n\nVideos of aid being dispensed at the sites seen by the AP appear to back up the frenetic scenes the contractors described. The footage was taken within the first two weeks of its distributions  about halfway into the operations.\n\nIn one video, what appear to be heavily armed American security contractors at one of the sites in Gaza discuss how to disperse Palestinians nearby. One is heard saying he has arranged for a show of force by Israeli tanks.\n\nI dont want this to be too aggressive, he adds, because this is calming down.\n\nAt that moment, bursts of gunfire erupt close by, at least 15 shots. Whoo! Whoo! one contractor yelps.\n\nI think you hit one, one says.\n\nThen comes a shout: Hell, yeah, boy!\n\nThe cameras view is obscured by a large dirt mound.\n\nThe contractor who took the video told AP that he saw other contractors shooting in the direction of Palestinians who had just collected their food and were departing. The men shot both from a tower above the site and from atop the mound, he said. The shooting began because contractors wanted to disperse the crowd, he said, but it was unclear why they continued shooting as people were walking away.\n\nThe camera does not show who was shooting or what was being shot at. But the contractor who filmed it said he watched another contractor fire at the Palestinians and then saw a man about 60 yards (meters) away  in the same direction where the bullets were fired  drop to the ground.\n\nThis happened at the same time the men were heard talking  effectively egging each other on, he said. In other videos furnished by the contractor, men in grey uniforms  colleagues, he said  can be seen trying to clear Palestinians who are squeezed into a narrow, fenced-in passage leading to one of the centers. The men fire pepper spray and throw stun grenades that detonate amid the crowd. The sound of gunfire can be heard. The contractor who took the video said the security personnel usually fire at the ground near the crowds or from nearby towers over their heads.\n\nDuring a single distribution in June, contractors used 37 stun grenades, 27 rubber-and-smoke scat shell projectiles and 60 cans of pepper spray, according to internal text communications shared with the AP.\n\nThat count does not include live ammunition, the contractor who provided the videos said.\n\nOne photo shared by that contractor shows a woman lying in a donkey cart after he said she was hit in the head with part of a stun grenade.\n\nAn internal report by Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF to run the sites, found that aid seekers were injured during 31% of the distributions that took place in a two-week period in June. The report did not specify the number of injuries or the cause. SRS told the AP the report refers to non-serious injuries.\n\nMore videos show frenzied scenes of Palestinians running to collect leftover food boxes at one site. Hundreds of young men crowd near low metal barriers, transferring food from boxes to bags while contractors on the other side of the barriers tell them to stay back.\n\nSome Palestinians wince and cough from pepper spray. You tasting that pepper spray? Yuck, one man close to the camera can be heard saying in English.\n\nSRS acknowledged that its dealing with large, hungry populations, but said the environment is secure, controlled, and ensures people can get the aid they need safely."

        "content": "Its been a turbulent stretch for McDonalds, with public health scandals, policy reversals  and now, a boycott.\n\nLast fall, the fast-food giant landed in hot water after a deadly E. coli outbreak was traced back to fresh, slivered onions served on its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. As a result, McDonalds suffered from significant declines in sales and customer visits, forcing the company to do damage control by launching a new Chicken Big Mac, providing more than $60 million to franchisees in affected states and spending an additional $35 million on marketing to promote deals such as its $5 value meal.\n\nThen, in January, McDonalds made the decision to scale back some of its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, following in the footsteps of several corporations that rolled back their programs in the wake of Donald Trumps election. The company said its retiring its specific diversity goals, including pausing external surveys that measure corporate diversity and requiring suppliers to commit to certain DEI pledges. McDonalds also changed the name of its diversity team to the Global Inclusion Team.\n\nIn the wake of its recent headlines, McDonalds has now become the target of an ongoing boycott initiated by The Peoples Union USA, a grassroots advocacy group. The unions founder, John Schwarz, explained in an Instagram post that the union is demanding fair taxes, an end to price gouging, real equality, and corporate accountability.\n\nThe boycott began on June 24 and is expected to continue until next Monday, June 30.\n\nThis is about more than burgers and fries, this is about power, The Peoples Union USA wrote on Instagram. When we unite and hit corporations in their wallets, they listenThis is a show of strength, solidarity and people powered change. Let them feel it. Let them hear us.\n\nEarlier this month, Schwarz provided a list of reasons for the boycott, saying McDonalds is guilty of exploiting tax loopholes, engaging in price gouging while wages stay low, suppressing workers rights and union efforts, supporting political figures who threaten democracy, practicing performative DEI with no meaningful change and prioritizing profit over people, community and truth.\n\nSchwarz isnt alone in his criticisms of the fast-food chain. Last October, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Ron Wyden of Oregon slammed McDonalds for substantially hiking up menu prices.\n\nEarlier this year, McDonalds USA President Joe Erlinger tried to blame the companys menu price increases on inflationary pressures and input costs, but the data tells another story, read a letter written by the three senators and addressed to the companys corporate leadership. McDonalds operating profit margins were 52% in the same year, the highest of the ten largest publicly traded fast food companies.\n\nWant more great food writing and recipes? Sign up for Salons free food newsletter, The Bite.\n\nCorporate profits must not come at the expense of peoples ability to put food on the table, the letter added.\n\nIn statements to NBC News, Casey further accused McDonalds of textbook greedflation, and Warren said McDonalds is squeezing customers to make massive profits, paying out billions to wealthy shareholders, and then turning around and blaming inflation for high costs.\n\nAs for whether the ongoing McDonalds boycott will have a significant impact remains unclear at this time. The Peoples Union USA previously called for boycotts of other major corporations, including Amazon, Nestl, Walmart, General Mills and Target.\n\nThe truth is, McDonalds built a global empire off low-wage labor, clever accounting, and aggressive lobbying, Schwarz told Newsweek. They report record profits, nearly $9 billion this year, while many of their workers still cant afford basic healthcare or rent. Thats not opportunity. Thats exploitation dressed up as service. This boycott isnt about fast food. Its about accountability. The Peoples Union USA stands for the growing number of Americans done tolerating corporate greed, inequality, and empty promises.\n\nIn response to the boycott, McDonalds told Newsweek, We welcome honest dialogue with the communities we serve, but were disappointed to see these misleading claims that distort our values and misrepresent our actions. Our focus remains on serving our customers and communities. Were here and ready to serve.\n\nMcDonalds issued a similar statement to CNN, saying, The McDonalds System also generates billions in federal, state and local taxes annually, and well continue to pay our fair share."

        "content": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti  Haitis once-illustrious Grand Htel Oloffson, a beloved Gothic gingerbread home that inspired books, hosted parties until dawn and attracted visitors from Mick Jagger to Haitian presidents, was burned down by gangs this past weekend.\n\nHundreds of Haitians and foreigners mourned the news as it spread across social media, with the hotel manager on Monday confirming the fire on X. Even though gang violence had forced the hotel in Haitis capital, Port-au-Prince, to close in recent years, many had hoped it would reopen.\n\nIt birthed so much culture and expression, said Riva Prcil, a Haitian-American singer who lived in the hotel from age 5 to 15. In a tearful phone interview, Prcil recalled how she learned to swim, dance and sing at the Oloffson.\n\nLongtime hotel manager Richard Morse, who had been overseeing the property remotely from the United States since the hotels closure in 2022, told The Associated Press on Monday that for several months, there were persistent rumors that the hotel had burned.\n\nSo when I heard Sunday morning that it burned, I did what I usually do, which is call someone who has drones and have them go take a look, he said. This time, when they called back, they said something like, take a seat. I knew then that this wasnt like the other times.\n\nThe attack on the community where the hotel was located began late Saturday, according to James Jean-Louis, who lives in the hills above the Oloffson. He told The Associated Press over the phone on Sunday that he observed the flames as he and other residents were chased out while police and gangs exchanged heavy gunfire.\n\nJournalists are currently unable to visit the site and verify the damage at the hotel because gangs control the area, which remains inaccessible. Patrick Durandis, director of the Institute for Safeguarding National Heritage, also confirmed the fire in a message to the AP.\n\nAmong those lamenting the fire was Michael Deibert, author of Notes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti, and Haiti Will Not Perish: A Recent History.\n\nHe landed in Miami on Sunday only to open his phone and see a flurry of messages from friends in Haiti.\n\nWhen you went to the Oloffson, you really felt you were being connected with Haitis political and cultural history, he said. You went to Haiti and were never the same. And the Oloffson really captured that.\n\nThe hotel attracted artists, intellectuals and politicians from Haiti and beyond, including Jacqueline Onassis and Tennessee Williams. It also survived coups, dictatorships and the devastating 2010 earthquake.\n\nIsabelle Morse, daughter of Richard Morse, said he loved having writers, photographers and other artists at the Oloffson.\n\nHis sense of community was very important to him, she said in a phone interview Monday, describing the hotel as his whole life.\n\nFor him, it represented freedom, where people from all walks of life could come in and share that space, she said.\n\nRichard Morse said he was reluctant to talk about what happened to the hotel given that in Haiti so many people are dying and being raped and losing everything that I dont want the focus to be on the hotel.\n\nMorse spent nearly 30 years at the Oloffson. Its where he met his wife, had his children and started his band, RAM.\n\nTheres no life without hope, so we have to consider bringing Haiti back and bringing the hotel back and bringing the art and the culture back, he said.\n\nIsabelle Morse said her parents had hoped to reopen the Oloffson.\n\nIts not only a business, its our home. We were raised there, she said. It was more about moving back home rather than reopening the business.\n\nThe Oloffson served as a presidential summer palace in the early 1900s and then became a U.S. Marine Corps Hospital before a Swedish sea captain converted it into a hotel in the 1930s.\n\nIt also served as inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greenes 1966 novel The Comedians, set in Haiti under the brutal dictatorship of Francois Duvalier, best known as Papa Doc.\n\nIn real life, tourism dwindled under the Duvaliers, and the hotel became a respite for aid workers and foreign correspondents.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Richard Morse became the hotels manager. His band, RAM, played Haitian roots music on Thursday nights that became legendary, as were the Day of the Dead celebrations known as Ft Gede that drew in Vodou practitioners.\n\nIt was a vessel for so many people to gather and freely express themselves, Prcil recalled. RAM really created that culture and that environment, made it a space that welcomed people from all types of denominations and sexual preferences.\n\nThe Oloffson was nestled in the upscale community of Pacot in the southeast corner of the countrys capital. It was surrounded by lush gardens and often described as a mythical place, renowned for its intricate latticework, turrets and spires and creaking parquet floors that characterize Haitis endangered gingerbread homes.\n\nA 1940s advertisement by Haitis tourism department said that the hotel was situated in the coolest section of the town and noted that English, French, German and Spanish were spoken there.\n\nThe hotel closed in recent years as gangs began raiding and seizing control of once peaceful communities.\n\nA lot of Haitis architectural heritage is going up in flames right now with so-called leaders stand by with their hands in their pockets, Deibert said. The destruction of the Oloffson is symbolic of the destruction of Haitis history and culture that weve been watching over the last several years."

        "content": "Shiploads of Minis, Aston Martins and Range Rovers will set sail for the US on Monday as the UK-US trade deal kicks in, but British farmers say they have been used as collateral to save the car industry.\n\nAuto shipments across the Atlantic were down more than half in May after Donald Trumps imposition of a 25% tariff on 3 April on top of an existing 2.5% levy.\n\nHowever, as of one minute past midnight US time on Monday  5am in the UK  that has been reduced to 10% for cars, and UK manufacturers expect pent-up demand to be unleashed.\n\nAston Martins chief executive, Adrian Hallmark, said the luxury carmaker had stopped shipping between April and June, something he said had been not catastrophic, but slightly uncomfortable.\n\nThe outline of the trade deal was agreed between Trump and Keir Starmer in early May, the first such bilateral pact to mitigate the presidents import taxes. However, delays in agreeing the fine print meant the higher tariff had continued to apply, pushing the cost of British cars up by more than a quarter for US importers.\n\nHallmark told a British car industry conference last week that he was planning to invoice three months worth of sales in a 24-hour period, with stocks in the US down by 50% due to the pause.\n\nAston Martin exports 90% of its cars, but its customers are wealthy and were willing to wait. The demand has been strong and will be in good shape when we start to invoice cars like fury on Monday next week, he said.\n\nOn the eve of the trade deal coming into force, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, received reassurances from the sportscar maker Lotus that it had no plans to close its UK factory, in Hethel, Norfolk.\n\nReynolds contacted Lotus bosses after it emerged that the carmaker was considering shifting production to the US  a move that would jeopardise 1,300 jobs.\n\nA Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said Reynolds met Lotus and its owner, Geely, on Sunday to clarify the companys situation, and was reassured by management that they are committed to their UK operations and have no plans to close their Hethel plant.\n\nA decision to relocate manufacturing abroad by a prestige brand such as Lotus would be embarrassing for the UK government. Labours industrial strategy, published last week, singled out automotive production as among the strategic sectors it wants to support.\n\nThe car industry welcomed the US-UK trade deal when it was struck, with it preventing job losses at JLR, the maker of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands. Range Rovers are particularly popular in the US.\n\nHowever, the lower 10% duty only applies to a quota of 100,000 cars a year  slightly below last years export numbers  leaving little room for growth. JLR alone exported 84,000 cars in the year up to April 2025.\n\nThe initial trade deal also included a promise of zero tariffs on steel but this has been held up by negotiations over the origin of some raw materials for smelting, particularly at Tatas plant at Port Talbot in south Wales.\n\nConcessions were won with new tariff-free quotas for British and US beef in each others markets, as well the controversial removal of a 19% tariff on American ethanol imports, which the UK industry says leaves biofuel plants facing closure.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day  we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At some point theyve got to stop relying on agriculture to take the burden, Bradshaw said. Agriculture has nothing left to give.\n\nOn the upside for farmers, they can now sell 13,000 tonnes of British beef to the US, but again there is a catch. They will not be able to sell until January next year because beef is part of a wider tariff deal with other countries, and this years quota has already been filled by Brazilians who stockpile beef in storage near the Mexican border.\n\nThe UK steel industry has at least won a temporary exemption from the 50% tariff imposed by Trump at the start of this month until 9 July, but it still faces a 25% tariff on exports. It is waiting anxiously for delivery of the promised zero rate tariff.\n\nTime is running out to secure a UK-US steel deal and remove damaging tariffs, said Gareth Stace, the director general of UK Steel.\n\nEvery day of delay costs our steelmakers dearly. Contracts are being lost, investment decisions remain on hold, and uncertainty is paralysing business decisions. We urgently need a swift, positive resolution to these talks to protect jobs, unlock growth, and restore confidence in the sector.\n\nYet even in a zero-tariff deal, Port Talbot may still face issues. The UK operations of the Indian conglomerate are relying on imports of steel melted and poured in its sister plants in India and the Netherlands while they move from a polluting blast furnace to the greener electric arc furnace to smelt steel.\n\nHowever, UK Steel is hoping there can be an exception to the tariffs agreed for the Welsh operation along with the five other plants in the UK. UK trade officials are understood to be optimistic they can secure such an exemption."

        "content": "Checking in on LA six months after the fires\n\nSix months after the fires that wiped out thousands of homes and structures in Los Angeles, where is the city in terms of recovery? Some personal stories reflect the challenges individuals are facing.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nIt's been six months to the day since the Los Angeles wildfires ignited and then went on to destroy thousands of homes and businesses, mostly in the communities of Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Erin Stone with member station LAist has been reporting on the recovery process and the challenges people are still facing. Hi there, Erin.\n\nERIN STONE, BYLINE: Hi.\n\nKELLY: Hi. So paint us a picture. When you go out, drive through these neighborhoods, what do you see at this point?\n\nSTONE: Well, instead of January's landscape of chimneys and staircases rising up from these piles of rubble, there are empty dirt lots block after block. That's because by now, the Army Corps of Engineers has cleared debris from most of the properties that burned, and they expect it to be fully done by midsummer. Now, that is really quick progress, but when it comes to where people are at emotionally and logistically, with all the paperwork they have to fill out to get insurance coverage, it's a really different story. Many survivors are still just at the beginning of recovery.\n\nKELLY: The beginning of recovery - what does that look like? What are the biggest challenges people are facing?\n\nSTONE: I would say insurance and lack of it. My colleague Libby Rainey and I have been speaking with fire survivors and experts, and what we heard from folks who have already decided to rebuild is there's a big gap in how much their insurance will pay them and how much they need to cover the cost of rebuilding.\n\nDavid Russell, an insurance professor at California State University, Northridge, told me that is quite common. Rates for materials and labor tend to jump after disasters. And even though the coverage limit does usually rise with inflation, it does not rise with the surge in demand after a disaster. So there can still be this big gap. And Steve Gibson is one of the many survivors facing down this gap. He estimates he and his wife are more than $100,000 short of what they need to rebuild. And most survivors like Gibson are also still making the list of everything they lost to get it covered.\n\nSTEVE GIBSON: We all feel like it's the hardest thing in our lives. It's hard to remember. It's painful to remember.\n\nSTONE: Even for those whose homes survived the fires, many still have not moved back in. That's because their insurers have yet to pay for cleaning smoke and other toxins. Meanwhile, renters are dealing with a brutal housing market. According to LA County data, right now, hundreds of displaced renters are still in temporary and insecure housing.\n\nKELLY: Well, and I'm listening to you and thinking, insurance, paperwork and bureaucracy is a hassle at the best of times, which this is not. These survivors you're talking to have just gone through something incredibly traumatic. What are people telling you about where they are emotionally?\n\nSTONE: Yeah, exactly, Mary Louise. The emotional trauma is still really, really fresh. Here's Robin Hughes, who lost her home in Altadena.\n\nROBIN HUGHES: It is ever-present, so it does feel like it just happened yesterday. Like, the passage of time is so muddled.\n\nSTONE: Most survivors I've spoken with feel similarly - that the trauma of the fires continues to lurk behind every conversation, every task they have to do in their daily lives.\n\nKELLY: Before I let you go, Erin, just let's go back to the why - to the stage of the investigations and to what actually caused these fires in the first place. What do we know?\n\nSTONE: Yeah, the investigations for both the Eaton and Palisades fires are still ongoing. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the investigation for what caused the Palisades Fire, and they turned down my request to share their preliminary findings so far. As for the Eaton Fire, according to statements that the local utility has made, their electrical equipment may have started it. Southern California Edison's CEO Pedro Pizarro has said publicly that there is evidence that seems to support the theory that an idle transmission line somehow got reenergized and potentially sparked the Eaton Fire. The LA County Fire Department, along with the state, are leading that investigation.\n\nKELLY: Reporting there from Erin Stone, with member station LAist. Thank you, Erin.\n\nSTONE: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "content": "Pope Leo's scandal-plagued hometown sees a bright future in buying his childhood home\n\ntoggle caption Raymond Boyd/Getty Images\n\nThe Chicago suburb where Pope Leo grew up plans to purchase his childhood home and turn it into a historic site.\n\nThe Board of Trustees of Dolton, Ill., voted unanimously on Tuesday to put an offer on the three-bedroom, three-bath brick house, which is up for auction later this month.\n\nAt the meeting  which was livestreamed online  Mayor Jason House called the purchase a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" for the village, which in recent years has been plagued by a series of scandals over alleged financial and political misconduct by its previous mayor.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We can either seize this moment and move it forward, or we can let that moment go to an investor,\" House said.\n\nThe May election of Pope Leo  the first American-born pope  has drawn national attention to Dolton, a village with an estimated population around 20,000 some 20 miles south of Chicago.\n\nLeo  then known as Robert Prevost  grew up in the home on East 141st Place. His parents bought it new in 1949, paying a $42 monthly mortgage, according to member station WBEZ.\n\nPrevost moved away for college and spent most of his career in Peru before rising through the Vatican ranks. His family sold the house in 1996, and ownership changed multiple times in the years since. Most recently, a local bought it as a flip property in 2024 and had been trying to sell it earlier this year  as the Roman Catholic Church was undergoing a seismic change in leadership.\n\nAccording to WBEZ, the house was listed for $219,000 on May 5, just days after Pope Francis' death and before the start of the papal conclave. But the listing was taken down by the time Leo emerged as the new pontiff.\n\nBroker iCandy Realty and real estate auction firm Paramount Realty are offering it to the highest bidder by July 17, with a reserve price of $250,000  the minimum the seller will accept. They say it was renovated in 2025, but remains a part of history.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Pope Leo XIV's journey from this humble neighborhood to the Vatican is a testament to faith, perseverance, and purpose,\" its informational brochure reads. \"Now, you have the rare chance to own a tangible piece of his inspiring legacy.\"\n\nNeither village authorities, the realtor or the auction firm involved have responded to NPR's requests for comment about what Tuesday's vote might mean for the property's sale and future.\n\nSome locals don't see the house as a top priority\n\nWhile the unanimous motion drew a smattering of applause in the room, not everyone is thrilled about this use of village funds.\n\nDolton has been plagued by financial and political scandals since well before the new pope put it on the map.\n\nIts previous mayor, Tiffany Henyard, is the subject of multiple lawsuits and a federal investigation over alleged corruption, financial mismanagement and political retaliation during her four-year tenure.\n\nResidents voted to recall her in 2022, but an appeals court later ruled that election invalid. In 2024, the Board of Trustees hired former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to investigate Henyard's conduct.\n\nLightfoot shared the results in January, outlining a pattern of unchecked spending and deception by Henyard. One of her findings was that Dolton's general fund balance had dropped from a surplus in 2022 to around $3.65 million in debt.\n\nHenyard's attorney accused Lightfoot of \"political theater\" in an effort to thwart her re-election campaign, which was unsuccessful. House beat her in the Democratic primary with 88% of the vote and was sworn in in May. And while Henyard's legal troubles continue, House has pledged to get the village back on track.\n\nHis priorities include rebuilding trust between the local government and residents, as well as bringing new businesses to the area.\n\nIt's against this backdrop that several concerned citizens came forward on Tuesday to question the house purchase, saying they would rather see an investment in basic infrastructure improvements, like fixing roads and filling potholes.\n\n\"We need to be mindful of addressing the issues that the city has while we're trying to address the debts and the lawsuits,\" the Rev. Ryan Reese said from the crowd. \"I'm not sure that this is the first priority.\"\n\nAnother resident, Mary Avent, said that while buying the house is \"admirable,\" she worries about whether the village can afford it.\n\n\"Even if we have the money, who's going to maintain that?\" she asked.\n\nHouse said police and public works have been maintaining the property and will continue to do so.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We've had charters come in here, we want to make sure that anybody that comes into our community is safe,\" he said. \"That's a cost we will incur whether we own the property or not  Why would we not want to participate in that and get the benefit of this historic moment moving forward?\"\n\nHouse assured worried residents that the project will not derail from the board's other priorities, adding that some roads would be repaved within days.\n\nOfficials hope history can fund the future\n\nHouse said he wants the community to benefit from its history, and spoke of opportunities to get state and federal funds to do so. He stressed that attracting visitors would create much-needed revenue for the village, saying \"you cannot cut your way out of a deficit.\"\n\nSeveral board members compared the pope's house to the childhood homes of figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Michael Jackson, and the tourism opportunities it could create. The Jackson home in Gary, Ind., is unoccupied and owned by the family, while the King family sold two of MLK's Atlanta homes  where he was born, and where he later lived with his family  to the National Park Service within the last decade.\n\n\"When we do it the correct way, in the long run, it will pay for itself,\" trustee Tammie Brown said, adding that she's already heard from supporters of the idea who want to donate.\n\nSince May, camera crews and Catholic tourists have traveled from across the country to visit and take pictures outside of the two-story house (although some mistakenly flocked to the wrong one), according to local media reports.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Village of Dolton posted photos to its Facebook page of workers repairing the building's roof. It said the house continues to attract visitors, \"bringing new energy and attention to our village.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"This increased traffic represents a new day in Dolton  full of potential, progress, and promise,\" it said."

        "content": "In August, fellow reporter Jason Patinkin and I crossed on foot from northern Uganda into rebel-held South Sudan. Over the course of four days, we walked more than 40 miles through the bush, escorted by rebel soldiers, to shed light on one of the worlds most underreported conflicts.\n\nReporting on South Sudans war, which began in 2013, has always been a challenge due to the risk and logistical hurdles associated with accessing remote areas where fighting takes place. But over the past year, covering the war and its humanitarian fallout has become particularly difficult. Since the beginning of this year, South Sudans government has banned at least 20 foreign journalists in an apparent effort to silence reporters who had a track record of critically reporting on the government.\n\nThis systematic crackdown on the foreign press (South Sudanese journalists have long risked imprisonment and death for doing their work) coincided with two important developments. In November 2016, the United Nations warned that the violence being committed against civilians in the southern region of Equatoria risked spiraling into genocide. Then, in February, the UN declared a man-made famine, warning that 100,000 people were at risk of starving to death as a result of civil war.\n\nJournalists seeking to cover these events were left with two equally unsavory options: self-censorship or a risky trip to rebel-held parts of the country. Only a handful of journalists have attempted the latter since fighting escalated in July last year. For us, this was our second embed with the rebels this year.\n\nWe set off from a town in northern Uganda at five in the morning, bouncing along a bumpy dirt track towards the South Sudan border. Crammed into our four-wheel drive were rebel commander Martin Abucha, a dual American and South Sudanese citizen who we planned to profile for our PBS NewsHour Weekend segment, a couple of guides, and several duffle bags stuffed with our tents, sleeping bags, emergency medical kits and provisions to last us four days.\n\nJust as the sun began to rise above a distant range of hills that we aimed to cross later that day, our car came to a halt in front of a stream. Because of the rainy reason, it carried more water than usual. It was time to disembark and start walking, or footing, as South Sudanese tend to call it.\n\nWe took off our shoes and waded through the streams chilly waters. This was the first of a many rivers wed have to cross along the way, either on foot or in small flimsy canoes dug out from tree trunks. Each time, we dreaded the idea of falling in with our camera gear.\n\nThe war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media.\n\nThe first part of our journey in northern Uganda felt very much like a hike through a national park. Passing beautiful landscapes and idyllic farming villages, one could almost forget we were headed into a war zone  but we were about to get a reality check.\n\nWe had just crossed into South Sudan when out of nowhere, two dozen armed men popped out of the tall grass and surrounded us at gunpoint.\n\nStop! Who are you and where are you going, a soldier called out in Juba Arabic from his hideout no more than 20 yards away, pointing his AK47 at us. Another one next to him had a rocket-propelled grenade propped on his shoulder, also unequivocally aiming it in our direction.\n\nInstinctively, we threw our hands in the air and exchanged a baffled glance. Had we accidentally bumped into government soldiers? Or perhaps we had come onto the wrong rebels? Abuchas group, called the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army In Opposition, is the biggest but not the only armed group in Equatoria, an area rife with rival militia and bandits who exploit the security vacuum left by war.\n\nTo our relief, and only after Abucha answered a series of questions, this routine security check quickly gave way to a warm welcome. The platoon would be our escort for the next four days as we trekked to their base and to Loa, Abuchas hometown.\n\nKeeping up with the rebels was no easy task. Given the countrys pervasive lack of basic infrastructure, South Sudanese grow up walking for dozens of miles just to go about their daily lives. For sedentary Westerners, keeping the target pace of two meters per second (around five miles an hour) proved challenging amid 90-degree temperatures, all while filming and plowing our way through dense, itchy elephant grass.\n\nThe upside of the cumbersome terrain was that it kept us safe. During our four-day trip, we didnt cross a single road, instead walking along a dizzying network of narrow bush paths the rebels seemed to know like the backs of their hands. An unwanted encounter with government troops, who tended to stick to roads and move around in vehicles as opposed to on foot, was highly unlikely.\n\nThe closest we got to government-controlled area was a visit to Loa, located just two kilometers away from a main road frequently patrolled by government soldiers. We couldnt stay long, but the hour we spent on the ground offered us a glimpse into what villages must look like in many parts of Equatoria: burned mud huts, looted schools and clinics, fallow fields and  most strikingly  no civilians.\n\nThe war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities like the one in Loa, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. Our four-day venture into rebel-held South Sudan offered us a rare opportunity to report ground truths, and we are thankful for that."

Speaking alongside defense secretary Pete Hegseth and homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, Rollins said the administration would pursue executive actions and work with states to halt such purchases, citing national security and food security concerns. No longer can foreign adversaries assume were not watching, Hegseth said, adding that the Pentagon would block farmland sales near military installations to protect food supplies for troops especially in a contingency. The move includes plans for increased monitoring of existing farmland owned by entities from China, Russia and Iran. Chinese investors currently control 265,000 acres of US land, according to government data, with roughly half connected to Smithfield Foods, which was bought by Chinese conglomerate WH Group in 2013. Chinese ownership of US farmland has already fallen significantly, dropping from 384,000 acres in 2021 to current levels.

The ruling is yet another brush up between the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and the Republican-controlled legislature over LGBTQ+ rights. Evers has previously vetoed GOP bills targeting transgender high school athletes and has sought to limit the legislatures power. Conversion therapy is already banned in 23 states and Washington DC.

We do not support or condone any statement that politicizes tragedy, diminishes human dignity, or fails to clearly uphold compassion for every child and family, regardless of background or beliefs. Blue Fish Pediatrics statement neither named the physician in question nor specified whether she had resigned or was dismissed. But multiple publicly accessible social media posts identified her as Dr Christina Propst. A Guardian source familiar with the situation confirmed the accuracy of the posts naming Propst.

The lawsuit specifically takes aim at health secretary Robert F Kennedys unilateral decision to recommend against Covid-19 vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children. Kennedys announcement circumvented expert scientific review panels and flouted studies showing pregnant women are at heightened risk from the virus, and made it more difficult for some to get the vaccine. This administration is an existential threat to vaccination in America, and those in charge are only just getting started, said Richard H Hughes IV, partner at Epstein Becker Green and lead counsel for the plaintiffs in a statement. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians and American Public Health Association are among a list of leading physicians associations named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. If left unchecked, secretary Kennedy will accomplish his goal of ridding the United States of vaccines, which would unleash a wave of preventable harm on our nations children, said Hughes. The professional associations for pediatricians, internal medicine physicians, infectious disease physicians, high-risk pregnancy physicians, and public health professionals will not stand idly by as our system of prevention is dismantled. This ends now. In late May, Kennedy announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would no longer recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children or pregnant women. The announcement, made on social media, contradicted a raft of evidence showing pregnant women and infants are at especially high-risk from the disease, including from the administrations own scientific leaders. In June, Kennedy went further by firing all 17 sitting members of a key vaccine advisory panel to the CDC. The advisory panel is a key link in the vaccine distribution pipeline, helping to develop recommendations insurers use when determining which vaccines to cover. That panel met for the first time in late June. Members announced they would review both the childhood vaccine schedule and any vaccines that had not been formally reviewed in seven years. They also recommended against a long-vilified vaccine preservative, in spite of a lack of evidence of harm.

On Monday, Democrats asked a government watchdog to investigate whether cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) affected the forecasting agencys performance. But Republicans default response has been to express fealty to Donald Trump. They lavished praise on the president for providing federal assistance while studiously avoiding questions around the effect of his department of government efficiency (Doge) or threats to dismantle the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). It is a sign of the sickness and dysfunction of what was the Republican party that they have almost no thoughts about their constituents, said Rick Wilson, a cofounder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group. Their thoughts are, how do I avoid making sure that Donald Trump doesnt look at me as an enemy or a critic? Despite the fact that the Doge cuts and the reductions in force and the early buyouts have savaged the workforce of the National Weather Service, they cant even utter the slightest vague, elliptical critique of the administration that is now engaged in these cuts that have cost the lives of the people they supposedly represent. The raging flash floods  among the USs worst in decades  slammed into riverside camps and homes in central Texas before daybreak on Friday, pulling sleeping people out of their cabins, tents and trailers and dragging them for miles past floating tree trunks and cars. Some survivors were found clinging to trees. Authorities say the death toll is sure to rise as crews look for the many who are still missing.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would end temporary protected status (TPS) for an estimated 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans in moves that will come into effect in about 60 days. Citizens of the two Central American nations were accorded the status after Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which left 10,000 dead after it ripped through the region. Honduras and Nicaragua are the latest in a series of countries to have their US-based citizens stripped of temporary protections since Donald Trumps return to the White House. Similar moves have been made to end TPS for those from Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan, Cameroon and Nepal. Not all of those being stripped of the protection will necessarily be at risk of being forced to leave. Roughly 21,000 Hondurans and 1,100 Nicaraguans have obtained green cards, giving them legal permanent residence status. Those without such status will be urged to arrange their departure through a Customs and Border Protection app, which would offer complimentary plane tickets and a $1,000 exit bonus, according to Fox News.

The stockpile of the Patriot missiles has fallen so low that it raised concern inside the Pentagon that it could jeopardize potential US military operations, and deputy defense secretary, Stephen Feinberg, authorized the transfer to be halted while they reviewed where weapons were being sent. Donald Trump appeared to reverse at least part of that decision on Monday when he told reporters in advance of a dinner at the White House with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would send some more weapons to Ukraine, although he did not disclose whether that would include Patriot systems. Trump also told Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a phone call that he was not responsible for the halt in weapons shipments and that he had directed a review of US weapons stockpiles but didnt order the freeze, according to people briefed on the conversation. But the determination last month to halt the transfer, as described by four people directly familiar with the matter, was based in large part on the Pentagons global munitions tracker, which is used to generate the minimum level of munitions required to carry out the US militarys operations plans. According to the tracker, which is managed by the joint chiefs of staff and the Pentagons defense security cooperation agency, the stockpiles of a number of critical munitions have been below that floor for several years since the Biden administration started sending military aid to Ukraine.

The U.S. imports nearly half of the copper it uses, most of which comes from Chile, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nA man works with copper at El Teniente mine, reportedly the world's largest underground copper mine, in Machali, Chile, in April. Raul Bravo / AFP - Getty Images\n\nTrump in late February ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on copper imports on national security grounds.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CNBCs Power Lunch later Tuesday that that investigation was finished.\n\nThe idea is to bring copper home, bring copper production home, Lutnick said. He noted that Trumps move will bring copper tariffs in line with U.S. duties on imports of steel and aluminum, which Trump doubled to 50% in early June.\n\nLutnick said he expected Trump to soon sign a proclamation that would put the copper tariff in place by the end of July.\n\nThe new trade announcements on copper and pharmaceuticals are separate from the reciprocal tariffs that Trump unveiled in early April, when he imposed a baseline 10% duty on imports from nearly all other countries, as well as much higher rates on dozens of individual nations.\n\nTrump has repeatedly delayed the higher reciprocal tariffs from taking effect. But on Monday, he sent out a spate of letters dictating new tariff rates on imports from 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand.\n\nThose individualized blanket tariff rates, which ranged from 25% to 40%, are set to take effect Aug. 1.\n\n CNBCs Spencer Kimball contributed to this report."

        "content": "He was an uncommonly dangerous man, in the FBIs eyes, a combat-toughened killer who had returned from Vietnam to wage war on the Establishment.\n\nWe are going to drive the pigs out of the community, Elmer Geronimo Pratt, the 21-year-old leader of the Black Panther Party in Los Angeles, told a reporter in 1970.\n\nPratt was stout, compact and level-eyed, with a raspy drawl bespeaking his childhood on the Louisiana bayou. He envisioned a violent end at the hands of police, whom he cast as an occupying army in African American neighborhoods. The next time you see me, I might be dead.\n\nWhen he went on trial in 1972  on charges he murdered a white schoolteacher, execution-style, during a robbery  he insisted he was being framed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis defense attorney, a young Johnnie Cochran Jr., initially dismissed Pratts talk as paranoia. But Cochran would later describe the case as a twilight zone of deceit, dishonesty, betrayal and official corruption.\n\nPratts conviction kept him behind bars for 27 years, and the case haunted Cochran, who believed Pratt was innocent and who had made a mistake at trial that prosecutors skillfully exploited. In the authorities war against perceived subversives, it would be years before it became clear how brazenly they had cheated.\n\nAttorney Johnnie Cochran, left, would describe Pratts murder prosecution as a twilight zone of deceit, dishonesty, betrayal and official corruption. (Jim Ruymen / Pool photo)\n\nIt looked on the surface like a really straightforward murder case, said Stuart Hanlon, now 76, the radical San Francisco defense attorney who took up Pratts appeal as a law student and pursued it doggedly for decades.\n\nThe victim was Caroline Olsen, 27, who was with her husband on a Santa Monica tennis court in December 1968 when a pair of gunmen approached demanding money. The men ordered the couple to lie face down, then began opening fire. She was fatally wounded; her husband was struck but survived. The robbers got $18.\n\nThe investigation stalled, and Pratt was not a suspect until 1970, when Julius Julio Butler, a beautician and former police officer, implicated him. Butler had been a Panther himself, and had resented Pratts elevation as Los Angeles leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this series, Christopher Goffard revisits old crimes in Los Angeles and beyond, from the famous to the forgotten, the consequential to the obscure, diving into archives and the memories of those who were there. Read the stories\n\nThe states star witness, Butler testified that Pratt had dropped by his beauty shop and announced he was going on a mission and later pointed to an article about the Santa Monica shooting to confirm it was his doing.\n\nCochran asked Butler if he had ever been a police informant. Butler flatly denied it.\n\nDevastatingly for the defense, Olsens widower pointed to the defendant and said: Thats the man who murdered my wife.\n\nCochran argued against the reliability of cross-racial witness identification, particularly under conditions of stress, and put on the stand a witness who had seen Pratt in the Bay Area around the time of the killing. He also put on Pratt, who had been decorated for heroism during two tours in Vietnam with the Army, and who showed what Cochran called a soldiers contempt for whomever shot the helpless Olsen in the back.\n\nAt a 1996 news conference in Los Angeles, Cochran and other attorneys call for a new trial for Pratt. (Nick Ut / Associated Press)\n\nCochran thought it was a winnable case, but he introduced an exhibit that backfired terribly. It was a Polaroid, given to him by Pratts brother, who insisted it had been taken a week after the shooting. It showed Pratt with a beard, which contradicted the widowers initial description of the shooter as a clean-shaven black man.\n\nProsecutors countered with a Polaroid employee who said the film had not even been manufactured until five months after the crime, a blow to the defenses credibility that left jurors doubting Pratts other claims.\n\nIt took jurors 10 days to find him guilty of first-degree murder. The sentence was 25 years to life. Youre wrong. I didnt kill that woman, Pratt erupted. You racist dogs.\n\nPratt spent the next eight years in solitary confinement. He was shuttled among prisons, and eventually allowed conjugal visits; his wife gave birth to two children. At a series of unsuccessful parole hearings, the panel waited for him to say he was sorry. He insisted he hadnt done it.\n\nThe last person I killed, he would say, was in Vietnam.\n\nSupporters of Pratt rally for his release outside a Los Angeles courthouse in April 1996. (Susan Sterner / Associated Press)\n\nThere was much the authorities had not shared with Pratts defense team. They did not reveal that Olsens widower had previously identified another man as the shooter. (The man had been in jail at the time and could not have done it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNor did they reveal the scope of the star witness work as an informant for law enforcement officials. Based on FBI documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Pratts lawyers pieced together a picture of Butlers intimate involvement with the FBI, the Los Angeles Police Department and the L.A. County district attorneys office in dozens of cases.\n\nTo FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the Panthers had been the most dangerous group in the country, homegrown terrorists with stockpiles of weapons and alarming Maoist rhetoric. His secret COINTELPRO program was a campaign of spying, wiretaps and sabotage aimed at crushing perceived subversives and thwarting the coalition of militant black nationalist groups.\n\nGeronimo was targeted by the FBI because he was a natural leader, Hanlon said.\n\nAs Hanlon pieced together documents, it became clear that Butler had been helping. Rejecting appeal after appeal, however, courts ruled that Butler had not been an informant  he had been a contact and nothing more, according to one judge  and that Pratt did not deserve a new trial.\n\nHe was still considered dangerous. If he chooses to set up a revolutionary organization upon his release from prison, it would certainly be easy for him to do so, a prosecutor said at one parole hearing. He does have this network out there.\n\nWhen defense lawyers brought their evidence to then-L.A. County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti in 1993, they presented it as a chance to undo the injustice his predecessors had sanctioned two decades earlier. But Garcettis review dragged on for years, and the attorneys turned again to the courts.\n\nHe was more likely framed than he was the person who actually committed the crime, former L.A. County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said recently of Pratt. (Ken Lubas / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThis time, the courts granted a hearing. Because the L.A. County Superior Court bench was recused  the original prosecutor was now an L.A. County judge and a probable witness  the case was transferred to Orange County Superior Court. For Pratts supporters, this provoked a chill. What hope did they have in a staunchly conservative county?\n\nBut Judge Everett Dickey surprised them.\n\nIts clear that this is not a typical case, Dickey said. It cries out for resolution.\n\nThis time, Pratts team was armed with evidence never heard at the original trial. They had the testimony of a retired FBI agent who supported Pratts claim that he had been in Oakland during the killing.\n\nThey knew that the D.A.s office had allowed Butler to plead no contest to four felonies in exchange for probation, around the time he testified against Pratt.\n\nAnd they had an index card, recently discovered by one of Garcettis investigators in the office files, that listed Butler as a D.A. informant. It was filed under B; it had been there all along.\n\nIt had never been turned over to the defense. How could they have not turned this over? Garcetti said in a recent interview. I couldnt find anyone who would fess up to the fact that, Yeah, we had that document in the files.\n\nStill, Garcettis prosecutors downplayed the cards importance. Butler was not an informant, they argued vehemently, but merely a source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late 1996, Cochran finally got a chance to confront Butler. He had waited years. Butler had become an attorney and an official at a prominent Los Angeles church. He insisted he had been merely a liaison between law enforcement and the Panthers.\n\nCochran asked him his definition of informant. He admitted he had told the FBI that Pratt had a submachine gun. He said his definition of an informant was someone who supplied accurate information.\n\nSo under your own definition, you were informing to the FBI? Cochran asked.\n\nYou could say that, Butler said.\n\nPratt beams after his release from an Orange County jail in June 1997. (Kim Kulish / Getty Images)\n\nDickey threw out Pratts conviction, concluding that Butler had lied and that prosecutors had hidden evidence that could have led to Pratts acquittal.\n\nPratt was released on bail in June 1997, to the cheers of his supporters.\n\nThe greatest moment of my legal career, Cochran called it.\n\nPratt flew home to Morgan City, La., to see my mama and my homefolks, he said. It wasnt easy getting here.\n\nHe said he wanted to hear rain on the tin roof of his childhood home.\n\nIf you have information on old crimes, famous, once-famous or obscure, contact christopher.goffard@latimes.com\n\nPratts legal ordeal was not over, however. Garcetti appealed, saying he had found no evidence pointing to Pratts innocence. He did not drop the case until an appeals court sided with Pratt in February 1999. The following year, Pratt won $4.5 million in a false-imprisonment lawsuit against the city of L.A. and the FBI. He bought a farmhouse in Imbaseni, Tanzania, where he enjoyed the companionship of Pete ONeal, a former Black Panther who had fled the U.S. in 1970.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nONeal found him dead at home in May 2011. Pratt had been hospitalized with high blood pressure, a condition that had plagued him for years, but had torn out his IVs and gone home. He hated confinement. He was 63.\n\nWe always say, The system works, but no, the system only produced the right result because Geronimo and the community and a band of lawyers fought the system. The system doesnt work by itself, said Mark Rosenbaum, one of the lawyers who helped with Pratts appeal. They took away half of his life. And they couldnt break him.\n\nSo, who killed Caroline Olsen? Hanlon believes the killers were other Black Panthers  a pair of heroin addicts known to feed their habit with armed robbery. They died violently in the 1970s, one by gunfire, the other impaled on a fence during a burglary.\n\nIn a recent interview, Garcetti, one of the defense teams primary antagonists for years, said that his views on the case have evolved. In retrospect, he regrets fighting to keep it alive.\n\nHe was more likely framed than he was the person who actually committed the crime, Garcetti said.\n\nSince leaving office, he said, he has learned more about the U.S. governments tactics against disfavored groups in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have read enough to know the FBI, from the top down, were working to isolate any quote-unquote leader in the Black Panther movement, and it wouldnt shock me to learn that they went after people who really hadnt committed a crime that they were bent on removing from the scene."

        "content": "If your exercise routine has hit a summer slump, it may be because your workouts arent suited to your personality, new research suggests.\n\nPersonality traits can influence which physical activities people enjoy, as well as how often and how much benefit they get from exercise, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.\n\nAbout 31% of adults fall short of the recommended 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity per week, highlighting the need for tailored exercise programs to get people motivated, scientists at University College London said.\n\nUnderstanding personality factors in designing and recommending physical activity programs is likely to be very important in determining how successful a program is, and whether people will stick with it and become fitter, senior author Paul Burgess, a professor at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, said in a news release.\n\nThe researchers recruited 132 adults, who underwent baseline fitness testing before they were split into two groups.\n\nFor eight weeks, one group was asked to follow a home fitness regimen that included strength training and cycling workouts of varying intensity. Those in the control group were provided with stretching exercises but otherwise continued their typical lifestyles.\n\nIts expected that introverts would gravitate toward solo workouts and extroverts would shine in group fitness classes, but the study showed some surprises.\n\nTo participate, the volunteers filled out questionnaires that measured the so-called Big Five personality traits:\n\nAgreeableness\n\nConscientiousness\n\nExtraversion\n\nNeuroticism\n\nOpenness\n\nThe more extroverted participants did enjoy high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts and aerobic fitness lab testing.\n\nHowever, people who scored high on extraversion were less likely to complete follow-up testing, so only 86 participants overall completed the study. In addition, extroverts didnt have greater fitness improvements.\n\nExtroverts often prefer team sports or group fitness classes, and they get energy from fellow exercisers, Dr. Blaise Aguirre, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Arlington, Massachusetts, said in an email. On the other hand, others who are more conscientious would be drawn to structured, schedule-based activities  say, a specific class at a gym where a specific and predictable routine is followed  and this is because this fits their organized, goal-oriented nature.\n\nPeople who scored higher on neuroticism  that is, a tendency to be moody or anxious  liked low-intensity exercise sessions at home as opposed to being supervised in the lab. They were also less likely to self-monitor their heart rates.\n\nPeople who are very anxious might avoid challenging forms of exercise or ones that involve others for fear of embarrassment, and because of this gravitate toward solo or less intense activities, wrote Aguirre, who wasnt involved in the study.\n\nAn important finding for people with anxiety: Participants with high neuroticism in the exercise group were the only ones who showed decreased stress, the authors noted.\n\nAt baseline, the participants who were more conscientious demonstrated better physical fitness and worked out more hours per week. That trait wasnt a predictor of how much someone enjoyed exercising, though.\n\nParticipants who scored high in openness were less likely to enjoy the HIIT workouts and threshold rides  or cycling to boost aerobic power  which involved varying intensities. But they were likelier to complete follow-up testing.\n\nPeople who are high in openness might be willing to experiment and seek out novel or varied routines, Aguirre said in email. For instance, if they typically go to the gym and like to jog, they may be open to trying dance, hiking or some new fitness trends.\n\nThe trait of agreeableness predicted more enjoyment of an easy, long bike ride, the study found.\n\nWhich workouts work for my personality?\n\nThe link between personality and physical activity goes both ways, Aguirre said.\n\nIn as much as your personality shapes your exercise routine, exercise can shape personality in return, in that it can also help reinforce positive traits (like being more disciplined and more sociable) and reduce negative ones (like anxiety or emotional instability), he said.\n\nWhether youre looking to refresh your exercise regimen or starting from scratch, Aguirre recommends keeping these tips in mind:\n\nKnow yourself and your nature.\n\nChoose activities that match your traits.\n\nStart small and build consistency.\n\nSeek support if needed.\n\nBe patient with yourself.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach, he said."

        "content": "WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security will terminate deportation protections for thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans living in the United States, according to U.S. government notices posted Monday, part of President Donald Trumps broad effort to strip legal status from migrants.\n\nThe action, effective Sept. 6, will end Temporary Protected Status for an estimated 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans who have had access to the legal status since 1999, according to a pair of Federal Register notices.\n\nThe Republican president has sought to end temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of migrants in the United States, including some who have lived and worked in the country legally for decades. The Trump administration already had moved to end TPS for 348,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians, as well as thousands from Afghanistan and Cameroon.\n\nThe administration has said deportation protections were overused in the past and that many migrants no longer merit protections. Democrats and advocates for the migrants have said that TPS enrollees could be forced to return to dangerous conditions and that U.S. employers depend on their labor.\n\nTPS provides deportation relief and work permits to people already in the United States if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. During his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump sought to end most TPS enrollment, including the designations covering Honduras and Nicaragua, but his attempts were blocked by federal courts as unlawful.\n\nThe initial TPS designations for Honduras and Nicaragua were based on destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch, which tore through Central America in 1998 and killed at least 10,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in the termination notices that the countries had made significant recoveries, citing tourism in both countries, real estate investment in Honduras and the renewable energy sector in Nicaragua.\n\nTemporary Protected Status was designed to be just that  temporary, Noem said in a statement.\n\nDemocratic former President Joe Bidens administration renewed TPS for Honduras and Nicaragua in 2023, saying the effects of Hurricane Mitch still reverberated and that political instability, economic issues and damage from other storms warranted extending the protections.\n\nThe State Department currently warns Americans to reconsider travel to Honduras due to crime and to Nicaragua due to the risk of wrongful detention and limited health care, while also raising concerns about crime. The Honduran government issued a state of emergency in 2022 that allows police to suspend constitutional rights in much of the country. The United Nations has accused Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega of repression after new constitutional reforms in effect this year expanded his powers.\n\nAntonio Garcia, the Honduran deputy foreign minister, said the U.S. decision reflected Trumps broader effort to end TPS and was not targeting Hondurans specifically. It has happened to all countries ... and now us, Garcia said.\n\nWhile the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in May that the Trump administration could proceed with ending the status for Venezuelans, a federal judge last week blocked the termination for Haitians."

        "content": "Valerie Castile is a mother of the movement. She was thrust into that role after the July 6, 2016, killing of her son, Philando, by Jeronimo Yanez of the St. Anthony police department.\n\nLike Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, and U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath, the mother of Jordan Davis, Ms. Castile has since used her personal tragedy as a platform for advocacy and policy change.\n\nMs. Castile founded the Philando Castile Relief Foundation, not just in the spirit of her sons sense of philanthropy, but as a policy-shifting mechanism in Minneapolis and across the country that can be described in three words: Feed the children.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Nine years ago, Valerie Castile lost her son, Philando, at a traffic stop gone horribly wrong. She is determined that his life will not be forgotten. His legacy can be summed up in three words: Feed the children. Part of an occasional series.\n\nMr. Castile had a reputation of making sure no child was hungry under his purview. The standard he set during his time at J.J. Hill Montessori School was maximized statewide through his posthumous foundation. Ms. Castiles donations toward removing student lunch debt  clocking in at more than $200,000  inspired Minnesota to become the fourth state to pass a free breakfast and lunch program at all public schools in 2023. Other efforts include a memorial scholarship and holiday giveaways.\n\nWhatever I do, I have the community in mind. I want my people treated with the same respect and dignity that you give other people, says Ms. Castile. Thats the warrior spirit, and its embedded in all of us. But there are certain things that may happen to you in life to bring that spirit forward.\n\nThat sense of reflection has grown into a series of memorials and reminders, one of which is the Philando Castile Peace Garden, adorned with African Adinkra symbols, at the site of his death. On July 6, there was a Restoration Day and candlelight vigil. It will be followed by a community cookout on July 7, on what is called Unity Day.\n\nThe garden is a place of self-reflection and to come to your own conclusions about your life and what you can do to improve the community, she says.\n\nI wanted my son to have a chance\n\nIn a room in her home full of mementos of her son, she talks about a nickname that suggests her sense of leadership predated her sons death.\n\nMy mother called me Valerie.  But my father called me Captain, Ms. Castile says, surrounded by paintings and proclamations in a place she says is Phils Room. He called me that because I had a lot of friends [growing up] and they would come to the house with me. He called them my scurvy crew.\n\nShe laughs and smiles wide at the memory of her father. It is a smile similar to Philandos, despite her insistence that her son looks like his dad down to his teeth. It is also a grin that belies her hard upbringing in St. Louis.\n\nMy parents were living in what they called Cochran [Gardens] in downtown St. Louis. It was a project.  We grew up in poverty, she says as she straightens her back. Everything was brick. Even the playgrounds were brick. No such thing as dirt and grass.\n\nEvery project was concrete. They just threw down concrete and stacked Negroes on top of themselves.\n\nAs one of six children, Ms. Castiles sense of community and family was forged out of necessity. She and her family lived on the 11th floor.\n\nThe [project] only went up to 11. Mind you, there were two elevators, and they were always broken. If they werent broke, they stunk, she says with a laugh. When my mom went to the grocery store, we had a system. ... One of us would have to walk from the first to the third floor, then hand the bags to someone going from the third to the sixth floor. Someone would eventually come down to nine and take them up to the 11th.\n\nMs. Castiles father moved to Minnesota in the late 1960s, and whenever she visited him, she noticed a dramatic shift in the way of life. Minneapolis represented something different, and she vowed that whenever she had children, they would live there. She became pregnant at 26.\n\nI wanted my son to have a chance.  I wanted to have a fresh start, she says. Because in order for you to change your life, you have to change your environment. You have to change the people that you hang out with, regardless of who they are. You have to transition yourself.\n\nHes a miracle baby\n\nPhilando Divall Castile was born July 16, 1983, his name a reminder of the relationship between mother and son. Phil is a root of the Greek word philia, meaning friendship and affection.\n\nFrom the very beginning, he was a surprise. Hes a miracle baby, Ms. Castile said. Back before I got pregnant, I would go to the clinic, and they said I couldnt have kids. For me to get pregnant, I thought that was special within itself.\n\nHis birth changed everything for the Castiles. Mom got a job  two jobs  to make sure her son had everything he needed. Her daughter and Phils sister, Allysza, was born almost a decade later. And then, Phil wanted what so many kids wanted in 1996.\n\nA pair of Jordans.\n\nI said, I cant afford those shoes! Because when you get done wearing them, you cant eat em. You need a job, she recalls. I went to downtown Saint Paul and signed the paperwork [for him to work] right there at Selby Avenue.\n\nHis first job? Helping to repaint and repair discarded bikes for kids. It was the start of a lifetime of service to children, plus a few odd jobs here and there.\n\nSelby is a somber spot now. According to Ms. Castile, the building that housed Philandos first place of employment now features a mural of people killed by police.\n\nEight colorful bells lay in a corner in Philandos room, one for each letter of his name. In 2022, kindergarten students at J.J. Hill Montessori School, where he worked as a cafeteria supervisor and mentor, were the stars of a video called Bells for Philando.\n\nProtection and healing are a common theme in this room. Theres a shiny green amulet that Ms. Castile wears as part of her necklace. It matches the tattoo on her right shoulder: the Eye of Horus, an ancient Egyptian symbol that represents well-being and protection.\n\nI know how to fight\n\nJuly 6. Its always a tough date for Ms. Castile and her family. In recent years, they have partnered with Falcon Heights to honor Philando on the 6th and 7th.\n\nAnd even though its been almost a decade since Philandos death, one question remains  a question that has fueled Ms. Castiles warrior spirit.\n\nHow can a simple traffic stop go from zero to a murder? How could that happen? she says.\n\nMr. Yanez, then a St. Anthony Village police officer, pulled Mr. Castile over on the pretense of a broken taillight near the Minnesota State Fairgrounds, Mr. Yanez said later. Mr. Castile, who had a permit to legally carry a firearm, disclosed he had a gun in the car. Within seconds, Mr. Yanez shot him several times in front of Mr. Castiles girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter.\n\nA year later, Mr. Yanez was acquitted of manslaughter and charges of recklessly discharging a weapon. Protests erupted across the Twin Cities.\n\nThe easiest thing that I could have done would have been nothing, says Ms. Castile. But hell no. I know how to fight. Im gonna fight you the way you fight others  with knowledge, with respect, with integrity.\n\nShe and the foundation made national news in 2019 after Ms. Castile made an $8,000 donation at Robbinsdale Cooper High School to clear students lunch debt. The foundations work ultimately led to Gov. Tim Walz signing the Free School Meals for Kids bill in 2023, but not before the Castile name was heard on the Minnesota State Capitol floor.\n\nHe was known as the lunch man, or Mr. Phil, at J.J. Hill. He knew every students name and he never let any of his kids go hungry, said state Sen. Clare Oumou Verbeten in March 2023.\n\nI knew they would pass that bill after her speech, Ms. Castile says. She shamed them. We shamed them.\n\nMs. Castile describes her crusade as a journey. She has met with the actor Kerry Washington, the late civil rights icon John Lewis, and others. She also mentions the singer Alicia Keys, whose Giants exhibit is currently on display at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Phils room was there once as well, so to speak, in a 2018 exhibit called Art and Healing: In The Moment.\n\nHer Phil is resting in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis now, alongside giants including Dred Scott. The Supreme Court decision that bears Scotts name was also a miscarriage of justice. But Ms. Castile remains undeterred.\n\nI know what my destiny is now. God has revealed that to me, she says. He has given me an assignment and a mission, and Im just playing follow the leader."

        "content": "HAVANA  The Cuban women's national volleyball team was denied a chance to play in a tournament in Puerto Rico following the new visa restrictions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Cuban Volleyball Federation said last week that the team, comprising 12 athletes, a referee and several coaches, had their visa request denied and will be unable to attend the tournament later this month.\n\n\"The disappointment is huge because I train every day, every hour of training is leading up to this and dedicate myself to it,\" national team player Laura Suarez told The Associated Press. \"It's really disappointing not to be able to participate in the competition, which is what I've been preparing myself for.\n\nCuba was scheduled to play in the NORCECA Women's Final Four tournament in Manat, Puerto Rico. The tournament includes Puerto Rico, Mexico and Costa Rica and it awards ranking points toward qualification for the Volleyball Nations League.\n\n\"We were focused on the competition because it's right there,\" said Dayana Martnez, another player. \"Arriving at the embassy and being denied the visa affects us a lot because that competition gives us points to improve our ranking,\"\n\nThe Cuban team's coach, Wilfredo Robinson, said the decision means his team is likely to miss out on the Nations League.\n\n\"The competition grants points for each match and at the end it all adds up,\" Robinson said. \"In September, we have another tournament and if we get there needing to achieve 80 or 100 points we are not going to be able to do it.\"\n\nThe United States added Cuba to a list of 12 countries with restrictions for entering the U.S. or its territories, effective from early June. It includes nationals from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Iran, Venezuela and other nations.\n\n\"Denial of visas is part of a racist and xenophobic list of visa restrictions,\" Cuban foreign minister Bruno Rodriguez wrote on his X account.\n\nIn a message sent to The Associated Press, the U.S. Embassy in Cuba stated that, according to its privacy policies, it could not comment on specific cases but that directives were being implemented to secure the borders and protect U.S. communities and citizens.\n\nThe Cuban women's national team won back-to-back world championships in 1994 and 1998. It also won three Olympic golds in a row in Barcelona 1992, Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000.\n\nThe U.S. measures are likely to impact many more Cuban athletes who depend on international competitions, including some on American soil to qualify for major championships and the next Olympics scheduled to be played in Los Angeles in 2028."

        "content": "Diogo Jota, the celebrated Portuguese soccer star who recently won the English Premier League with Liverpool Football Club, has been killed in a car crash, authorities said Thursday.\n\nThe club issued a statement saying it was \"devastated by the tragic passing of Diogo Jota.\"\n\nThe Guardia Civil confirmed in a statement that the 28-year-old star and his brother, Andr Silva, 25, also a professional soccer player, died after their car crashed in the Zamora region at 12:30 a.m.\n\nTributes laid for Diogo Jota at Anfield stadium in Liverpool, England, on Thursday. Jess Hornby / Getty Images\n\n\"In the absence of a conclusion of the experts evidence, everything points that a car left the road, due to a tire blowout while overtaking,\" the police said. The car caught fire and both vehicle occupants were killed by the accident, the statement added.\n\nThe Portuguese national team paid tribute to Jota in a statement on X.\n\n\"Far beyond being an exceptional player, with nearly 50 caps for the national team, Diogo Jota was an extraordinary person, respected by all teammates and opponents, someone with a contagious joy and a reference within his own community,\" it said.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo, a teammate of Jota's in the national side, said on Instagram: \"Doesn't make any sense. Just now we were together in the National Team, just now you were married.\"\n\nAccording to Jota's social media accounts, he got married to his long-term girlfriend, Rute Cardoso, just 10 days ago. The couple have three children together.\n\nSocial media was flooded with tributes from Liverpool fans who expressed support for his wife and children.\n\nBorn in 1996 with the full name Diogo Jos Teixeira da Silva, Jota was a talented player who made 182 total appearances and scored 65 goals for Liverpool, becoming a key part of the championship-winning team in the 2024-25 season. He also played 49 times for the Portuguese national team.\n\nDiogo Jota celebrates Liverpool's Premier League win on May 25. Liverpool FC / Getty Images\n\n\"We have lost two champions. The passing of Diogo and Andr Silva represents irreparable losses for Portuguese Football, and we will do everything to honor their legacy daily,\" the Portuguese national team's statement said.\n\nA skillful forward blessed with pace, great balance and dribbling ability, Jota was sought by a number of top European teams when he moved from England's Wolverhampton Wanderers to Liverpool for a total fee of 45 million pounds ($61.5 million) in 2020.\n\nJota played for the Portuguese team Paos de Ferreira and Spain's Atltico Madrid before joining the English Premier League. One of these former teams, FC Porto, said it was in mourning.\n\nFormer Liverpool stars, including Jamie Carragher and Stan Collymore, paid tribute to Jota.\n\n\"I'm sure like many in the football family there's just a profound sense of shock, sadness and disbelief at the news of Diogo Jota's death at the unfathomably young age of 28. Newly married too,\" Collymore said on X."

        "content": "In this frame-grab made from video, missiles and air-defense interceptors illuminate the night sky over Doha, Qatar, after Iran launched an attack on U.S. forces at Al Udeid Air Base on Monday.\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that Israel and Iran had reached a ceasefire just hours after the Islamic Republic fired missiles at the largest U.S. military installation in the Middle East. Iran had called the attack a mighty retaliation for the American bombardment of its nuclear sites.\n\nPosting on his social media platform around 6 p.m. Eastern, Trump wrote, Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World. During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL.\n\nAfter congratulating the governments of both countries, Trump said, This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didnt, and never will! God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump added that the conflict should be called THE 12 DAY WAR.\n\nHours earlier in the Middle East, sirens sounded in U.S. military facilities in Qatar, Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as Iran launched a volley of missiles at Al Udeid Air Base, which Trump visited five weeks ago.\n\nThe Iranian military declared  in a televised announcement on state TV complete with martial music  the beginning of what it described as a mighty and successful response by the armed forces of Iran to Americas aggression.\n\nBefore Trump posted about a ceasefire, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted a statement notable for its relatively softer tone compared with the rhetoric employed by other officials. We do not harm anyone, Khamenei wrote. We will not accept any harassment from anyone under any circumstance. We will not submit to anyones harassment. This is the logic of the Iranian nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump had said earlier Monday that Iran had given the U.S. advance warning of the attack.\n\nI am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done, he wrote on his platform. Most importantly, theyve gotten it all out of their system, and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE. I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured.\n\nTrump added, Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.\n\nPresident Trump speaks at the Al Udeid Air Base on May 15 in Doha, Qatar. (Alex Brandon / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl Udeid, a sprawling, 60-acre facility southwest of the Qatari capital, Doha, that houses about 10,000 U.S. troops, hosts the forward headquarters of U.S. Central Command, which directs battle operations over a 21-nation region stretching from northeast Africa to South Asia. British and other foreign forces also operate there, alongside the Qatari air force.\n\nResidents in Doha reported their windows rattling as missiles arced overhead before exploding near Al Udeid, while others posted video to social media depicting the missiles streaking through the night sky.\n\nQatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari, in a post on social media, said Qatars air defenses successfully intercepted the missiles, that the base had been evacuated earlier and there were no casualties.\n\nSoon after the attack, the secretariat of Irans Supreme National Security Council, which is overseen by Khamenei, issued a statement saying the targeting of the base does not pose any threat to our friendly and brotherly country, Qatar.\n\nThe statement added that Al Udeid is far away from population centers and that it was hit with the same number of bombs used in the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear installations  a signal, observers say, that Tehran considers itself mollified and would not take further action.\n\nThat placatory language was met by a furious response from Qatari officials, who called the attack a flagrant violation of Qatars sovereignty and its airspace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe affirm that Qatar reserves the right to respond directly in a manner equivalent with the nature and scale of this brazen aggression, in line with international law, said Al Ansari, the Foreign Ministry spokesman.\n\nBut he cautioned that continuing on the path of escalatory actions would lead to catastrophic consequences and that Qatar had warned of the dangers from Israels campaign on Iran.\n\nWe call for the immediate cessation of all military actions and for a serious return to the negotiating table and dialogue, he said.\n\nAn unnamed U.S. defense official quoted by CNN said Al Udeid was attacked by short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles originating from Iran. Other U.S. bases came on full alert, according to local media outlets, as a number of Persian Gulf nations closed their airspace, including Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar, which had shutdown its skies even before the attack on Al Udeid. By midnight all airspace closures were reversed.\n\nEarlier in the day, the U.S. Embassy in Qatar asked U.S. citizens to shelter in place out of what it said was an abundance of caution.\n\nThe strikes are Irans second-largest attack on U.S. forces since 2020, when it fired more than a dozen missiles on U.S. bases in Iraq in retaliation for Trump ordering the assassination during his first term of Iranian Gen. Qassem Suleimani  a decision that was expected to trigger furious retaliation from Tehran but which never materialized beyond the missile fusillade seen mostly as symbolic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMondays barrage comes after repeated threats from Iranian officials of a painful response for the U.S. strike Sunday on the Fordo nuclear facility, even as Israel launched a round of airstrikes Monday morning targeting access roads to Irans flagship uranium enrichment facility.\n\nIsrael also expanded the scope of its attacks to well beyond the nuclear and military targets it had focused on when it launched its campaign June 13. The Israeli military said Monday that it hit Evin Prison, a jail notorious for its incarceration of anti-government dissidents; the internal security headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; and its paramilitary wing.\n\nAt least 400 people have been killed in Iran since Israel launched attacks and more than 3,000 injured, according to Iranian officials. Observer groups believe the death toll to be more than double the state figures.\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 24 people have been killed and 1,361 others injured in retaliatory attacks. Around 15,000 people have been evacuated from their homes.\n\nCompanies operating around the region have already begun taking precautions against a wider conflagration.\n\nOn Monday, Iraqs state-owned Basra Oil Co. said British Petroleum, Eni and TotalEnergies evacuated foreign personnel working in Iraqi oilfields. Marine traffic data reveal some tankers avoiding the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway that Iran is threatening to shut down. And many airlines  both regional and European  remain reluctant to share sky lanes with flying ordnance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumps visit to Al Udeid in May was part of a tour of the Middle East, during which he said the United States and Iran had sort of agreed to a nuclear deal. At Al Udeid on May 15, he said that my priority is to end conflicts, not start them, but I will never hesitate to wield American power if its necessary to defend the United States of America or our partners."

And, it is appropriately tailored because it permits users to verify their ages through the established methods of providing government-issued identification and sharing transactional data, Thomas said.\n\nThe courts three liberals dissented.\n\nUnder the Texas law, a website must use reasonable age verification methods to confirm visitors are at least 18 years old if more than one-third of its content is sexual material harmful to minors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 21 other Republican-led states have adopted similar laws in recent years.\n\nIn defense of the Texas law, Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton said that prior to the internet, the court had upheld laws that required bookstores or magazine stands to check the age of their customers before selling them pornography.\n\nHe argued that moving their business online should not give pornographers a 1st Amendment right to provide access to nearly inexhaustible amounts of obscenity to any child with a smartphone.\n\nState officials also said porn online is increasingly violent and degrading.\n\nThe average child is exposed to internet pornography while still in elementary school, wrote state attorneys for Ohio and Indiana.

Thats an important part of our policy. Its also an important part of our game that we all take great pride in. And its also important for us to honor our flag and our country and I think our fans expect us to do that.\n\nGoodells remarks came after President Donald Trump continued his criticism of the NFL this morning. On Twitter, Trump said: The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!\n\nAfter former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the anthem last year to protest police killings of unarmed black men, dozens of other players joined him to draw greater attention to social and racial injustice. Last month, Trump said the NFL ought to fire players who didnt stand for the anthem.\n\nThe players are not doing this in any way to be disrespectful to the flag, Goodell said today. But they also understand how its being interpreted.\n\nGoodell also said the league wanted to stay out of the political arena over the issue.\n\nWere not looking to get into politics, he told reporters. What were looking to do is to continue to get people focused on football."

The challengers had argued that the measure unlawfully discriminated against these adolescents based on their sex or transgender status. The supreme courts three liberal justices dissented.\n\nThe supreme court in May also allowed Trumps ban on transgender people serving in the military to take effect.\n\nThe challenge to the West Virginia law was brought by Becky Pepper-Jackson and the students mother in 2021 after Pepper-Jacksons middle school barred her from joining the girls cross-country and track teams due to the states ban.\n\nA federal judge ruled in Pepper-Jacksons favor at an early stage of the case, but later reversed course and sided with the state. The supreme court in 2023 refused the states bid to enforce the law as litigation proceeded.\n\nThe Richmond, Virginia-based fourth US circuit court of appeals in April threw out the judges decision, ruling that the laws exclusion of Pepper-Jackson from girls teams violates the Title IX law. The state law treats transgender girls differently from other girls, which is - literally - the definition of gender identity discrimination, the fourth circuit ruling stated, adding that this is also discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX.\n\nThe Idaho challenge was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender Boise State University student who had sought to join the womens track and cross-country teams, but failed to qualify. Hecox has instead participated in sports clubs, including soccer and running, at the public university.\n\nA federal judge blocked Idahos law in 2020, finding that Idahos law likely violates the constitutional equal protection guarantee. The San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals upheld the judges action in 2023 and, in an amended ruling, in 2024.\n\nThe measure unlawfully discriminates based on sex and transgender status, the ninth circuit concluded.\n\nReuters contributed reporting"

Sourced from museums, archives, and personal accounts, it's designed as a central space where others can add their own stories, creating a living historical record.\n\n\"There's this hole in our history,\" said Robt Martin Seda-Schreiber, the center's founder and chief activist. \"And there are great resources about Bayard, but they're all spread out, and none of it has been collected and put together in the way that he deserves, and more importantly, the way the world deserves to see him.\"\n\nA button from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom is held by Walter Naegle, Bayard Rustin's partner, in New York, on June 28. Mary Conlon / AP\n\nRare footage of Rustin speaking at a 1964 New York rally for voting rights marchers who were beaten in Selma, Alabama, was recently uncovered and digitized by Associated Press archivists. Other AP footage shows him addressing a crowd during a 1967 New York City teachers strike.\n\n\"We are here to tell President Johnson that the Black people, the trade union movement, white people of goodwill and the church people  Negroes first  put him where he is,\" Rustin states at the 1964 rally. \"We will stay in these damn streets until every Negro in the country can vote!\"\n\nRustin mentored the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe legacy of Rustin  who died in 1987 aged 75  reaches far beyond the estimated 250,000 people he rallied to attend the March on Washington in 1963, when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have A Dream\" speech. Rustin also played a pivotal role behind the scenes, mentoring King and orchestrating the Montgomery bus boycott.\n\nAnd his influence still guides activism today, reminding younger generations of the power the community holds in driving lasting change through nonviolence, said David J. Johns, a queer Black leader based in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Being an architect of not just that moment but of the movement, has enabled so many of us to continue to do things that are a direct result of his teaching and sacrifice,\" said Johns. He is the CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective, which attributes its advocacy successes in the Black queer space to Rustin's legacy.\n\nFrom left, Bayard Rustin, Rev. Bernard Lee, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in New York City in 1964. Bettmann Archive via Getty Images file\n\nRustin was born into activism, according to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research & Education Institute. His grandparents, Julia Davis and Janifer Rustin, instilled in him and his 11 siblings the value of nonviolence. His grandmother was a member of the NAACP, so Rustin was surrounded and influenced by leaders including the activist and scholar W.E.B. Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson, who wrote \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\"\n\nRustin was expelled from Wilberforce University in 1936 after he organized a strike against racial injustice. He later studied at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, the nation's first historically Black college, then moved to New York during the Harlem Renaissance to engage more deeply with political and social activism. He attended the City College of New York and joined the Young Communist League for its stance against segregation.\n\nRustin served jail time and was posthumously pardoned\n\nRustin was arrested 23 times, including a 1953 conviction in Pasadena, California, for vagrancy and lewd conduct  charges commonly used then to criminalize LGBTQ+ people. He served 50 days in jail and lost a tooth after being beaten by police. California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a posthumous pardon in 2020, acknowledging Rustin had been subjected to discrimination.\n\nRustin and figures such as Marsha P. Johnson, a prominent transgender activist during the gay rights movement, continue inspire the LGBTQ+ community because they \"were super intentional and unapologetic in the ways in which they showed up,\" Johns said.\n\n\"I often think about Bayard and the March on Washington, which he built in record time and in the face of a whole lot of opposition,\" Johns said.\n\nMementos belonging to civil rights leader Bayard Rustin are pictured at his partner Walter Naegle's home in New York on June 28. Mary Conlon / AP\n\nWalter Naegle, Rustin's partner and a consultant on projects related to his life and work, said it's important for the queer community to have access to the history of social movements.\n\n\"There wasn't very much of an LGBTQ+ movement until the early 50s,\" said Naegle. \"The African American struggle was a blueprint for what they needed to do and how they needed to organize. And so to have access to all of the Civil Rights history, and especially to Bayard's work  because he was really the preeminent organizer  I think it's very important for the current movements to have the ability to go back and look at that material.\"\n\nRustin had to step away from leadership for several years\n\nRustin's sexuality and his former association with the Young Communist League forced him to step away as a Civil Rights leader for several years.\n\nIn 1960, New York congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. threatened to spread false rumors that Rustin and King were intimately involved, weaponizing widespread homophobia to undermine their cause, according to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute.\n\nBut Rustin resumed his work in 1963 as chief organizer of the March on Washington, which became a defining moment in the Civil Rights Movement and paved the way for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nA plaque honoring Bayard Rustin is pictured outside of his partner Walter Naegle's home in New York on June 28. Mary Conlon / AP\n\nIn 2023, Netflix released the biopic, \" Rustin. \" Filmmaker and co-writer Julian Breece, who is Black and queer grew up in the '90s when, he said, being gay still correlated with the spread of AIDS, leading to shame and isolation. But he learned about Rustin's impact on the Civil Rights Movement and found a peer to admire.\n\n\"Seeing a picture of Rustin with King, who is the opposite of all those things, it let me know there was a degree to which I was being lied to and that there was more for me potentially, if Bayard Rustin could have that kind of impact,\" Breece said.\n\n\"I wanted Black gay men to have a hero they could look up to,\" he said."

        "content": "Editors Note: Joe Lieberman, an independent, is a former US Senator who represented Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. He was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 2000 presidential election. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN \n\nWhen Ralph Nader ran for president in 2000, he offered a simple rationale for a bid that would ultimately help spoil the election for the Democratic ticket I was privileged to be on with Al Gore. In Naders view, the two parties were ideologically indistinguishable.\n\nThat argument was baseless. There were significant differences in policy between the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney ticket  which ended up victorious, in part thanks to Nader  and ours. For Nader, this wasnt really about the two-party duopoly, as he coined it. This was about his desire to push Gore and the Democratic Party to the left.\n\nJoe Lieberman Courtesy Joe Lieberman\n\nToday, of course, no one can reasonably argue that the two parties arent ideologically distinct. The core problem in Washington, DC, is that theyre too divided to get much done.\n\nThough a majority of Americans long for the era when Republicans and Democrats worked together to find bipartisan solutions to big problems, many members of Congress refuse to work together on immigration, the debt ceiling and other issues critical to the nation, even when bipartisanship is the way to restore our common prosperity and security. Indeed, today, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate, bipartisanship is the only way to pass any legislation.\n\nWhile undoing the divisions plaguing our political system will not be simple, there is one step that can be taken  and it begins with giving voters a real alternative in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nMost often, when Americans cast their votes for president and vice president, their ballot has only two viable tickets: one nominated by the Democratic Party and the other by the Republican Party. But what would happen if they had a third viable option?\n\nThe process for adding that third viable option is not only arduous and time-consuming, but it varies from state to state and in the District of Columbia.\n\nToday, No Labels, a nonprofit organization that I co-chair, is laying the groundwork for such a campaign in 2024. Since early 2022, our team has been diligently working across the country to obtain ballot access for a potential No Labels ticket, typically by collecting a certain number of petition signatures from voters in each state.\n\nIf we are successful, a unity ticket  comprised of one Democrat and one Republican  could be presented to voters right next to the Republican and Democratic nominees.\n\nWe think of this as an insurance policy for the country  an option to be deployed if, and only if, both of the two major party nominees fail to offer voters a choice of candidates theyd like to vote for or a way out of the partisan divisiveness that now dominates in the nations capital. We will be consistently monitoring the sentiment of Americans through our own research and polling, as well as public polling, to make that determination.\n\nIn this and several other ways, No Labels effort could not be more different from the spoiler campaign that Nader attempted two decades ago.\n\nFirst, if No Labels were to lend its ballot lines to a presidential ticket, the presidential candidate would be a Democrat and the vice presidential candidate would be a Republican, or vice versa. As such, it would appeal to some voters who might otherwise have voted for the Democratic ticket, and other voters who might otherwise have voted for the Republican ticket. And it would appeal to still other voters who would not have voted for either.\n\nThese nominees would be selected by a diverse and distinguished group of citizens serving on a committee  and would be ratified by delegates who would gather at the No Labels National Convention planned for April 2024. This convention will occur about six weeks after the March 5th Super Tuesday primaries, a day which historically has clarified who the major party nominees will be.\n\nSecond, No Labels 2024 effort is not designed to push the Democratic nominees to the left or Republican candidates to the right. Rather, its intended to force one or both parties to appeal to Americas growing commonsense majority. If they dont, our ballot line will create the opening for a unity ticket that will.\n\nAccording to recent polling by CNN, the number of individuals who identify as independent is on the rise, now comprising 41% of the electorate  compared to only 28% who described themselves as Democrats and 31% who described themselves as Republicans. These numbers are more evidence that there could be a potential path to victory for an independent ticket in 2024.\n\nBut if there doesnt appear to be such a path in the months ahead, No Labels will stand down, focusing instead on the work we have done over the last decade to elect and organize members of the House and Senate who have demonstrated the courage to reach across the aisle  including members of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\nIt seems the Biden administration already may be beginning to recognize the imperative of appealing to the commonsense majority. President Joe Biden recently signed into law a Republican measure to strike down a Washington, DC, crime bill reducing penalties for those who commit violent crimes, and he announced more stringent border control policies.\n\nOur hope is that the Republicans jockeying for their partys nomination will similarly see the need to reach out beyond their base instead of appealing to divisive policies and politics.\n\nIn the end, No Labels hopes not to have to offer our ballot line to an independent unity ticket. We want the parties to come to their senses. But judging from the angry and apocalyptic reactions of strategists in both parties at the thought of No Labels insurance policy, it is clear that party leaders now know that there could be a political cost to ignoring the commonsense majority. And thats a reason to hope for a better future for our government and our country."

Ron DeSantis that federal money would be used to operate the controversial Everglades immigrant detention center, the state has so far received no federal funds, according to court documents filed Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn filings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, DHS officials said that the facility has relied only on state funding so far and that Florida has not yet applied for federal funding.\n\nFlorida has received no federal funds, nor has it applied for federal funds related to the temporary detention center, it reads. Courts cannot adjudicate hypothetical future funding decisions or render advisory opinions on contingent scenarios that never materialize.\n\nThe filing was the agencys response to a lawsuit filed by two environmental groups asking that the facility be shuttered. DHS argued it has no such authority because the department has not implemented, authorized, directed, or funded Floridas temporary detention center.\n\nThe facility, dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, gained national attention even ahead of its opening Tuesday. Trump and some of his top administration officials joined state officials for a tour of the facility, and the president said hed like to see similar facilities constructed in other states. It is expected to cost $450 million a year to operate, according to Florida officials.\n\nDuring the event, Trump said the federal government was not just going to help reimburse the state for costs, but that it also helped with construction  which was done in just eight days under the authority of an emergency immigration order DeSantis signed in 2023 and has extended several times since then.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, Florida Gov.

During President Joe Bidens administration, the same pot of money was used to house undocumented people, a point Trump and other Republicans have long criticized, at times baselessly, as spending taxpayer dollars to house undocumented migrants in luxury hotels in New York City.\n\nWe took the FEMA money that Joe Biden allocated to pay for the free luxury hotel rooms where hes paying hundreds of millions of dollars in New York City, and we used it to build this project Trump said.\n\nLast week, DeSantis also told reporters that the facility will be funded largely by the FEMA program.\n\nAlligator Alcatraz will be funded largely by FEMAs Shelter and Services Program, which the Biden administration used as a piggy bank to spend hundreds of millions of American taxpayer dollars to house illegal aliens, he said. Now, it is being used to detain criminal illegal aliens while they await deportation.\n\nDHS on Thursday said the federal government will still use the FEMA funds to pay in large part for the facility.\n\nThese new facilities will in large part be funded by FEMAs Shelter and Services Program, which the Biden Administration used as a piggy bank to spend hundreds of millions of American taxpayer dollars to house illegal aliens, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.\n\nThe Shelter and Services Program is a reimbursement-based program, which means states must apply for reimbursements related to eligible costs. The facility has been open for fewer than three days, so the issue could center on Florida just not yet applying for the FEMA funds because of the early work.\n\nThe Florida Attorney Generals Office and the Florida Department of Emergency Management, the agency responsible for applying for reimbursements, did not return requests seeking clarification.\n\nThe admission that no federal funding has yet been sent to the state comes amid behind-the-scenes tension between top DHS officials, including Secretary Kristi Noem, and DeSantis over the governors handling of the facilitys rollout. Federal officials wanted the main unveiling to coincide with Trumps visit Tuesday, but DeSantis did a tour of the facility with Fox and Friends last Friday, something that caught both federal and some state officials off guard.\n\nDHS called the claims fake news when NBC News first reported the tensions Tuesday but did not refute the claims.\n\nDeSantis upset Noem and Lewandowski with his Fox News tour of the detention site, a Republican operative familiar with the process told NBC News on Tuesday, referring to Corey Lewandowski, Noems close adviser. Noem wanted an event for Tuesday and didnt want anyone having eyes on the site and needed to push until Tuesday because she was traveling.\n\nThe first group of detainees arrived Thursday, and the facility is supposed to hold 3,000 people."

Thats why the Democrats are doomed, he wrote in a TwitLonger post.\n\nThe Democratic establishment has vortexed the partys narrative energy into hysteria about Russia (a state with a lower GDP than South Korea). It is starkly obvious that were it not for this hysteria insurgent narratives of the type promoted by Bernie Sanders would rapidly dominate the partys base and its relationship with the public. Without the, We didnt lose  Russia won narrative the partys elite and those who exist under its patronage would be purged for being electorally incompetent and ideologically pass. The collapse of the Democratic vote over the last eight years is at every level, city, state, Congressional and presidential.\n\nAssange may have a point, insofar as the Russia narrative has consumed so much of the media landscape that it may have eclipsed Democrats efforts to regain the roughly 1,000 legislative seats it has lost over the past nine years.\n\nDemocrats have also lost all four of the congressional special elections since January, and the predicted surge in Democratic turnout has failed to materialize. As Salons Andrew OHehir pointed out, the reason the races were close is because Republicans had an even worse turnout.\n\nWithout collusion, we are left with the Democratic establishment blaming the public for being repelled by the words of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party establishment, Assange wrote.\n\nTheres an obvious comeback here: Assange and WikiLeaks likely played a role in the election outcome by leaking hacked Democratic Party emails that were presumably provided by Russian intelligence, either directly or through an intermediary. But the questions Assange has posed are nonetheless valid.\n\nIs it a problem that the public discovered what Hillary Clinton said to Goldman Sachs and what party elites said about fixing the DNC primaries against Bernie Sanders? Assange wrote. A party elite that maintains that it is the crime of the century for the public and their membership to discover how they behave and what they believe invites scorn.\n\nAssange finished by calling for the formation of a new party. The Democratic base should move to start a new party since the party elite shows no signs that they will give up power."

        "content": "CNN \n\nThe governor of Oklahoma is calling on four McCurtain County officials to resign after they allegedly participated in a secretly recorded conversation that included racist remarks about lynching Black people and talking about killing journalists.\n\nThe McCurtain Gazette-News over the weekend published the audio it said was recorded following a Board of Commissioners meeting on March 6.\n\nThe paper said the audio of the meeting was legally obtained, but the McCurtain County Sheriffs Office said in a statement that it was illegally recorded and is investigating. The sheriffs office also said it believes the recording had been altered.\n\nI am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain County, Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement Sunday. There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office. I will not stand idly by while this takes place, the statement said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt. Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP\n\nThe governor called for the immediate resignations of McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy, District 2 Commissioner Mark Jennings, sheriffs investigator Alicia Manning and jail administrator Larry Hendrix. He also said he would ask the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.\n\nMcCurtain County is in southeastern Oklahoma, about 200 miles from Oklahoma City.\n\nThe recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriffs office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported.\n\nIn the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspapers office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, the Oklahoman reported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News.\n\nAccording to the Oklahoman report, Jennings said, Oh, youre talking about you cant control yourself? and Manning replied: Yeah, I aint worried about what hes gonna do to me. Im worried about what I might do to him. My papaw would have whipped his a**, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper  if my daddy hadnt been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.\n\nJennings replied that his father was once upset by something the newspaper published and started to go down there and just kill him, according to the Gazette-News.\n\nI know where two big, deep holes are here if you ever need them, Jennings allegedly said. Clardy, the sheriff, allegedly said he had the equipment.\n\nIve got an excavator, Clardy is accused of saying during the discussion. Well, these are already pre-dug, Jennings allegedly said.\n\nIn other parts of the recording, officials expressed disappointment that Black people could no longer be lynched, according to the paper.\n\nCNN has not been able to verify the authenticity of the recording or confirm who said what. CNN has reached out to all four county officials for comment.\n\nThe Oklahoma Sheriffs Association voted Tuesday to suspend the membership of Clardy, Manning and Hendrix, the groups executive director told CNN.\n\nState and local agencies investigating\n\nWillingham and his father, Bruce Willingham, the papers publisher, have been advised to temporarily leave town, CNN affiliate KJRH reported.\n\nFor nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County, Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe McCurtain County Sheriffs Office said in a statement Monday that there is an ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties. It also said the recording has yet to be duly authenticated or validated.\n\nOur preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered. The motivation for doing so remains unclear at this point. That matter is actively being investigated, the statement said.\n\nThe Oklahoma Attorney Generals Office has received an audio recording and is investigating, Communications Director Phil Bacharach said.\n\nThe FBI wouldnt confirm or deny whether it was involved in the investigation, with spokesperson Kayla McCleery saying it is agency policy not to comment."

        "content": "Editors Note: A version of this story first published in 2019.\n\nCNN \n\nIts a surprising fact thats often overlooked in the immigration debate.\n\nUndocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in federal taxes annually, between tax returns filed and taxes deducted from paychecks, experts estimate.\n\nHeres a look at why  and how  this is happening.\n\nWhy some undocumented immigrants choose to pay taxes\n\nThe National Immigration Law Center breaks down a number of reasons why undocumented immigrants pay taxes, including:\n\n It shows theyre complying with federal tax laws.\n\n It can help them demonstrate good moral character if they later have an opportunity to legalize their immigration status.\n\n Tax return records could be used to document work history and presence in the US, steps that may help them be eligible for legal immigration status in the future if lawmakers pass immigration reform.\n\nHow some pay taxes despite not having Social Security numbers\n\nCritics of illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are able to do so because theyre using stolen Social Security numbers. But millions of federal tax dollars are paid every year by people who dont have Social Security numbers at all.\n\nInstead, they file using whats known as an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, notes that most experts believe the vast majority of tax returns filed with ITINs today are filed by undocumented immigrants.\n\nSome noncitizens who legally immigrated to the United States also pay taxes using this method.\n\nIn 2019, according to the IRS, more than 2.5 million tax returns were filed using ITINs, accounting for nearly $6 billion in taxes.\n\nIn addition to tax return filings, officials estimate that undocumented immigrants also contribute billions to Social Security annually through payroll tax deductions. In 2010, for example, the Social Security Administration estimated that payments from unauthorized workers accounted for about $12 billion in tax revenue for Social Security.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates are speaking out on social media\n\nIn recent years, immigrant rights advocates posts on Facebook, Twitter and TikTok during tax season have drawn attention to the issue.\n\nUndocumented immigrants pay billions in taxes to fund programs they cant access, the National immigration Law Center wrote in a series of recent social media posts.\n\nIn 2017, Beln Sisas post about her experience paying taxes went viral.\n\nWanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday? wrote Sisa, who was a college student in Arizona at the time.\n\nThe beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program later told CNN she felt it was important to speak out.\n\nI wanted to show people that were here, and that we come from all over the world, and that we contribute more than people think that we do, she said.\n\nJose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist whos turned his struggles as an undocumented immigrant into a platform for advocacy, took a break from finalizing his taxes in 2019 to share his experience on Twitter.\n\nYes, he wrote, undocumented immigrants are helping fund the very systems that detain and deport us."

        "content": "La Boca del Lobo, a 2019 Times short documentary, follows the work of Mario Guevara, a reporter based in the outskirts of Atlanta who has a large audience among Latino immigrants in the area. In one scene, a woman tells Guevara that her husband, who had just been detained by ICE agents, had walked into la boca del lobo (into the wolfs mouth, an expression meaning into the lions den). The immigration-enforcement agency had more than quadrupled noncriminal arrests in Atlanta in the 2017 fiscal year and was causing havoc in Spanish-speaking communities. Guevara, a forty-seven-year-old Salvadoran immigrant, is the only reporter in Atlanta (and possibly in the United States) who has been covering these raids every day for years. Mr. Guevaras job, and his obsession, is to stalk the wolf, Jesse Moss, the director of the video, wrote in an accompanying piece for the Times.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nNow Guevara himself has been detained by ICE agents. On June 14th, he was arrested while live-streaming a No Kings protest near Atlanta, and he is currently being held in an immigration-detention center. His case highlights the particularly vulnerable position of immigrant journalists who report on immigration for immigrant communities. As attacks on press freedom mount, including the intimidation of journalists covering protests, reporters are becoming targets of the law-enforcement and immigration agencies that they cover.\n\nGuevaras career as a journalist in El Salvador was brief but deeply consequential. When he was in his early twenties, he joined the photojournalism desk at La Prensa Grfica, one of the countrys main newspapers. He was very young and very enthusiastic, Francisco Campos, a renowned photojournalist who was then his editor, told me. Guevara lived in Apopa, a district north of San Salvador, the capital city, which was by then falling under the control of the marasgangs that originated in Los Angeles and whose members were deported en masse to El Salvador in the nineteen-ninetieswho routinely threatened those who didnt pay them a renta (protection money). Guevara confided to Campos that he was afraid of them.\n\nIn 2003, Campos sent him to cover a mass protest in front of the national-government complex in San Salvador. The organizer was the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (F.M.L.N.), a left-wing guerrilla organization during the civil war that had become a legitimate political party following the 1992 peace accords. Just over a decade had passed since the end of the brutal twelve-year-long conflict, and street protests often ended in violence. As a journalist with La Prensa Grfica, Guevara was a target: F.M.L.N. sympathizers saw the paper as a political enemy, because it had supported the military through the war. A group of protesters attacked Guevara, who sought refuge at the nearby Ministry of Justice. He was then driven to a police station, where Campos picked him up later that day. Guevara later told CNN that he had received death threats during this period; in the documentary, he reiterates that he had made some enemies and was promised two bullets in the chest. In early 2004, Guevara, with his wife and young daughter, left El Salvador for the United States, reportedly arriving on a tourist visa. He settled in Atlanta and eventually requested asylum.\n\nGuevara managed to get a job at a local, now defunct newspaper, Atlanta Latino. In 2007, he moved to Mundo Hispnico, an outlet owned at the time by Cox Enterprises, which also owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Mundo Hispnico became the leading Spanish-language news outlet in Georgia, with numbers rivalling those of English-language outlets: by 2020, it had 4.9 million followers on Facebook, while the Journal-Constitution had just 837,000. This growth coincided with a rapid rise in the states Latino population; according to the Atlanta Regional Commission, there was a more than thirty per cent increase in the Atlanta metro area between 2010 and 2020.\n\nDuring the Obama Administration, a federal program that allows ICE to partner with state and local law enforcement expanded across the region, and the number of detentions ballooned. Guevara began covering them as they occurred, to document their personal and communal toll. Shortly before the start of the first Trump Administration, Guevara began noticing abandoned vans on the sides of roads, often with ladders attached to the roof and coffee thermoses left inside, and realized that ICE was targeting vans carrying migrant construction workers. He began driving around the Atlanta region at dawn, when ICE operations were most frequent, to catch and live-stream those raids.\n\nGuevara built a huge immigrant audience on social media; he now has more than 1.4 million followers across all platforms, including almost nine hundred thousand on Facebook. He forged a direct relationship with them by answering their messages and by speaking to them, or by driving around their neighborhoods and introducing himself. They often sent him tips, which he pursued and turned into stories. He had eyes and ears everywhere, Lautaro Grinspan, a bilingual immigration reporter with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, told me. When they had trouble getting an official tally of immigration arrests in the area, the second-best source was Mario. Grinspan, who profiled Guevara in May, just a few weeks before his arrest, added that it is hard to overstate his influence in the Spanish-language community. He was a singular presence in our media ecosystem. Now he finds himself in the bowels of the immigration-detention system, experiencing firsthand something he used to write about.\n\nIn La Boca del Lobo, Guevara recalls receiving a tip: ICE had surrounded a building and was knocking on the door. When Guevara arrived at the scene, officers had already cordoned off the area. He began live-streaming and, at one point, realized that the migrant they were after was watching the operation live on his Facebook page. The man contacted Guevara and asked him to mediate with the ICE agents so that they wouldnt shoot him when he left the building. Guevara informed the officers that the man inside was afraid to come out, and they communicated with himthrough Guevarauntil he surrendered. In the same video, Guevara states that, as a reporter, he doesnt take sideshe often interviews ICE agents and police officers for their perspectivebut he notes that the raids create a lot of fear and terror. A lot of panic. There are people who wont go to work nor send their kids to school after a raid in their neighborhood. That fear is not letting them continue with their normal life. He adds, I understand that fear. Sometimes I think Ill be next.\n\nBy then, Guevaras asylum request had been denied. In June, 2012, a judge had ordered him to leave the country within sixty days, but his lawyers obtained administrative closure, a procedure by which an immigration judge can temporarily pause removal proceedings. Guevara and his wife have two sons born in the U.S., and Guevara applied for a green card as an immediate relative of a citizen. According to one of his lawyers, Giovanni Daz, he was granted a temporary work permit. His green-card request is still pending. In a recent press conference, Guevaras daughter mentioned that one of her brothers, who is now twenty-one and is sponsoring his fathers request, had to undergo two surgeries to remove a brain tumor and depends on his father financially and emotionally.\n\nGuevara continued reporting despite his legal vulnerability. He left Mundo Hispnico last year to launch his own operation, MGNews. On June 14th, wearing a red shirt, a helmet, and a black vest that read PRESS in large white letters on the front and back, he went to cover the No Kings protest. A group of local police officers closed in on him, and, while he loudly identified himself as a member of the media, they arrested him. He is very, very well known in the community, even with these jurisdictions and these police officers . . . Its hard to believe they didnt know who he was, Daz, his lawyer, said during the press conference.\n\nGuevara was taken to the DeKalb County Jail and charged with three misdemeanors: obstruction of law-enforcement officers, unlawful assembly, and pedestrian improperly entering roadway. A few days later, three additional misdemeanor charges were filed in Gwinnett Countyfor ignoring traffic signs, using a communication device while driving, and reckless drivingwhich stemmed from an incident in May, in which, according to Daz, Guevara was recording law-enforcement operations. (Dekalb County dropped the charges on June 25th, but the ones filed in Gwinnett County are still pending. Guevaras lawyers said in a press release that it is very uncommon for traffic warrants to be sought out after the alleged illegal activity. Nevertheless, we are working to obtain more information about these warrants and find out the reason why they were not brought earlier. Mr. Guevara is innocent until proven guilty.) On June 18th, the police turned Guevara over to ICE, and he was transferred to the Folkston ICE Processing Center in southeastern Georgia. On Friday, June 20th, ICE announced that it had initiated deportation proceedings.\n\nFrancisco Campos, the photojournalist in El Salvador who was Guevaras editor, and who has remained in touch with him, saw the news of the arrest on Guevaras social-media accounts. In these twenty-some years since he left, Mario has helped several people here, he told me. About ten years ago, he said, Guevara came to the aid of a campesino in Sensuntepeque, a remote area near the border with Honduras. The man had been forced to mortgage his land after gang members had extorted him, and the bank was about to foreclose. Guevara raised the money, Campos said, which was deposited directly in the bank to cancel the mans debt and to insure that he maintained the property title. Sending Guevara back to El Salvador would be a very unfortunate situation, Campos said. Newsrooms have laid off about sixty per cent of their staff. Many journalists are unemployed. This is not a country where you can come and launch a successful news channel like the one he has there. For him, it would be personally devastating.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (where I serve as a board member), along with a coalition of civil-society and media organizations, expressed alarm at Guevaras detention in a letter to Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and demanded his release. If Guevaras case proceeds, it would represent a grim erosion of both freedom of the press and the rule of law. Journalists who are not U.S. citizens could be at risk of deportation solely because local law enforcement filed misdemeanor charges against them in retaliation for reporting without those charges ever being tried in court, the letter reads. (The Press Freedom Tracker has documented the arrest of eleven journalists since Trumps Inauguration, including Guevaras, all at anti-ICE protests, and is working to verify the arrest of four more.) In an X post from June 20th, the Department of Homeland Security denied that Guevara had been detained because of his work and said that he was in ICE custody because he had entered the country illegally in 2004. (Daz reiterated to NPR that Guevara had entered the U.S. legally on a tourist visa.)\n\nMaritza Flix, the founder and director of the Spanish-language news outlet Conecta Arizona, based in Phoenix, has known Guevara for years. She told me that news of his arrest compounded what has been a traumatizing few months for reporters, especially those who came to the U.S. seeking the freedom that they lacked in their home countries. Today, it was Mario, but tomorrow it could be any one of us. We used to believe we were in a country where the law and the Constitution were respected. She said that her team has seen an uptick in hate messages in e-mails and on social mediaGo back to your country, Speak Englishand have been forced to adopt safety measures she never imagined would be necessary here."

        "content": "In America, theres a significant kind of public insistence that ones freedom is fundamentally tied to ones wealth.\n\nMuch of the country views America through an aspirational and transformative lens, a colorblind and bias-free utopia, wherein wealth conveys equality and acts as a panacea for social and racial ills. Once an individual achieves massive financial success, or so the message goes, he or she will transcend the scourge of economic and racial inequality, truly becoming free.\n\nWorking in parallel with this reverence for this colorblind version of the American Dream is the belief that economic privilege mandates patriotic gratitude. Across industries and disciplines, Americans are told to love their nation uncritically, be thankful that they are exceptional enough to live in a country that allows citizens the opportunity to reach astronomical heights of economic prosperity.\n\nFor the nations black citizens, theres often an additional racialized presumption lurking under the surface of these concepts: the notion that black success and wealth demands public silence on systemic issues of inequality and oppression.\n\nOnes economic privilege is a lousy barrier against discrimination and oppression.\n\nThese are durable and fragile ideologies that prop up the concept of the American Dream  durable because they are encoded in the very fabric of American culture (most Americans, including African Americans, have readily embraced these ideologies as assumed facts); yet fragile because its all too easy to see that ones economic privilege is a lousy barrier against both individual and systemic discrimination and oppression.\n\nConsequently, black people have also been among the most vocal challengers of these ideologies, as weve seen most recently with the Colin Kaepernick and the NFL #TakeAKnee demonstrations. In a show of solidary with the free agent quarterback, professional football players  the vast majority of whom are black  have been kneeling during the National Anthem as a means of protesting racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nWATCH: NFL players team up in defiance and solidarity\n\nOver the past few weeks, the president of the United States has brought renewed attention to the inherent tensions that define the ideologies of the American Dream through his repeated public criticisms of these kneeling NFL players.\n\nIf a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, Trump recently tweeted, he or she should not be allowed to kneel. Labeling the protestors actions disrespectful to the country, flag and anthem, President Donald Trump has called for players to be fired, encouraged a boycott of the NFL, insisted that the league pass a rule mandating that players stand for the anthem and derided the protestors as sons of bitches.\n\nIn a dramatic ploy more befitting of a scripted reality television show, the president gloated that he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence to walk out of an Indianapolis Colts game the moment any player kneeled. This was an orchestrated show of power and outrage, designed to send a flamboyant political message given that Trump and Pence knew in advance that on that particular day, the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers  the team that currently has the most protestors. The NFLs announcement this week that the league has no plans to penalize protesting players is the most recent event to provoke the presidents fury; taking to social media during the early morning, he once again equated kneeling with total disrespect for our country.\n\nAs many have pointed out, the presidents moralizing outrage toward the NFL players is selective and deeply flawed  his apparent patriotic loyalty hasnt stopped the billionaire politician from criticizing the removal of Confederate statues, or attacking a Gold Star family, or mocking Sen. John McCains military service.\n\nBy aggressively targeting the NFL players, Trump believes that he is winning the cultural war, having made black millionaire sport athletes his new [Hillary Clinton].\n\nThe NFL players and their defenders have repeatedly stated that the protests are intended to highlight racial inequality and oppression. Theyve also explained that their decision to kneel emerged from a desire to protest peacefully and respectfully after a sustained conversation with military veterans.\n\nTrump has chosen to ignore these rationales and the structural issues of inequality that motivate the protests and instead, advance a narrative exclusively concerned with overt displays of American patriotism and the privilege of the NFL players. As one of presidents advisors explained, by aggressively targeting the NFL players, Trump believes that he is winning the cultural war, having made black millionaire sport athletes his new [Hillary Clinton].\n\nREAD MORE: As Americas sport, the NFL cannot escape politics\n\nIts a cynical statement, revealing the presidents perception of the jingoism of his base of supporters who envision him as a crusader for American values and symbols.\n\nIn casting the black protestors as the antithesis of all of this, Trump has marked the players as unpatriotic elites and enemies of the nation. For a president who has consistently fumbled his way through domestic and foreign policy since he was elected, a culture war between hard-working and virtuous working-class and middle-class white Americans and rich, ungrateful black football players is a welcome public distraction.\n\nTrumps attacks on the NFL protestors are rooted in those competing tensions inherent to the American Dream: that wealth equals freedom; that economic privilege demands patriotic gratitude; and most importantly, that black peoples individual economic prosperity invalidates their concerns about systemic injustice and requires their silence on racial oppression.\n\nAmong the protestors detractors, this has become a common line of attack, a means of disparaging the black NFL players activism by pointing to their apparent wealth. The fact that systemic racism is demonstrably real and that individual prosperity does not make one immune to racial discrimination appears to be lost on the protestors critics.\n\nTheirs is a grievance that suggests that black athletes should be grateful to live in this country; that racism cant exist in America since black professional athletes are allowed to play and sign contracts for considerable sums of money; that black players owe the nation their silence since America gave them opportunity and access; that black athletes have no moral authority on issues of race and inequality because of their individual success; and that black athletes success was never theirs to earn, but instead, was given to them and can just as easily be taken away.\n\nBlack athletes have long been hyper-aware of their peculiar place in American society: beloved for their talents, yet reviled the moment they use their public platform to protest.\n\nThis culture war being waged over black athletes is not new. Black athletes  and entertainers  have long been hyper-aware of their peculiar place in American society as individuals beloved for their athletic and artistic talents, yet reviled the moment they use their public platform to protest systemic racial inequality. The parallels between the #TakeAKnee protests and the protests of Muhammad Ali or John Carlos and Tommie Smith are readily apparent; so too are there important similarities to the case of Paul Robeson.\n\nAn outspoken civil rights activist, collegiate and professional football player, lawyer, opera singer and actor, Robeson had his passport revoked in 1950 because of his political activism and speech  actions that all but destroyed his career. The star athlete and entertainer, who had exemplified American upward mobility quickly became public enemy number one as institutions cancelled his concerts, the public called for his death and anti-Robeson mobs burned effigies of him.\n\nDuring a 1956 congressional hearing, the chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities beat a familiar refrain with Robeson, challenging the entertainers accusations of American racism and racial oppression. He saw no sign of prejudice, he argued, since Robeson was privileged, having gone to elite universities and playing collegiate and professional football.\n\nREAD MORE: Poll: Americans divided on NFL protests\n\nBlack athletes, even the silent ones, largely understand that their economic privilege doesnt insulate them from the realities of racial discrimination. They also understand that their wealth and success is precarious and is often dependent not only upon their athletic performance, but also upon them remaining silent on issues of racial injustice, especially those that appear to question the American Dream or implicate the American public by association.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that Colin Kaepernick, whose protests turned him into a national pariah despite his on-the-field talents, has filed a grievance against the NFL, accusing the league and its teams of blackballing him because of his political beliefs. Principled and peaceful political protest, Kaepernicks lawyers argued in a statement, should not be punished and athletes should not be denied employment based on partisan political provocation by the Executive Branch of our government. Whether the ostracized Kaepernick will win his grievance is unknown, but it is certainly telling that he and his lawyers have rooted their claims in contested definitions of freedom and the precarious economic privilege of outspoken NFL players.\n\nFor the loudest and most vocal critics of black protestors, in particular, outspokenness is tantamount to treason, grounds for the harshest of punishments. Perhaps they would benefit from a close reading of James Baldwin, who once argued: I love America more than any other country in this world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "The US dollar has had its worst first half-year in more than 50 years, as the financial markets over the last six months were dominated by geopolitical crises and Donald Trumps trade war.\n\nThe dollar has fallen by 10.8% against a basket of currencies since the start of 2025. That is its worst performance over the first six months of any year since 1973, and the worst half-year since the second half of 1991.\n\nThis sell-off has pulled the dollar index down to its lowest level since March 2022 and lifted the pound to a three-year high of $1.37, up from $1.25 at the start of the year.\n\nInvestors have been selling the US currency due to concerns that Trumps economic policies threaten the safe-haven role of US dollar-denominated assets, with economists predicting that the presidents big beautiful budget bill will drive the US national debt even higher.\n\nAnalysts at Unicredit said: The US dollar is the most notable loser so far this year as it has lost 10% against other currencies, with investor concerns regarding Trumps policies having weighed on the greenback. On the other hand, the euro has risen by 5%.\n\nDavid Morrison, a senior market analyst at the financial services company Trade Nation, said: Trumps tariffs, the fact that many investors view his administration as somewhat chaotic, along with concerns over US national debt have seen the dollar fall out of favour.\n\nRising expectations of US interest rate cuts have also hurt the dollar, as Trump has repeatedly criticised the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, for not lowering borrowing costs and hinted that Powells replacement would push for rate reductions and could be named early.\n\nChris Iggo, the chair of the Axa IM Investment Institute, said broader market returns had been strong in the first half of 2025. Any sell-off in risky assets has been quickly reversed. Even measures of implied volatility have moved lower. Traders are betting more heavily on multiple US interest rate cuts, he said.\n\nStock markets have had a turbulent 2025 so far  most have posted gains over the last six months but getting there was a bumpy journey.\n\nCarsten Brzeski, the global head of macro at ING Research, said it had been an action-packed first six months of the year, with key developments including tariffs, market volatility, questions about Fed independence, a US credit downgrade, fiscal stimulus on steroids, rising debt, deportations, visa restrictions for foreign students, the war in Ukraine entering its fourth year, and Germany doing a fiscal U-turn with a likely doubling of defence spending.\n\nUS and European markets weakened through March as Trump sparred with China, Mexico and Canada over trade deals, before a global sell-off in early April after his announcement of hefty Liberation Day tariffs alarmed investors. That tumble  the worst week for the US stock market since 2020  appeared to alarm the White House, prompting a 90-day pause on tariffs and claims of Taco  Trump always chickens out.\n\nSo although the US has only signed a single trade deal so far, with the UK, hopes of further progress  or a further pause on tariffs  triggered a historic rebound that lifted the S&P 500 index of US stocks to a record high by the end of June.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, it was only the third time in the last 100 years that the S&P 500 has dropped 10% and rebounded to a gain within the same calendar quarter.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said US equities had fully brushed off the sell-off led by the trade war.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day  we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Theres also the conviction that the Federal Reserve will cut rates sooner rather than later, that earnings growth will remain strong despite trade uncertainties, and that AI will eventually boost productivity and reduce costs.\n\nEven so, US markets have lagged behind some European markets. The S&P 500 has only gained 5% during 2025 so far, slower than the pan-European Stoxx 600 (+7%), the UKs FTSE 100 (up 7.2%), or Germanys Dax (up 20%).\n\nThe UK has been one of the best-performing regions globally for investors in the first half of 2025.\n\nTariffs, downgrades to earnings and economic forecasts and geopolitical conflict were the defining factors for markets in the first half of 2025, said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. Theyve caused considerable uncertainty which has affected asset prices, as well as business and consumer confidence. Its led to one of the biggest shifts in investor preferences for years, with certain parts of the market coming to life and previous winners losing their crown. Were now seeing the great big asset allocation reset and the US is no longer top choice for many investor portfolios.\n\nTechnology stocks have had a mixed half-year. Shares in Facebooks owner, Meta, had a strong six months, up 25%, as its artificial intelligence investments have driven revenue growth. Apple, though, has lost almost 20% due to fears that tariffs on imports from China will hurt its US operations and that it has fallen behind in the AI race.\n\nDean Turner, an economist at UBS, said it had been an interesting time for investors. Optimism at the start of the year, driven by solid growth and earnings, was eviscerated as markets digested the Liberation Day tariff announcements, which triggered the steepest equity correction since the pandemic  the S&P 500 fell 10.5% in two days, volatility spiked, and the dollar weakened. Since then, markets have rebounded quickly as some tariffs were paused and strong AI earnings supported a recovery, he said.\n\n2025 has also been another strong year for gold. Its price has jumped by 25% as investors have sought out safe-haven assets.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has arrested the Mexican boxer Julio Csar Chvez Jr in California and begun proceedings to deport him, citing cartel affiliations, multiple criminal convictions and an active arrest warrant in Mexico for weapons trafficking and organized crime.\n\nChvez Jr, 39, the son of the legendary world champion Julio Csar Chvez Sr, was taken into custody by Ice agents on Tuesday in Studio City, a Los Angeles neighborhood known for celebrity residences. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), he had been living in the US unlawfully and posed a significant threat to public safety.\n\nNonetheless, just five days before his arrest, Chvez Jr was allowed to participate in a heavily promoted boxing match against the YouTuber-turned-fighter Jake Paul in Anaheim. The fight promoter claimed that the match which Chvez Jr lost to Paul proved to be the highest-grossing boxing event ever held at Anaheims Honda Center, with one outlet estimating it generated more than $1.5m in gate revenue.\n\nChvez Jr first entered the US legally on a six-month tourist visa in August 2023. He later filed for permanent residency in April 2024, citing marriage to a US citizen. That application raised alarms within federal agencies due to what officials described as multiple fraudulent statements and connections to the Sinaloa cartel, a powerful drug-trafficking organization labeled a foreign terrorist group by the Trump administration.\n\nHis arrest comes amid mounting political tension over the Biden administrations immigration enforcement policies. Internal DHS documents reportedly showed that although Chvez was flagged as an egregious public safety threat in December 2024, his removal was not prioritized. In January 2025, despite those warnings, Chvez was allowed re-entry into the country at the San Ysidro port of entry in California under a discretionary parole process.\n\nThis Sinaloa Cartel affiliate with an active arrest warrant for trafficking guns, ammunition, and explosives was arrested by Ice, said the DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a sharply worded statement. It is shocking the previous administration flagged this criminal illegal alien as a public safety threat but chose to not prioritize his removal and let him leave and come back into our country.\n\nFederal officials allege Chvez Jr has longstanding ties to organized crime. In Mexico, he is wanted on charges of weapons trafficking and manufacturing explosives without authorization. In the United States, he has a criminal record dating back more than a decade. He was convicted of DUI in California in 2012, and more recently, in January 2024, he was convicted of illegal possession of an assault weapon and manufacturing or importing a short-barreled rifle.\n\nThe boxer has struggled with substance abuse and legal trouble throughout his career. Once seen as a rising star in Mexican boxing, who held the World Boxing Councils version of the middleweight title from 2011 through 2012, his in-ring performances in recent years have been overshadowed by repeated arrests, erratic behavior and suspensions.\n\nChvezs wife  through whom he filed for a green card  has also drawn scrutiny. DHS officials say she was previously in a relationship with one of Joaqun El Chapo Guzmns sons, though she has not been charged with any crime.\n\nChvez is currently in Ice custody and will be processed for expedited removal. A spokesperson for his legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe arrest highlights ongoing friction between immigration enforcement priorities and public safety concerns."

        "content": "An injured man is helped after an explosion in downtown Tehran on Sunday.\n\nIran and Israel traded air raids and ballistic missile barrages overnight and into the evening Sunday, with neither side showing any inclination to back down from an escalating grudge match between the two longtime enemies.\n\nThe fighting, which came after Israel launched withering attacks Friday decapitating Irans top military leadership and hitting its nuclear infrastructure, killed at 128 people in Iran on Friday and Saturday and wounded nearly 1,000 others, according to the Iranian government.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of giving Israel the green light for the operation. President Trump denied the charge and warned Iran against retaliating against the U.S. Also Sunday, there were news reports that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Iranian government has yet to provide an updated death toll, but Human Rights Activists, a Washington-based group, was quoted by the Associated Press on Sunday as having calculated at least 406 dead and 654 wounded. Iranian Health Minister Mohammad-Reza Zafarghandi said in an interview with state media that most of the casualties were women and children.\n\nIrans retaliatory strikes have killed at least 14 people  including children  and wounded 390 others in Israel, according to health authorities there.\n\nMeanwhile, both nations have girded themselves for a lengthy confrontation. Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said in an interview with state media that metro stations and mosques would be open 24 hours a day starting Sunday night for use as shelters. Residential buildings in Iran do not have shelters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMohajerani added there would be no problem in providing food, medicine and fuel.\n\nIsraeli soldiers search through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed by an Iranian missile strike in Bat Yam, central Israel, on Sunday. (Baz Ratner / Associated Press)\n\nIsraels National Security Council warned citizens against entering the country through its land borders with Jordan and Egypt  nations with decades-old peace treaties with Israel that have pro-Palestinian populations. Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, meanwhile, was also closed.\n\nThe rhetoric and the growing scale of the damage indicate that an diplomatic offramp will not be soon forthcoming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last three days, Israel has attacked military bases, sites and airports, including in Isfahan, Arak and Kermanshah; residences of military commanders and nuclear scientists; and the countrys top uranium enrichment facility in Natanz.\n\nBut Israel has also widened the scope of its strikes to hit economic targets, turning vital parts of Irans fossil fuel infrastructure into infernos. The attacks hit the Shahran gas depot, a major hub in Tehran, and the South Pars field, according to the Iranian Oil Ministry. The latter is the worlds largest natural-gas field, yielding about two-thirds of Irans gas production. The ministry reported that the Fajr Jam Gas Refining Co. was also targeted.\n\nThe attacks have roiled energy markets fearful of disruptions to Iran, an oil and gas powerhouse with the worlds second-largest proven natural gas reserves and the third-largest crude oil reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nOil prices surged by at least 7% on the day Israel launched its campaign, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a report that an extended military confrontation or the closure of the Strait of Hormuz  the passageway for a fifth of global oil  could push oil prices, now about $74 a barrel, as high as $130 a barrel.\n\nAn Israeli fusillade around noon Sunday and in the afternoon saw four areas in Tehran targeted, including major commercial thoroughfares, according to state media.\n\nIf Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front, Tehran will burn, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Irans leadership has maintained a defiant tone, vowing to meet any aggression with a more severe and powerful response, according to a statement by Pezeshkian on Saturday.\n\nThree days into the conflict, a certain rhythm has settled in, with reports of Israeli airstrikes on Iran followed soon after by barrages of ballistic missiles traveling about 1,000 miles between Iran and Israel  a 12-minute journey over Iraq, Syria, Jordan and occasionally Lebanon. Though Israels defense system and a network of pro-U.S. allies have shot down most of the 270 missiles lobbed by Iran, some have hit their mark.\n\nBroadcasts have depicted rescue crews picking through the rubble of destroyed buildings to extricate survivors in cities mostly untouched in previous bouts of violence, such as Tel Aviv. On Sunday evening, a missile slammed into the northern port city of Haifa, with a broadcast showing an explosion briefly illuminating the nighttime sky.\n\nWhen we took this historic decision, tough decision, we knew we will have difficult times and we will face casualties, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said in an interview with CNN on Sunday.\n\nBut saying that, we didnt have any other choice.\n\nIsrael asserts that its actions are preemptive and aimed at ensuring a setback for Irans nuclear ambitions. When Israel launched its campaign, the U.S. and Iran were in the midst of negotiations over Tehrans nuclear program, with the sixth round of those negotiations slated for Sunday in the Omani capital, Muscat. The talks were canceled amid accusations by Iranian officials of U.S. complicity in Israels attacks.\n\nIn a Cabinet meeting on Sunday, Pezeshkian said the U.S. had given Israel the go-ahead for its actions, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. What we are witnessing today is being done with the direct support of Washington, he said."

        "content": "The U.S Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by Los Angeles landlords who said the citys COVID-19 evictions ban violated the Constitution.\n\nWith two conservatives in dissent, the Supreme Court on Monday turned down a property-rights claim from Los Angeles landlords who say they lost millions from unpaid rent during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency.\n\nWithout comment, the justices said they would not hear an appeal from a coalition of apartment owners who said they rent over 4,800 units in luxury apartment communities to predominantly high-income tenants.\n\nThey sued the city seeking $20 million in damages from tenants who did not pay their rent during the pandemic emergency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey contended that the citys strict limits on evictions during that time had the effect of taking their private property in violation of the Constitution.\n\nIn the past, the court has repeatedly turned down claims that rent control laws are unconstitutional, even though they limit how much landlords can collect in rent.\n\nBut the L.A. landlords said their claim was different because the city had in effect taken use of their property, at least for a time. They cited the 5th Amendments clause that says private property [shall not] be taken for public use without just compensation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2020, the city of Los Angeles adopted one of the most onerous eviction moratoria in the country, stripping property owners ... of their right to exclude nonpaying tenants, they told the court in GHP Management Corporation vs. City of Los Angeles. The city pressed private property into public service, foisting the cost of its coronavirus response onto housing providers.\n\nBy August 2021, when [they] sued the City seeking just compensation for that physical taking, back rents owed by their unremovable tenants had ballooned to over $20 million, they wrote.\n\nA federal judge in Los Angeles and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 3-0 decision dismissed the landlords suit. Those judges cited the decades of precedent that allowed the regulation of property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe court had considered the appeal since February, but only Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch voted to hear the case.\n\nI would grant review of the question whether a policy barring landlords from evicting tenants for the nonpayment of rent effects a physical taking under the Taking Clause, Thomas said. This case meets all of our usual criteria. ... The Court nevertheless denies certiorari, leaving in place confusion on a significant issue, and leaving petitioners without a chance to obtain the relief to which they are likely entitled.\n\nThe Los Angeles landlords asked the court to decide whether an eviction moratorium depriving property owners of the fundamental right to exclude nonpaying tenants effects a physical taking.\n\nIn February, the city attorneys office urged the court to turn down the appeal.\n\nAs a once-in-a-century pandemic shuttered its businesses and schools, the city of Los Angeles employed temporary, emergency measures to protect residential renters against eviction, they wrote. The measure protected only those who could prove COVID-19 related economic hardship, and it did not excuse any rent debt that an affected tenant accrued.\n\nThe city argued that the landlords are seeking a radical departure from precedent in the area of property regulation.\n\nIf a government takes property, it must pay for it, the city attorneys said. For more than a century, though, this court has recognized that governments do not appropriate property rights solely by virtue of regulating them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city said the COVID emergency and the restriction on evictions ended in January 2023.\n\nIn reply, lawyers for the landlords said bans on evictions are becoming the new normal. They cited a Los Angeles County measure they said would preclude evictions for non-paying tenants purportedly affected by the recent wildfires."

        "content": "A flood gauge marks the height of water flowing over a farm-to-market road near Kerrville, Texas, on Friday.\n\nTexas Hill Country was beset by death and disaster Friday as at least six people were killed and about 20 girls attending a summer camp were reported missing after months worth of heavy rain fell in a matter of hours, leaving search teams to conduct boat and helicopter rescues in the fast-moving water.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick said somewhere between six and 10 bodies had been found so far in the frantic search for victims. Meanwhile, during a news conference conducted at the same time as Patricks update, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha reported that there were 13 deaths from the flooding.\n\nAt least 10 inches of rain poured down overnight in central Kerr County, causing flash flooding of the Guadalupe River and leading to desperate pleas for information about the missing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome are adults, some are children, Patrick said during a news conference. Again, we dont know where those bodies came from.\n\nTeams conducted dozens of rescues, and emergency responders continued to search for those who were unaccounted for.\n\nComments on a Facebook post from the Kerr County sheriffs office were riddled with photos of people in the flood zone. Loved ones posted there, hoping someone could offer an update on the whereabouts of those they hadnt heard from. One woman said she couldnt reach her daughter, who had rented a cabin in Hunt for her husband and two children, and pleaded for someone to post the names of those already evacuated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudge Rob Kelly, the chief elected official in the county, confirmed fatalities from the flooding and dozens of water rescues so far. He said he was advised not to cite specific numbers and said authorities are still working to identify those whose lives were lost.\n\nMost of them, we dont know who they are, Kelly said during a news conference. One of them was completely naked, he didnt have any ID on him at all. Were trying to get the identity of these folks, but we dont have it yet.\n\nOne family survives a terrifying ordeal\n\nErin Burgess home sits directly across from the river in the Bumble Bee Hills neighborhood, west of Ingram. When she woke up to thunder at 3:30 a.m. Friday, it was raining pretty heavy, but no big deal, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust 20 minutes later, Burgess said, water was coming in through the walls and rushing through the front and back doors. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree and waiting for the water to recede enough that they were able to walk up the hill to a neighbors.\n\nMy son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them, she said, becoming emotional.\n\nOf her 19-year-old son, Burgess said: Thankfully hes over 6 feet tall. Thats the only thing that saved me, was hanging on to him.\n\nA flood watch issued Thursday afternoon estimated isolated amounts up to 7 inches of rising water. That shifted to a flood warning for at least 30,000 people overnight.\n\nWhen asked about the suddenness of the flash flooding overnight, Kelly said that we do not have a warning system and that we didnt know this flood was coming  even as local reporters pointed to the warnings and pushed for answers about why more precautions werent taken.\n\nRest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming, he said. We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said the state was providing resources to Hill Country communities dealing with the flooding, including in Kerrville, Ingram and Hunt.\n\nThe Texas Hill Country, a scenic and rocky gateway to booming vineyards and vacation rentals, begins west of the state capital and is a popular outdoor summer getaway. Parts of the region are prone to flash flooding.\n\nDozens of people posted on Facebook asking for any information on their children, nieces and nephews attending one of the many camps in the area, or family members who went camping during the holiday weekend.\n\nThe Ingram Fire Department posted a photo of a statement from Camp Mystic, saying the private Christian summer camp for girls experienced catastrophic level floods. Parents with a daughter not accounted for were directly contacted, the camp said.\n\nAnother camp on the river located east of Hunt, Camp Waldemar, said in an Instagram post that we are all safe and sound.\n\nThe Guadalupes river gauge at the unincorporated community of Hunt, where the river forks, recorded a 22-foot rise in just about two hours, according to Bob Fogarty, meteorologist with the National Weather Services Austin/San Antonio office. Fogarty said the gauge failed after recording a level of 29 feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the kind of thing that will catch you unaware, Fogarty said. The waters moving so fast, youre not going to recognize how bad it is until its on top of you.\n\nSevere weather in New Jersey\n\nMeanwhile, strong thunderstorms were being blamed for at least three deaths in central New Jersey, including two men in Plainfield who died after a tree fell onto a vehicle they were traveling in during the height of a storm there, according to a city Facebook post.\n\nThe men were ages 79 and 25, officials said. They were not immediately publicly identified.\n\nOur hearts are heavy today, Mayor Adrian O. Mapp said in a statement. This tragedy is a sobering reminder of the power of nature and the fragility of life.\n\nThe city canceled its planned Fourth of July parade, concert and fireworks show. Mapp said the devastating storms had left deep scars and widespread damage in the community of more than 54,000 people and it was a time to regroup and focus all of our energy on recovery.\n\nContinuing power outages and downed trees were reported Friday throughout southern New England, where some communities received large amounts of hail. There were reports of cars skidding off the road in northeastern Connecticut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFingerhut writes for the Associated Press.\n\n"

        "content": "On a sun-kissed hillside in remote Northern California, I watched in awe as a crackling fire Id helped ignite consumed the tall, golden grass. Then the wind shifted slightly, and the dense gray smoke that had been billowing harmlessly up the slope turned and engulfed me.\n\nWithin seconds, I was blind and coughing. The most intense heat Id ever felt seemed like it would sear the only exposed skin on my body: my face. As the flames inched closer, to within a few feet, I backed up until I was trapped against a tall fence with nowhere left to go.\n\nAlone in that situation, I would have panicked. But I was with Len Nielson, chief of prescribed burns for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, who stayed as cool as the other side of the pillow.\n\nLike a pilot calmly instructing passengers to fasten their seat belts, Nielson suggested I wrap the fire-resistant shroud hanging from my bright yellow helmet around my face. Then he told me to take a few steps to the left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, just like that, we were out of the choking smoke and into the gentle morning sunlight. The temperature seemed to have dropped a few hundred degrees.\n\nIt became uncomfortable, but it was tolerable, right? Nielson asked with a reassuring grin. Prescribed fires are a lot about trust.\n\nDripping gasoline onto dry grass and deliberately setting it ablaze in the California countryside felt wildly reckless, especially for someone whose job involves interviewing survivors of the states all too frequent, catastrophic wildfires. But good fire, as Nielson called it, is essential for reducing the fuel available for bad fire, the kind that makes the headlines. The principle is as ancient as it is simple.\n\nBefore European settlers arrived in California and insisted on suppressing fire at every turn, the landscape burned regularly. Sometimes lightning ignited the flames; sometimes it was Indigenous people using fire as an obvious, and remarkably effective, tool to clear unwanted vegetation from their fields. Whatever the cause, it was common for much of the land in California to burn about once a decade.\n\nSo it was relatively calm, Nielson said, as the flames wed set danced and swirled just a few feet behind him. There wasnt this big fuel load, so there wasnt a chance of it becoming really intense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that in mind, the state set an ambitious goal in the early 2020s to deliberately burn at least 400,000 acres of wilderness each year. The majority of that would have to be managed by the federal government, since agencies including the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service own nearly half of the states total land. And they own more than half of the states forests.\n\nCal Fire crew members set a prescribed burn near Hopland in Mendocino County. (Josh Edelson / For The Times)\n\nBut California officials worry their ambitious goals are likely to be thwarted by deep cuts to those federal agencies by Elon Musks the budget-whacking White House advisory team, dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. In recent months, the Forest Service has lost about 10% of its workforce to mass layoffs and firings. While firefighters were exempt from the DOGE-ordered staffing cuts, employees who handle the logistics and clear the myriad regulatory hurdles to secure permission for prescribed burns were not.\n\nTo me, its an objective fact that these cuts mean California will be less safe from wildfire, said Wade Crowfoot, Californias secretary of natural resources. He recalled how President Trump, in his first term, erroneously blamed the states wildfires on state officials who, Trump said, had failed to adequately rake the forests.\n\nFifty-seven percent of our forests are owned and managed by the federal government, Crowfoot said. If anybody failed, it was the president, he argued.\n\nLarry Moore, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, said the job cuts wont affect the agencys fire prevention efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Forest Service continues to ensure it has the strongest and most prepared wildland firefighting force in the world, Moore wrote in an email. The agencys leaders are committed to preserving essential safety positions and will ensure that critical services remain uninterrupted.\n\nCal Fire crew members plot out the direction and scope of a prescribed burn in Mendocino County. (Josh Edelson / For The Times)\n\nNevertheless, last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom added $72 million to the states forest management budget to bridge some of the gap expected to be left by federal agencies. But wildfire experts say thats just a drop in the bucket. Doing prescribed burns safely takes a lot of boots on the ground and behind-the-scenes cajoling to make sure local residents, and regulators, are on board.\n\nBecause people get pretty testy when you accidentally smoke out an elementary school or old-folks home, burn plans have to clear substantial hurdles presented by the California Environmental Quality Act and air quality regulators.\n\nIt took three years to get all the required permissions for the 50-acre Hopland burn in Mendocino County, where vineyard owners worried their world-class grapes might get a little too smoky for most wine lovers. When the big day finally arrived in early June, more than 60 firefighters showed up with multiple fire engines, at least one bulldozer and a firefighting helicopter on standby in case anything went wrong.\n\nThey gathered at the University of Californias Hopland Research and Extension Center, where students learn about ranching and wilderness ecology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this was no school project. A fire that began in the surrounding hills a couple of years ago threatened to trap people in the center, so the area being burned was along the only two roads that could be used to escape.\n\nWere trying to create a buffer to get out, if we need to, said John Bailey, the centers director. But were also trying to create a buffer to prevent wildfire from coming into the center.\n\nSmoke emanates from a prescribed burn in Mendocino County. (Josh Edelson / For The Times)\n\nAs the firefighters pulled on their protective yellow jackets and pants, and filled their drip torches with a mixture of diesel and gasoline, Nielson bent down and grabbed a fistful of the yellow grass. Running it through his fingers, he showed it to his deputies and they all shook their heads in disappointment  too moist.\n\nThick marine-layer clouds filled the sky at 7 a.m., keeping the relative humidity too high for a good scorching. In many years of covering wildfires, it was the first time I had seen firefighters looking bored and disappointed because nothing would burn.\n\nBy 8:45 a.m., the clouds cleared, the sun came out, and the grass in Nielsons fist began to crinkle and snap. It was time to go to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fire that would fill the sky and drift north that afternoon, blanketing the town of Ukiah with the familiar orange haze of fire season, began with a single firefighter walking along the edge of a cleared dirt path. As he moved, he made little dots of flame with his drip torch, drawing a line like a kid working the edges of a picture in a coloring book.\n\nAdditional firefighters worked the other edges of the field until it was encircled by strips of burned black grass. That way, no matter which direction the fire went when they set the center of the field alight, the flames would not  in most circumstances  escape the relatively small test patch.\n\nOn the uphill edge of the patch, along the top of a ridge, firefighters in full protective gear leaned against a wooden fence with their backs to the smoke and flames climbing the hill behind them. Theyd all done this before, and they trusted those black strips of pre-burned grass to stop the fire before it got to them.\n\nTheir job was to keep their eyes on the downward slope on the other side of the ridge, which wasnt supposed to burn. If they saw any embers drift past them into the green zone, they would immediately move to extinguish those flames.\n\nNielson and I were standing along the fence, too. In addition to the circle of pre-burned grass protecting us, we were on a dirt path about four feet wide. For someone with experience, that was an enormous buffer. I was the only one who even flinched when the smoke and flames came our way.\n\nAfterward, when I confessed how panicked I had felt, Nielson said it happens to a lot of people the first time they are engulfed in smoke. Its particularly dangerous in grass fires, because they move so fast. People can get completely disoriented, run the wrong way and get cooked, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrass fires are particularly dangerous, because they move so fast, says Cal Fire Staff Chief Len Nielson. People can get disoriented in the smoke, run the wrong way and get cooked. (Josh Edelson / For The Times)\n\nBut that test patch was just the warmup act. Nielson and his crew were checking to make sure the fire would behave the way they expected  pushed in the right direction by the gentle breeze and following the slope uphill.\n\nIf youre wondering where fire will go and how fast it will move, think of water, he said. Water barely moves on flat ground, but it picks up speed when it goes downhill. If it gets into a steep section, where the walls close in like a funnel, it becomes a waterfall.\n\nFire does the same thing, but its a gas, so it goes the opposite direction, Nielson said.\n\nWith that and a few other pointers  we watched as three guys drew a line of fire around the base of a big, beautiful oak tree in the middle of the hillside to shield it from what was about to happen  Nielson led me to the bottom of the hill and handed me a drip torch.\n\nOnce everybody was in position, and all of the safety measures had been put in place, he wanted me to help set the head fire, a 6-foot wall of flame that would roar up the hill and consume dozens of acres in a matter of minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts gonna get a little warm right here, Nielson said, but its gonna get warm for only a second.\n\nAs I leaned in with the torch and set the grass ablaze, the heat was overwhelming. While everyone else working the fire seemed nonchalant, I was tentative and terrified. My right hand stretched forward to make the dots and dashes where Nielson instructed, but my butt was sticking as far back into the road as it could get.\n\nI asked Nielson how hot he thought the flames in front of us were. I used to know that, he said with a shrug. I want to say its probably between 800 and 1,200 degrees.\n\nWith the hillside still burning, I peeled off all of the protective gear, hopped in a car and followed the smoke north along the 101 Freeway. By lunchtime, Ukiah, a town of 16,000 that bills itself as the gateway to the redwoods, was shrouded in haze.\n\nEverybody smelled the smoke, but prescribed burns are becoming so common in the region, nobody seemed alarmed.\n\nDo it! said Judy Hyler, as she and two friends walked out of Stans Maple Cafe. A veteran of the rampant destruction of wildfires from years past, she didnt hesitate when asked how she felt about the effort. I would rather it be prescribed, controlled and managed than what weve seen before."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "CNN \n\nMillions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans.\n\nThe California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy.\n\nMcCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations  a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.\n\nThis is where the risk to Americans comes in. Its hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes.\n\nMost countries dont require the legislature to raise the governments borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default.\n\nAt least, thats the way it has worked until now.\n\nMcCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since its got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nBut in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members.\n\nRep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts.\n\nI dont know whats in the package completely. Thats the issue, Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNNs Manu Raju, Im open to it but Im still a no vote.\n\nIt is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. The question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? Weve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House, he added. So well have the first opening offer here. And well see if the presidents willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.\n\nMcHenrys comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthys belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit\n\nIn effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since theres no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support.\n\nStill, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday hed have the votes to pass his initial bill.\n\nI think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling, McCarthy told CNN. Weve got a lot of consensus within the conference. Well get together and work through it.\n\nHis assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his partys most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams.\n\nBut with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthys immediate political ambitions, that are on the line.\n\nRepublicans are yet to agree on their own demands\n\nSo far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOPs position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain.\n\nI think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in, Johnson told CNNs Manu Raju. The reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?\n\nAnother complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle  no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthys narrow majority  secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations  they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since theyd presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldnt risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.\n\nThe coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies.\n\nRepublicans may have less leverage than they think\n\nThere is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits  even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion. And Bidens big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis.\n\nBut are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthys position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.\n\nRepublicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldnt believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a negotiating wedge. Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office.\n\nMcCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation\n\nIn order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff.\n\nHe tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasnt a default but rising national debt.\n\nWithout exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, its irresponsible, he said.\n\nPrevious fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction.\n\nMcCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why hes trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men havent met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget  which House Republicans are yet to produce  and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with Americas reputation as a financial haven at stake.\n\nMcCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the governments borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default  especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But its hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown.\n\nThe White House twisted that particular knife on Monday.\n\nThere is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking  as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office, spokesman Andrew Bates said.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall.\n\nPresident Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House, McConnell said, though notably didnt volunteer to get involved.\n\nMcCarthys speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil.\n\nAs Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and Ill be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default."

        "content": "Stocks tumble after Trump posts letters to 14 countries threatening new tariffs\n\nStocks tumbled Monday after President Trump threatened to impose new import taxes on more than a dozen countries. Trump pushed back the effective date of those tariffs, however, until Aug. 1.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nInvestors got an unwelcome reminder this week that President Trump still likes tariffs.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nStocks tumbled Monday after the president threatened to impose stiff new import taxes on more than a dozen countries, including Japan and South Korea. Trump pushed back the effective date of those tariffs, however, until August 1. And if recent history is a guide, he could change course before that. In the meantime, though, U.S. importers are facing several more weeks of tariff limbo.\n\nFADEL: NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now to discuss all this. Hi, Scott.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.\n\nFADEL: So, Scott, it feels like tariffs, no tariffs, tariffs, no tariffs - a little bit like \"Groundhog Day\" here. What's going on?\n\nHORSLEY: Yeah. Well, Trump posted letters on social media yesterday threatening to slap 25% tariffs on everything the U.S. imports from Japan and South Korea, along with even higher rates on goods from other smaller trading partners. Those tariff rates are similar to the ones Trump called for back in April, using a formula based on the U.S. trade deficit with each country. Of course, back in April, he backed down after a sharp sell-off in the stock market. At the time, the president said he was suspending the highest tariffs for 90 days to allow time to make new trade deals. Now, that 90-day window closes tomorrow, and so far, not a lot of new deals have been struck. So once again, Trump is pushing back the effective date for another 3 1/2 weeks. So who knows what the real tariff rate will ultimately be? For now, the waiting game continues.\n\nFADEL: So what does that mean for trading partners or for U.S. businesses and consumers?\n\nHORSLEY: For trading partners, they might be wondering just how serious Trump is since he keeps moving the goalposts. The two countries that have struck trade deals, the U.K. and Vietnam, did not get any real tariff relief from the United States. For businesses that depend on imports or consumers who, say, want to buy a Japanese car or a Korean appliance, this just means more uncertainty. Should they race to buy now before the tariffs go up? Should they wait to see if tariffs will be lower down the road? It's hard to make a decision when the rules keep changing. And Scott Lincicome, who is a trade expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, says that's where we are right now.\n\nSCOTT LINCICOME: We have no idea what tariffs will be in August. We have no idea what they'll be next year. And that is a brutal investment environment for either importers or individuals looking to invest in the United States.\n\nHORSLEY: A report from the Institute for Supply Management last week said this tariff limbo is really weighing on the U.S. factory sector, which, by the way, is supposed to be the beneficiary of the president's trade war. As one factory manager quoted in the report put it, \"customers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty.\"\n\nFADEL: OK. And meanwhile, the government continues to collect tens of billions of dollars in tariff revenue. How's that going?\n\nHORSLEY: So far this year, the government's collected close to a hundred billion dollars in tariffs. More than two-thirds of that has come in just since April, when Trump announced his worldwide import taxes. Lincicome says foreign companies might absorb some of that tariff expense, but most of the tax is going to fall on families and businesses here in the United States.\n\nLINCICOME: Barring a really radical departure from the traditional economics, it means that somebody in America is paying all of those new taxes.\n\nHORSLEY: And even though the higher tariffs have been pushed back until at least August 1, the average tax on imports today is five or six times what it was before Trump returned to the White House and launched this new trade war.\n\nFADEL: NPR's Scott Horsley.

        "content": "Julio Csar Chvez Jr. arrives for his cruiserweight boxing match against Jake Paul in Anaheim on Saturday.\n\nUnited States immigration agents have detained prominent Mexican boxer Julio Csar Chvez Jr. and are working to deport him, with officials saying he has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for his involvement in organized crime and trafficking firearms, ammunition, and explosives.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested Chvez, 39, in Studio City on Wednesday and are processing him for expedited removal from the U.S., according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.\n\nA Homeland Security news release said Chvez had been flagged as a public safety threat, but the Biden administration indicated in internal records he was not an immigration enforcement priority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year in January, officials said, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested Chvez and he was charged with illegal possession of an assault weapon and manufacture or import of a short barreled rifle. He was later convicted of the charges.\n\nChvezs manager, Sean Gibbons, told The Times they are currently working on a few issues following the boxers arrest but had no further comment.\n\nMichael A. Goldstein, a lawyer who has worked with Chvez in previous cases, said his client was detained outside of his residence by 25 or more ICE and other law enforcement agents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey blocked off his street and took him into custody leaving his family without any knowledge of his whereabouts, Goldstein said. The current allegations are outrageous and appear to be designed as a headline to terrorize the community. Mr. Chavez is not a threat to the community.\n\nThe son of Mexican boxing legend Julio Csar Chvez, widely regarded as the greatest boxer in his countrys history, Chvez Jr. faced off on Saturday against influencer-turned-fighter Jake Paul and lost.\n\nTwo weeks before the Anaheim bout against Paul, Chvez held a public workout in Maywood, where he spoke to The Times. He revealed that one of his trainers had skipped the training session out of fear of immigration enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was even scared, to tell you the truth. Its very ugly, Chvez said. I dont understand the situation  why so much violence? There are a lot of good people, and youre giving the community an example of violence. Im from Sinaloa, where things are really ugly, and to come here, to such a beautiful country with everything... and see Trump attacking immigrants, Latinos, for no reason. Not being with God makes you think you know everything. Trump made a bad decision.\n\nHe added: After everything thats happened, I wouldnt want to be deported.\n\nWhen U.S. officials announced the arrest Thursday, they referred to Chvez as an affiliate of the Sinaloa cartel. The Trump administration has designated the Mexican drug trafficking group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\nUnder President Trump, no one is above the law  including world-famous athletes, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the Homeland Security news release, Chvez entered the country legally in August 2023, with a B2 tourist visa that was valid until February 2024. He had filed an application for lawful permanent resident status last year in April, officials said, based on his marriage to Frida Muoz, a U.S. citizen, who U.S. officials said is connected to the Sinaloa cartel through a prior relationship with the now-deceased son of the infamous cartel leader Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.\n\nEl Chapo, a known fan of Chvez Sr. during his fighting days, is now serving a life sentence in U.S. federal prison after a 2019 conviction for his leadership role in the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nMuoz was previously in a relationship with Edgar Guzmn Loera, El Chapos eldest son, who was killed in Sinaloa in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple had a daughter, Frida Sofa Guzmn Muoz. Following Edgars death, Muoz distanced herself from the family and moved to the United States, eventually beginning a relationship with Chvez. Their daughter, Frida Sofa, has recently launched a music career and frequently attends her stepfathers fights, including the most recent fight in Anaheim.\n\nChvez has faced criticism over alleged associations with figures linked to drug trafficking. In lengthy social media videos, he has claimed friendship with Ovidio Guzmn, another son of El Chapo who court records show has agreed to plead guilty to federal drug trafficking charges in Chicago.\n\nLast year, on Dec. 17, according to the Homeland Security news release, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services made a referral to ICE that Chvez was an egregious public safety threat.\n\nHowever, an entry in a DHS law enforcement system under the Biden administration indicated Chvez was not an immigration enforcement priority, the release stated.\n\nAccording to the release, Chvez was allowed to reenter the country on Jan. 4 at the San Ysidro port of entry.\n\nFollowing multiple fraudulent statements on his application to become a Lawful Permanent Resident, he was determined to be in the country illegally and removable on June 27, the Homeland Security release stated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChvez has been in the boxing spotlight since childhood, often walking to the ring alongside his father. He began his professional career in 2003 and reached the pinnacle in 2011 when he won the WBC middleweight title against Sebastian Zbik. He defended the belt three times before losing it to Sergio Martnez in 2012.\n\nHowever, his career has been plagued by discipline issues, substance abuse, and struggles with making weight. In 2017, he faced fellow Mexican star Sal Canelo lvarez, suffering a lopsided unanimous decision loss that marked a turning point in his careers decline.\n\nNicknamed El Hijo de la Leyenda (Son of the Legend) or simply JR, Chvez Jr. has had legal and personal troubles in recent years. He was arrested on suspicion of weapons possession and later entered a residential rehab facility. His battle with addiction has frequently played out in the public eye, including viral social media disputes with his father, one of his most vocal critics, yet also his most steadfast supporter.\n\nAccording to Homeland Security, Chvez was convicted in 2012 of driving under the influence of alcohol and was sentenced to 13 days in jail and 36 months of probation.\n\nGoldstein, Chvezs lawyer, noted that his client is a public figure who has been living and working in the U.S. without issue in recent weeks. Goldstein pointed to his recent fight, saying, His workouts were open to the public and afforded law enforcement countless opportunities to contact him if he was indeed a public threat.\n\nHe has been focused on his own personal growth and mental health, Goldstein said. He is in full compliance with his mental health diversion and all court obligations. For this reason, we fully expect his only pending case to be dismissed as required by statute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2023, according to Homeland Security, a judge in Mexico issued an arrest warrant for Chvez for the offense of organized crime for the purpose of committing crimes of weapons trafficking and manufacturing crimes.\n\nThe release said the warrant was for those who participate in clandestinely bringing weapons, ammunition, cartridges, explosives into the country; and those who manufacture weapons, ammunition, cartridges, and explosives without the corresponding permit.\n\nMexican authorities, who typically do not reveal the full names of suspects in criminal cases, said Thursday that federal prosecutors had issued an arrest warrant for Julio C in March 2023 for organized crime and arms trafficking. A news release from Mexicos equivalent of the attorney generals office said U.S. officials had started the process of turning him over to face justice.\n\nChvezs family issued a statement Thursday afternoon that said, We reiterate our total and unconditional support to Julio.\n\nWe have full confidence in his innocence, the statement said. We firmly believe that the proper course is to allow the competent authorities to carry out their work without external pressure or speculation.\n\nMexico City bureau chief Patrick J. McDonnell contributed to this report."

        "content": "This is a tale of blackmail and revenge, or so it goes. Of power and money, lots of money. It is also a story of sport, and thats the way they want it now. The buildup to Wednesdays semi-final of the Club World Cup between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid, those two empires and enemies, didnt begin with a fitness update from Atlanta or Palm Beach; it began on Monday morning New York time with news from Paris that Kylian Mbapp had withdrawn a legal claim accusing his former club of extortion and harassment. Two days before kick-off, it was time for the football.\n\nWell, sort of. Kylian Mbapp has decided to bring an end to the criminal proceedings initiated last spring against PSG, a statement from the players camp said. The decision reflects a desire for deescalation, at a time when a new chapter is beginning. A desire too to concentrate on sport. Definitely nothing to do with their prospects of winning the case, then. Besides, the statement says: It does not affect the ongoing proceedings before the French labour court which will address the contractual and financial aspects surrounding the end of his time with PSG.\n\nThere is still the demand for 55m in allegedly unpaid wages and bonuses, which led to PSGs accounts being momentarily blocked. PSG claim Mbapp agreed to waive the 55m when he went and the club have made a counter-claim of 98m. The accusations and counter-accusations are multiple, the amounts eye-watering, the bitterness inescapable even as it is hidden behind a polite exterior.\n\nRevenge is a dish best served cold and a word overused in football, and Mbapp and PSG were always going to cross paths one day, but this time it actually applies. There is history, scores to settle. I have been at PSG a long time, Mbapp said when he left for Madrid 13 months ago. Seven years he had spent in Paris; for almost all of them, Madrid cast a shadow. In 2021 PSG fans booed him because they thought he was going to Madrid. In 2022 Madrid fans were equally angry because they found out he wasnt. In 2023 Le Parisien said he was going again, and he called them liars. In 2024, he finally went.\n\nHis future became a question of state, the pressure intense and applied from the lyse Palace and from Doha. It wasnt an easy situation; I wouldnt want anyone to go through that, he would say. When Mbapp extended his contract at PSG for the last time in 2022, there was an 180m renewal payment, a salary of 72m a year and annual, increasing loyalty bonuses, starting at 70m. That he was not convinced, maybe even that he had been coerced, or perhaps that he had played them, rapidly became apparent: this wasnt a three-year deal but two plus one and he had barely signed it when he informed them that he wouldnt be extending.\n\nPSG left him training with the reserves, sat him in the stand and tried to sell him while they could still get a fee. Madrid, though, didnt move and he resisted the threats and played again. Once he was allowed back into the fold, had talked publicly about an agreement with Nasser al-Khelaifi that would protect both parties, no matter what happened. PSGs president, meanwhile, said Mbapp would never go for free. But he left for free. In his goodbye statement, he did not mention Khelaifi.\n\nView image in fullscreen Nasser al-Khelaifi and Kylian Mbapp in 2022 with the PSG 2025 shirt that did not tell the full story. Photograph: Michel Spingler/AP\n\nPSG had lost. And then they won. The day Mbapp left, it felt like a liberation. As it turned out, PSG were liberated too. On the morning before Saturdays Club World Cup quarter-final against Bayern Munich, Khelaifi talked about a culture shift, about how there are 23, 24 warriors now, the unlike before going without saying; about how these days the star is the team, and it is the best team he has had. If it seems a bit rich to be presumptuous about that, to take pride in it as if it was a plan, when the hierarchy did all they could to keep Mbapp in Paris, it is true.\n\nAt the end of the season, an old Marca cover from one of PSGs European eliminations was inevitably dug out again, showing the France forward with the headline: If you want to win the Champions League, you know what you have to do. So he did  and PSG won it instead. The equation Mbapp leaves = PSG win is too simple, too reductionist, yet it is hard to resist. He had left PSG, the team that just couldnt win the competition, to go to the club that always seems to so that he would. Madrid were eliminated in the quarter-finals and PSG had won it. Mbapps legal team had wanted Uefa to consider whether PSG should be allowed to participate in light of the 55m claim.\n\nMbapp is PSGs all-time top scorer, with 256 goals. At Madrid he got a hat-trick in the clsico in May, another against Manchester City in the Champions League, and scored in the Copa del Rey final. He has scored 44 goals: no debutant ever got more. How can you not call him a success? How could you blame him for the shift in fortunes? And yet that clsico was lost, the Champions League ended the next round, and in the cup final Madrid were defeated too.\n\nQuick Guide English referees could oversee Club World Cup final Show England could be represented in the Club World Cup final, regardless of whether Chelsea reach the showpiece event in New Jersey. The Premier League referees Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor, and their respective assistants, have both been kept on at the inaugural expanded Fifa tournament. Taylors team, which includes Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn, officiated PSGs quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich, while Oliver has been working with Stuart Burt and James Mainwaring, with the trio appointed to Bayerns last-16 win over Flamengo. Polands Szymon Marciniak and Frances Francois Letexier, both of whom have been awarded semi-finals, the latter taking charge of Chelseas meeting with Fluminense on Tuesday, are alternative options. The final is on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium. Ben Fisher Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nHalfway through the season he said he had hit rock bottom; it was a mental thing, he said, describing missed penalties against Liverpool and Athletic as a good moment [that] changed my mentality. I couldnt do worse: I could only go upwards. I had to do more. It was a moment of: bam!, change everything. I didnt come to Madrid to play badly. By then, though, it was late and the collective malaise was irreversible.\n\nIn the meantime, the battles with PSG continued off the field, no clean break, no closure, despite the liberation. Instead, the bitterness lingered. When Mbapps claim was made public in April, his lawyers declared it time to go on the attack having tried to resolve things peacefully, seeking what they said he was owed. The behaviour had been scandalous and indecent and they wanted to send a clear message: thats enough. A PSG spokesperson told Efe those claims were a fantasy from a parallel universe.

They won the Champions League and have in Ousmane Dembl the leading candidate to win the Ballon dOr, which Mbapp had gone in search of too. When a player like me comes to a team, many things change, Mbapp had said, and not all of them were for the better. Madrid, winners of the league and Champions League without Mbapp, won nothing with him. And if it was unfair, even absurd, for him to become a symbol of Madrids failure and PSGs success, at the end of the season, as a relentless PSG team tore Inter apart, some analyses suggested that was so.\n\nOne particular scene from No Tenis Ni Puta Idea, a superb insider documentary on Luis Enrique from Mbapps final season, offered an explanation of what had happened. In it, the PSG coach sits Mbapp in front of a screen at PSGs training ground and asks him to complete the caption describing his previous performance: Cest  something. The missing word is catastrophique. He tries to get through to Mbapp by talking about his hero, the NBA legend Michael Jordan: a player who would grab his teammates by the balls and run to defend like a motherfucker.\n\nThat, Luis Enrique insists, is a leader. As an attacker youre God, I know, a phenomenon, top, he says, but thats not what I care about. If you press, its the business. If on top of that, you get Dembl, [Randal] Kolo Muani, Marcos Asensio to press, you know what we have? A team thats a fucking machine. And thats when youre Michael Jordan.\n\nLuis Enrique tells his striker: I want you to leave through the front door, Kiki, but you have to earn that. Towards the end of the series, by which time everyone else knows Mbapp is leaving and they fear the worst, when they have been denied in their pursuit of the Champions League once more, there is a moment when the coach says: Next year well be better, without doubt, because when a player goes where he wants that means there are parts of our play that I dont control. And next year I am going to control all of them. Without exception. And so it was, an extra dimension added to PSGs Champions League win by his absence and, while they wouldnt say so, their former forward winning nothing, the schadenfreude inescapable.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kylian Mbapp said his acrobatic goal against Borussia Dortmund was a good way of showing I feel good again after a stomach virus. Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Club World Cup offers a way back for Madrid and Mbapp, perhaps, one competition left, one shot at redemption, this season at least. Yet while something has been building again under the new coach, Xabi Alonso, it has been without Mbapp so far. After being in hospital with a stomach virus and losing 5kg, he has not started; in his place, Gonzalo Garca, a 21-year-old academy striker, has been a revelation. Against Dortmund, though, Mbapp came on and scored a brilliant acrobatic volley. A good way of showing I feel good again, he called it; the following day he withdrew his accusation of extortion. Over the last few weeks relations between Kylian Mbapp and the club president have significantly improved, the statement said. His father had accompanied Khelaifi in PSGs box at this competition. Now, Mbapp himself meets PSG, ready to start at last, a place in a world cup final at stake.\n\nWe were lucky this year without [Mbapp], but I also wish him the best, Khelaifi said just before this competition began, as if anyone was buying that. Even if we have a small conflict, honestly, from the bottom of my heart, I wish him the best. Except, the PSG president added, when he plays us."

        "content": "Brian Gavidia was recently targeted in a federal immigration raid at his workplace. Im American, bro! he told agents who confronted him.\n\nBrian Gavidia had stepped out from working on a car at a tow yard in a Los Angeles suburb Thursday when armed, masked men  wearing vests with Border Patrol on them  pushed him up against a metal gate and demanded to know where he was born.\n\nIm American, bro! 29-year-old Gavidia pleaded, in video taken by a friend.\n\nWhat hospital were you born? the agent barked.\n\nI dont know, dawg! he said. East L.A., bro! I can show you: I have my fing Real ID.\n\nHis friend, whom Gavidia did not name, narrated the video: These guys, literally based off of skin color! My homie was born here! The friend said Gavidia was being questioned just because of the way he looks.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said U.S. citizens were arrested because they ASSAULTED U.S. Border Patrol Agents. (McLaughlins statement emphasized the word assaulted in all-capital and boldfaced letters.)\n\nShare via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied!\n\n\n\nWhen told by a reporter that Gavidia had not been arrested, McLaughlin clarified that Gavidia had been questioned by Border Patrol agents but there is no arrest record. She said a friend of Gavidias was arrested for assault of an officer.\n\nAs immigration operations have unfolded across Southern California in the last week, lawyers and advocates say people are being targeted because of their skin color. The encounter with Gavidia and others they are tracking have raised legal questions about enforcement efforts that have swept up hundreds of immigrants and shot fear into the deeply intertwined communities they call home.\n\nAgents picking up street vendors without warrants. American citizens being grilled. Home Depot lots swept. Car washes raided. The wide-scale arrests and detainments  often in the regions largely Latino neighborhoods  contain hallmarks of racial profiling and other due process violations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Multiple immigration sweeps reported across L.A., with a tense standoff downtown Federal agents in riot gear detained workers in the Garment District in downtown Los Angeles as crowds gathered to record them and shout protests.\n\nWe are seeing ICE come into our communities to do indiscriminate mass arrests of immigrants or people who appear to them to be immigrant, largely based on racial profiling, said Eva Bitran, a lawyer at ACLU of Southern California.\n\nWhen asked about the accusations of racial profiling, the White House deflected.\n\nCalling the questions shameful regurgitations of Democrat propaganda by activists  not journalists, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson chided Times reporters Saturday for not reporting the real story  the American victims of illegal alien crime and radical Democrat rioters willing to do anything to keep dangerous illegal aliens in American communities.\n\nShe did not answer the question.\n\nMcLaughlin said in a statement, Any claims that individuals have been targeted by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said the suggestion fans the flames and puts agents in peril.\n\nDHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence, she said. We know who we are targeting ahead of time. If and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement is trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability.\n\nWe will follow the Presidents direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of Americas streets, she said.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection officers are stationed at the federal building in Los Angeles on Friday. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unprecedented show of force by federal agents follows orders from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the architect of Trumps immigration plan and a Santa Monica native, to execute 3,000 arrests a day. In May, Miller reportedly directed top ICE officials to go beyond target lists and have agents make arrests at Home Depot or 7-Eleven convenience stores.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not answer specific questions about the encounter with Gavidia and said that immigration enforcement has been targeted. The agency did not explain what is meant by targeted enforcement.\n\nBut a federal criminal complaint against Javier Ramirez, another of Gavidias friends, said Border Patrol agents were conducting a roving patrol in Montebello around 4:30 p.m. when they engaged a subject in a consensual encounter in a parking lot on West Olympic Boulevard. The complaint noted that the parking lot is fenced and gated, but that, at the time of the interaction, the gate to the parking lot was open.\n\nThe enforcement was part of a roving patrol in what John B. Mennell, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said was a lawful immigration enforcement operation in which agents also arrested without incident an immigrant without legal status.\n\nGavidia said he and Ramirez both rent space at the tow yard to fix cars.\n\nOn video captured by a security camera at the scene, the agents pull up at the open gate in a white SUV and three agents exit the car. At least one covers his face with a mask as they walk into the property and begin looking around. Shortly after, an agent can be seen with one man in handcuffs calmly standing against the fence, while Ramirez can be heard shouting and being wrestled to the ground.\n\nGavidia walks up on the scene from the sidewalk outside the business where agents are parked. Seeing the commotion, he turns around. An agent outside the business follows him and then another does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGavidia, whom Mennell identified as a third person, was detained for investigation for interference (in an enforcement operation) and released after being confirmed to be a U.S. citizen with no outstanding warrants.\n\nVideo didnt show the full story, he said in a statement.\n\nBut it is unclear from the video exactly what that interference is. And Gavidia denies interfering with any operations.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection, the agency that has played a prominent role in the recent sweeps, is also under a federal injunction in Central California after a judge found it had engaged in a pattern and practice of violating peoples constitutional rights in raids earlier this year.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino, who oversaw raids that included picking people up at Home Depot and stopping them on the highway, has emerged as a key figure in L.A. He stood alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday at a news conference where Sen. Alex Padilla  the states first Latino U.S. senator  was handcuffed, forced to the ground and briefly held after interrupting Noem with a question.\n\nA lot of bad people, a lot of bad things are in our country now, Bovino said. Thats why were here right now, is to remove those bad people and bad things, whether illegal aliens, drugs or otherwise, were here. Were not going away.\n\nBovino said hundreds of Border Patrol agents have fanned out and are on the ground in L.A. carrying out enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA federal judge for the Eastern District of California ordered Bovinos agency to halt illegal stops and warrantless arrests in the district after agents detained and arrested dozens of farmworkers and laborers  including a U.S. citizen  in the Central Valley shortly before President Trump took office.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by the United Farm Workers and Central Valley residents, accused the agency of brazen racial profiling of people in a days-long enforcement. It roiled the largely agricultural area, after video circulated of agents slashing the tires of a gardener who was a citizen on his way to work, and it raised fears that those tactics could become the new norm there.\n\nThe effort was proof of concept, David Kim, assistant chief patrol agent under Bovino, told the San Diego investigative outfit Inewsource in March. Testing our capabilities, and very successful. We know we can push beyond that limit now as far as distance goes.\n\nBovino said at the news conference that his agents were not going anywhere soon.\n\nYoull see us in Los Angeles. Youll continue to see us in Los Angeles, he said.\n\nBitran, who is working on the case in the Central Valley, said Millers orders have set loose agents with a mandate to capture as many people as possible, and that leads to them detaining people in a way that violates the Constitution.\n\nIn Montebello, a 78% Latino suburb that shares a border with East Los Angeles, Border Patrol agents took Gavidias identification. Although they eventually let him go, Ramirez, also American and a single father of two, wasnt so lucky.\n\nTomas De Jesus, Ramirezs cousin and his attorney, said authorities are accusing him of resisting arrest, assaulting people after agents barged into a private business without a warrant, without a probable cause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the reasonable suspicion for him to be accosted? De Jesus questioned. What is the probable cause for them to be entering into a private business area? ... At this moment, it seems to me like they have a blanket authority almost to do anything.\n\nRamirez has been charged in a federal criminal complaint with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer. Authorities allege that Ramirez was trying to conceal himself and then ran toward the exit and refused to answer questions about his identity and citizenship. They also allege he pushed and bit an agent.\n\nDe Jesus said Ramirez was not attempting to flee, he did not assault anyone, and he raised his hands when confronted by CBP. He added: He is the victim, not the aggressor.\n\nMontebello Mayor Salvador Melendez said hed watched the video of Gavidia being questioned and called the situation extremely frustrating.\n\nIt just seems like theres no due process, he said. Theyre going for a specific look, which is a look of our Latino community, our immigrant community. Theyre asking questions after. ... This is not the country that we all know it to be, where folks have individual rights and protections.\n\nA third individual was detained on the street for investigation for interference and released after being confirmed to be a U.S. citizen with no outstanding warrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven before the video was looping on social media feeds, Angelica Salas  who heads one of the most well-established immigration advocacy groups in Los Angeles  said she was getting reports of indiscriminate arrests and American citizens being questioned and detained.\n\nWe have U.S. citizens who are being asked for their documents and not believed when they attest to the fact that they are U.S. citizens, said Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights. They just happen to be Latino.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long held that law enforcement officers cannot detain people based on generalizations that would cast a wide net of suspicion on large segments of the law-abiding population.\n\nSome of the accounts I have heard suggest that theyre just stopping a whole bunch of people, and then questioning them all to find out which ones might be unlawfully present, said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA Law School.\n\nAn agent can ask a person about anything, he said. But if the person declines to speak, the agent cannot detain them unless they have reasonable suspicion that the individual is unlawfully here.\n\nThe 4th Amendment as well as governing immigration regulations do not permit immigration agents to detain somebody against their will, even for a very brief time, absent reasonable suspicion, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust being brown doesnt qualify. And being a street vendor or farmworker does not, either. A warrant to search for documents at a work site also is not enough to detain someone there.\n\nThe agents appear to be flagrantly violating these immigration laws, he said, all over Southern California.\n\nGavidia said the agents who questioned him in Montebello never returned his Real ID.\n\nIm legal, he said. I speak perfect English. I also speak perfect Spanish. Im bilingual, but that doesnt mean that I have to be picked out, like, This guy seems Latino; this guy seems a little bit dirty.\n\nIt was the worst experience I ever felt, Gavidia said, his voice shaking with anger as he spoke from the business Friday. I felt honestly like I was going to die.\n\nOn Saturday, Gavidia joined De Jesus in downtown L.A. for his first-ever protest.\n\nNow, he said, it felt personal.\n\nTimes staff writer Andrea Castillo contributed to this report."

        "content": "Like two first-chair musicians with differing interpretations of the same symphony, U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have not always been on the same page.\n\nBut the music was perfectly harmonious at Monday nights White House dinner between the two leaders  the prime ministers third visit to Washington in the not-yet six months of Mr. Trumps second term.\n\nThe president and prime minister lavished praise on each other  Mr. Netanyahu, relying on the effectiveness of flattery with Mr. Trump, even presented his host with a copy of his letter nominating him for a Nobel peace prize.\n\nWhy We Wrote This A story focused on Cooperation While the two leaders have made efforts to emphasize their cooperation, Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu offer different visions of Gaza and Iran. Nevertheless, the White House dinner Monday night presented a harmonious tableau.\n\nWe had tremendous success together, Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to last months joint bombing campaign on Iranian nuclear facilities, as he greeted Mr. Netanyahu before a private dinner. And I think it will only go on to be even greater success in the future.\n\nThat does not mean the two leaders are perfectly in tune, some regional and national security analysts say.\n\nTake Iran. Since the United States joined Israel in its air war aimed at destroying Irans nuclear program, Mr. Netanyahu has wanted to seize the moment of Tehrans weakness to go all the way to regime change. Not so much Mr. Trump, touting the window for a permanent deal with Iranian leaders.\n\nAnd on Gaza, President Trump has for months pressed for a peace deal for the flattened and starving Palestinian enclave based on the same model, which starts with a 60-day Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostages-prisoners swap. That first step would pave the way to a long-term governance agreement for Gaza, drawing in regional partners. But for largely domestic political reasons, Mr. Netanyahu has preferred to pursue  even intensify  the war.\n\nOded Balilty/AP Israelis rally for a ceasefire and the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip in front of the U.S. Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv, July 7, 2025, ahead of the meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBut others say that despite some flat notes, Mr. Trump has largely demonstrated  as he did again Monday night  that he takes his cue from his support for Israel.\n\nWe have seen some moments, especially early on, that suggested these two leaders maybe werent so aligned, but more recently what has been confirmed again is that the U.S. and Israel are in fact working very closely on what Trump sees are U.S. interests and how Netanyahu sees Israels interests, says Annelle Sheline, a former State Department foreign affairs officer who is now Middle East research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington.\n\nUnfortunately, I dont think Trump is ready to pressure Netanyahu in any way on anything, she says.\n\nNo Gaza breakthrough\n\nMr. Trump had suggested last week that he expected to be able to announce a Gaza deal Monday. But even though both Israel and Hamas reported positive steps in talks in Doha over the weekend, there was no breakthrough. Hamas, which seeks to preserve its remaining forces in Gaza, wants some guarantee that a deal will lead to the end of the war. Israel, still holding to its goal of removing Hamas from Gaza, seeks to reserve the right to relaunch fighting as it deems necessary.\n\nMr. Trump has shifted to saying he expects a ceasefire deal this week.\n\nThat could still potentially allow the president and prime minister to celebrate an agreement together, since Mr. Netanyahu plans to remain in Washington until Thursday. After meeting Vice President JD Vance Tuesday morning, he was set to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson next, and was expected back at the White House later in the afternoon for another meeting with the president.\n\nSupport for Mr. Netanyahu and his conduct of the war in Gaza is even more seamless among Republican members of Congress. That strong backing extends to Israels risky decision to take out Irans nuclear sites and other key locations of the Iranian military.\n\nThe Israeli leader is likely to hear music to his ears from some Republicans who think now is the time not for deals with Iran, as Mr. Trump emphasized again Monday, but to proceed to regime change.\n\nIn a pre-White-House-dinner commentary, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, an Iran hawk, said that, unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Netanyahu understands that just weakening the Iranian regime is not good enough. Israel seeks regime change in Iran, he says, initially through actions to encourage the domestic opposition to move against the ayatollahs.\n\nIndeed, when asked Monday about seeking regime change in Iran, Mr. Netanyahu said, I think its up to the people of Iran.\n\nWhat vision for Gaza?\n\nMr. Netanyahu revealed another point of misalignment with Mr. Trump in his White House comments Monday over the question of the mass relocation of Gazas population of more than 2 million Palestinians.\n\nPresident Trump has a brilliant vision, its called free choice, Mr. Netanyahu said on the relocation issue. If people want to stay they can stay, he said. Or they could choose to relocate to a different country, he said, adding that Israel and the U.S. were getting close to securing agreements with several countries ready to take in displaced Palestinians.\n\nUmit Bektas/Reuters Demonstrators gather outside the White House to protest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit in Washington, July 7, 2025.\n\nBut at the same time in Israel, officials are discussing a plan to forcibly confine the enclaves population to what Defense Minister Israel Katz calls a humanitarian city to be built on the ruins of Rafah.\n\nMr. Netanyahu said he nominated Trump for a Nobel peace prize based on his vision of securing Middle East peace through the Abraham Accords, which have advanced normalized relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors.\n\nThe Israeli leader said he expects the accords will serve as a model for further progress in regional relations. Israels relations with Syria were reportedly on the dinner discussion menu, while normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia remains the big outstanding prize.\n\nBut Mr. Netanyahu also addressed the issue of a future Palestinian state  for many, the ultimate key to a broad regional peace  in terms that seem unlikely to sit well with many Arab leaders, including the Saudis.\n\nSaying the Palestinians had a state, a Hamas state in Gaza, and look what they did with it, the Israeli leader said his country would only ever accept a peace based on a new state in which our security  the sovereign power security  always remains in our hands.\n\nAcknowledging that others will object that such is not a complete state, its not a state, he added, We dont care. ... Its not going to happen again."

        "content": "On Sunday at approximately 2 a.m. Tehran time, seven B-2 stealth aircraft attacked the Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, strikes enabled as much by the belief that Iran had this coming as the particular technology of the American bombers. A drawling President Trump put it in stark terms shortly after the operation ended. For 40 years, Iran has been saying death to America, death to Israel. They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs, with roadside bombs. That was their specialty.\n\nConvention drives coverage of Iran in the United States, from stock images of anti-American murals to the enduring menace of Iranian-backed militias. Now there is an emerging consensus that overthrowing the government in Tehran will accomplish what Israeli and U.S. missiles and air assaults have not: an end to Irans nuclear program and that countrys destabilizing aspirations for regional hegemony, not to mention an end of the oppressive Islamic Republic itself. A series of headlines , analysts and politicians have in recent days presented regime change as a natural certainty, nothing less than a magic bullet. This too is seen as Irans due .\n\nVery few of these expert voices have taken the next step by asking, Then what? Where does the magic bullet land? Sovereign imperatives await the next group to come into power. Democratic or otherwise, the government that replaces the current regime will be laser-focused on Irans survival. And there is very little reason for Israel or the U.S. to think that a reconstituted Iran will become more conciliatory toward either country once the war ends.\n\nThe reality is that nationalism , not theocracy, remains what the historian Ali Ansari calls the determining ideology of Iran. There is a robust consensus among scholars that politics in Iran begins with the idea of Iran as a people with a continuous and unbroken history, a nation that looms out of an immemorial past. Nationalism provides the broad political arena in which different groups and ideologies in Iran compete for power and authority, whether monarchist, Islamist or leftist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that means that the patriotic defense of Iran isnt a passing phase, produced under the duress of bombs, but the default position, the big idea that holds Iran together, hardened over the last two centuries of Iranian history and the trauma of the loss of territory and dignity to outside powers, including the Russians , the British and the Americans .\n\nGetting rid of Islamic rule wont change this dynamic; it is almost sure to guarantee that something worse will come along, sending Iranian politics in unexpected and more corrosive directions. Americans, after all, need only look to their current administration (or past interventions in the Middle East) for examples of how populist responses to foreign invasions, real or imagined , can lead to unthinkable outcomes .\n\nTrump just guaranteed that Iran will be a nuclear weapons state in the next 5 to 10 years, particularly if the regime changes, Trita Parsi of the U.S.-based Quincy Institute wrote Saturday night. This is especially true if a new regime is democratic. The promised liberation of the Iranian people through devastating bombing campaigns presents the worst-case scenario for Israel and the U.S., as no future elected government would survive unless it sustained, and perhaps surpassed, the Islamic Republic of Irans current belligerence.\n\nThere is tragedy here. Ordinary Iranians, like most people, want peace and security, preferably through diplomacy and dialogue. The unprovoked attacks of the last week and their subsequent justification by not only the U.S. but also nearly all of the European Union, a disastrous sequence that began with Trumps wanton violation of President Obamas Iran deal in 2018, have convinced an increasing number of Iranians that the restraint of arms, nuclear or otherwise, is national suicide.\n\nInsofar as the Islamic Republic can claim that it is the only Iranian government in more than 200 years to have lost not an inch of soil, it continues to cling to power. Of course, such legitimacy comes with a dual edge. This regime may survive in the short term, but if and when it does fall it will be because its leaders failed to keep Israeli and American arms out, munitions that have already killed more than 800 of their fellow citizens in less than a week, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.\n\nOne of the most common conventions when it comes to Iran, typically presented as a gesture of grace, is to draw a distinction between its government and the people, to lay blame on the mullahs and not the countrys long-suffering citizens for their countrys status as a rogue actor. As a way to appeal to Iranians of the righteousness of his cause, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his surrogates have deployed tropes of civilizational greatness that would make even the most ardent Persian chauvinist blush. On Thursday, the Israeli prime minister announced that the time had come for the Jews to repay an ancient debt: I want to tell you that 2,500 years ago, Cyrus the Great, the king of Persia, liberated the Jews. And today, a Jewish state is creating the means to liberate the Persian people. Regime change, by this logic, is a project of recovery and revivalism, a surefire way to make Iran great again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIranians are proving to be less nuanced, and unconvinced. The distance between the Iranian state and society has in the last week been reduced to almost nothing. Across the range of experience and suffering, from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureates and formerly imprisoned Palm DOr winners to working-class laborers left behind by the revolution, the overriding sentiment today in Iran is clear: These clerics may be scoundrels, but theyre our scoundrels, our problem to solve.\n\nNearly 50 years into an unwanted dictatorship, Iranians have developed a refined capacity for identifying bad faith. They know who has Irans interests at heart and who is trying to save his own skin ."

        "content": "Editors Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radios daily program The Dean Obeidallah Show. Follow him @DeanObeidallah@masto.ai. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN \n\nOn Monday, the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee  chaired by Donald Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan  is set to hold a field hearing in New York City called Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan. A statement bills the hearing as an examination of how, the Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Braggs policies have led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.\n\nDean Obeidallah CNN\n\nIn response, Braggs office slammed Jordans hearing as a political stunt while noting that data released by the New York Police Department shows crime is down in Manhattan with respect to murders, burglaries, robberies and more through April 2, compared with the same period last year.\n\nIn reality, this Jordan-led hearing isnt about stopping crime but about defending Trump  who was recently charged by a Manhattan grand jury with 34 felonies. Trump pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from an investigation into a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. The former president also is facing criminal probes in other jurisdictions over efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nBragg sued Jordan and his committee last week in federal court, accusing the Judiciary Committee chairman of a transparent campaign to intimidate and attack his office for its investigation and prosecution of Trump by making demands for confidential documents and testimony.\n\nWhile Jordan and his committee appear focused on discrediting the investigation into Trump, why arent they looking into two recent bombshell reports by ProPublica that raised red flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After all, the House Judiciary Committees website explains that it has jurisdiction over matters relating to the administration of justice in federal courts  for which the revelations concerning Thomas fit perfectly.\n\nFirst, we learned in early April that Crow had provided Thomas and his wife, Ginni, for decades with luxurious vacations including on the donors yacht and private jet to faraway places such as Indonesia and New Zealand. That information was never revealed to the public. (In a rare public statement, Thomas responded he was advised at the time that he did not have to report the trips. The justice said the guidelines for reporting personal hospitality have changed recently. And, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future, he said.)\n\nThen on Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomas failed to disclose a 2014 real estate deal involving the sale of three properties he and his family owned in Savannah, Georgia, to that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One of Crows companies made the purchases for $133,363, according to ProPublica. A federal disclosure law passed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices and other officials to make public the details of most real estate sales over $1,000.\n\nAs ProPublica detailed, the federal disclosure form Thomas filed for that year included a space to report the identity of the buyer in any private transaction, but Thomas left that space blank. Four ethics law experts told ProPublica that Thomas failure to report it appears to be a violation of the law. (Thomas did not respond to questions from ProPublica on its report; CNN reached out to the Supreme Court and Thomas for comment.)\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has long addressed issues such as those surrounding Thomas. In fact, the committee is where investigations and the impeachment of federal judges often commence.\n\nOne recent example came in 2010 with Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr., whom the committee investigated and recommended for impeachment.\n\nThe committees Task Force on Judicial Impeachment said evidence showed Porteous intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury, engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme, solicited and accepted unlawful gifts, and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings. The Senate later found Porteous guilty of four articles of impeachment and removed him from the bench.\n\nYet the Judiciary Committee has neither released statements nor tweets raising alarm bells about Thomas. Instead, its Twitter feed is filled with repeated tweets whining that C-SPAN wont cover Mondays New York field hearing. Worse, the committee retweeted GOP Rep. Mary Millers tweet defending Thomas as being attacked because he is a man of deep faith, who loves our country and believes in our Constitution.\n\nJordans use of his committee to assist Trump should surprise no one. The House January 6 committees report called the Ohio Republican a significant player in President Trumps efforts to overturn the election. The report detailed the lawmakers efforts to assist Trump including on January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan led a conference call in which he, President Trump, and other Members of Congress discussed strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session. As a result, the January 6 committee subpoenaed Jordan to testify  but he refused to cooperate.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn contrast with the House panel, the Senate Judiciary Committee  headed by Democrats  announced in the wake of the reporting on Thomas that it plans to hold a hearing on the need to restore confidence in the Supreme Courts ethical standards. Beyond that, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia sent a letter Friday calling for a referral of Thomas to the US attorney general over potential violations of the Ethics in Government Act 1978.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committees website notes, The Committee on the Judiciary has been called the lawyer for the House of Representatives. Under Jordan that description needs to be updated to state that the Committee on the Judiciary is now the lawyer for Donald J. Trump. And the worst part is that the taxpayers are the ones paying for Jordans work on Trumps behalf."

The KRG expanded into these disputed territories at the time when ISIL was expanding its territory, and then began to take steps to unilaterally declare that these areas were now incorporated into the Kurdistan region, including when it held the referendum that Emma talked about.\n\nIt included holding the referendum in these disputed territories. Now, so long as Iraq  so long as we're talking about a single country, it matters a little less who controls Kirkuk, but once the referendum was held, this gave rise then to the second reason for Baghdad choosing to act now.\n\nAs Emma said, Kirkuk is an important oil-producing zone in Iraq. And it is vital for the economic viability of an independent Kurdish state and an important part of the economic viability of the Iraqi state. So there was never going to be a scenario, I think, in which Baghdad would allow a unilateral exercise of control by Kurds to occur over Kirkuk, so long as independence is on the table."

Discounts and the introduction of earthquake insurance had prevented Japan-bound travel from dropping to zero, he added.\n\nHong Kong resident Branden Choi, 28, said he was a frequent traveller to Japan but was hesitant to visit the country during July and August due to the manga prediction.\n\nIf possible, I might delay my trip and go after September, he said.\n\nRyo Tatsuki, the artist behind the manga titled The Future I Saw, first published in 1999 and then re-released in 2021, has tried to dampen the speculation, saying in a statement issued by her publisher that she was not a prophet.\n\nThe first edition of the manga warned of a major natural disaster in March 2011. That was the month and year when a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster struck Japans northeastern coast, killing thousands.\n\nSome have interpreted the latest edition as predicting a catastrophic event would occur specifically on July 5, 2025, although Tatsuki has denied this.\n\nSituated within the Pacific Oceans Ring of Fire, Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In recent days, there have been more than 900 earthquakes, most of them small tremors, on islands off the southern tip of Kyushu.\n\nBut Robert Geller, a professor at the University of Tokyo who has studied seismology since 1971, said even scientifically-based earthquake prediction was impossible.\n\nNone of the predictions Ive experienced in my scientific career have come close at all, he said.\n\nNevertheless, low-cost carrier Greater Bay Airlines became the latest Hong Kong airline on Wednesday to cancel flights to Japan due to low demand, saying it would indefinitely suspend its service to Tokushima in western Japan from September.\n\nSerena Peng, 30, a visitor to Tokyo from Seattle, had initially tried to talk her husband out of visiting Japan after seeing the social media speculation.\n\nIm not super worried right now, but I was before, she said, speaking outside Tokyos bustling Senso-ji temple."

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017\n\nIt was Sanders job during Wednesdays press briefing to make sense of Trumps political response to the tragedy on the last day of October after refusing to politicize a tragedy after a gunman opened fire on a Las Vegas concert on the first day of the month. All the White House press secretary could do, however, was mislead the press about what Trump had said.\n\nSarah Sanders is currently arguing that the White House isnt politicizing the attack in NYC.

Schumer & doesnt feel that the senator is responsible for the attack.  Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) November 1, 2017\n\nAs even Republican Sen. Jeff Flake pointed out, Schumer was actually part of a Gang of Eight that attempted to do away with the visa application in question.\n\nActually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms. I know, I was there https://t.co/QQFJzPyRzC  Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 1, 2017\n\nSanders also got the basics about the program Trump has proposed to eliminate wrong.\n\nThe fact that we have a lottery system that randomly decides who gets the greatest opportunity in the world  And to give that away randomly, to have no vetting system, to have no way to determine who comes, why theyre here, and if they want to contribute to society is a problem, she said to defend Trumps call to end the Diversity Visa lottery.\n\nBut as reporters in the room pointed, an immigrant selected through the lottery program is vetted by the State Department. When Sanders wasnt lying Wednesday about Trumps erroneous beliefs on immigration, she was refusing to condemn slavery.\n\nWHs Sanders: im not going to re-litigate Civil War. disgusting and absurd to suggest anyone inside this building would support slavery  John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) November 1, 2017\n\nAnd continued the White House tradition of whining about the press:"

More than 100 people have been confirmed dead, including 87 in Kerr County.\n\nLocal, state and federal emergency responders are combing through fallen trees and other debris that littered the hard-hit Texas Hill Country communities  all with the desperate hope of finding survivors.\n\nBut that possibility seemed like a long shot.\n\nJonathan Lamb of the Kerrville Police Department told reporters Tuesday morning that he believes that the last live rescue took place on Friday.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nResponders are dealing with \"extremely difficult\" terrain due to the massive piles of debris, according to Lt. Col. Ben Baker from the Texas Game Wardens, who spoke alongside Kerr County officials.\n\n\"When we're trying to make these recoveries, these large piles can be very obstructive, and to get in deep into these piles is very hazardous,\" Baker said. Specialized rescue teams \"have to go in there, layer by layer. It's extremely treacherous, time consuming. It's dirty work.\" Officials told reporters Tuesday that it's not clear how many people remain missing.\n\nThe Guadalupe River rose more than 26 feet in less than an hour early Friday morning. Camp Mystic, an all-girls' Christian summer camp located on the banks of the river, said Monday that it lost at least 27 campers and counselors. As of Tuesday, Kerr County officials said five campers and one counselor were still unaccounted for.\n\nAs recovery efforts continue, questions have also mounted over what local officials in Kerr County could have done to warn or evacuate residents and visitors in the area known as \"Flash Flood Alley.\"\n\nKerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha and other officials faced tense questioning from reporters asking what their specific actions and discussions were in the early morning hours of Friday and when they became aware flooding was a serious threat.\n\nLeitha said he was first notified of a number of 911 calls at around 4 or 5 a.m. on Friday. He did not go into detail, saying that in due time officials would put a timeline together about what happened and when. But he said, \"I've told you several times that is not my priority this time.\" He said his priority is finding the deceased, identifying them and notifying their families.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLeitha did not answer a direct question about which city official was in charge of monitoring the storm information and who would have made the ultimate decision to call for evacuations.\n\nBaker, with the Texas Game Wardens, stepped in when reporters continued asking questions of Leitha and said, \"We understand you have many questions. We understand that. But right now, this team up here is focused on bringing people home. That's our focus.\"\n\nOfficials have also said they are reviewing whether cell and radio service in the area were adequate to warn people."

        "content": "On Saturday, President Donald Trump brought the United States into Israels war against Iran. American planes and submarines struck three sites in Iran, including two nuclear enrichment facilitiesat Natanz and Fordowand a complex near Isfahan that was believed to contain stores of uranium. The Israeli government had been pushing for Trump to strike, in part because the Fordow site was believed to be reachable only with American aircraft and weaponry. Prior to Israels attack on Iran, which began a little more than a week ago, Trump had repeatedly stated that he wanted to make a nuclear deal with Iran, despite, in his first term, having pulled the U.S. out of Barack Obamas nuclear deal with the country.\n\nOn Saturday night, in a televised address, Trump claimed that the three sites were completely and totally obliterated, and said that Iran must now make peace, warning of more attacks if they did not. The actual extent of the damage is not yet known, nor is it clear if and how Iran will retaliate. (Trump had announced on Thursday that the decision on whether to strike would be made within two weeks and that there remained a possibility of negotiation.)\n\nLate on Saturday, I spoke by phone with James M. Acton, the chair and co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why even a successful strike might do less damage to the Iranian nuclear program than the Trump Administration hopes it will, whether the action could lead to a larger conflict with Iran, and why Trumps decision to pull out of Obamas nuclear deal wrecked the best chance to curtail Irans nuclear program.\n\nWhat are your first impressions of what happened tonight?\n\nIm kind of appalled, to be honest, as an American citizenappalled that the President would start military action without congressional authorization. Thats my immediate reaction. But, as a nuclear-policy analyst, Im very worried that this is the beginning of a prolonged conflict, not the end of one.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nIn a lot of the coverage I have been seeing, and in a lot of the advocacy for what President Trump ended up doing tonight, there has been the impression that this would be a one-and-done thingthe President would authorize a strike, Fordow would be destroyed, the Iranian nuclear program would be ended, and it would be a very quick, completely decisive military intervention. Theres two reasons why I think thats wrong. The first one is immediate Iranian retaliation. Iran has many short-range ballistic missiles that can reach American bases and American assets in the region. Israel has not particularly targeted that infrastructure. Its been primarily focussed on Irans longer-range missiles that can reach Israel. So Im expecting to see some pretty dramatic attempted retaliation by Iran, and I think that puts enormous pressure on the President to respond again. That is the first pathway to immediate escalation in the short term.\n\nIn the slightly longer term, I believe its very likely that Irans going to reconstitute its nuclear program. I think Iran is likely to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (N.P.T.) and thus kick out inspectors. The N.P.T. prohibits non-nuclear-weapon states, such as Iran, from acquiring nuclear weapons, and requires them to accept International Atomic Energy Agency (I.A.E.A.) safeguards, such as inspections, to verify that commitment. That puts us in the position where an American President or Israel might start striking Iran again and again.\n\nI dont want to speculate about exactly how successful these strikes were, but, if the strikes did what Trump has claimed, how much of a blow would that be to the Iranian nuclear program?\n\nMy answer may be a slightly unsatisfactory one, but it depends on how much else is destroyed. There are two key things that worry me. The issue is not just destroying fixed sites. Iran also had a bunch of highly enriched uranium that was once believed to be stored in tunnels underneath Isfahan. And the Iranians have claimed that theyve removed that material. And then, secondly, theres a whole bunch of components for building centrifuges that were being monitored when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J.C.P.O.A.) was enforced and are now no longer being monitored.\n\nThe J.C.P.O.A. is the 2015 nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the Obama Administration, and which exchanged a lessening of sanctions on Iran for nuclear inspections and limits on enrichment, and which Trump pulled out of in 2018.\n\nExactly. If the highly enriched uranium and the centrifuge components are small, that means that theyre portable. They can be moved around the country; they can be hidden. So, if what the U.S. has done is destroy the big sites that we know about, the enrichment facilities, but hasnt destroyed the highly enriched uranium and the centrifuge components, I think Iran can probably reconstitute relatively quickly, perhaps within one or two years. Its very hard to put an exact time on this. If the operations have managed to destroy some of the highly enriched uranium, or all of the highly enriched uranium, and the centrifuge components, then the reconstitution timeline is likely to be longer. What I would point out is that under any scenario the reconstitution timeline is going to be much shorter than the ten to fifteen years of the J.C.P.O.A. Thats how long the deal was supposed to last for. It is also worth pointing out that people argue that the J.C.P.O.A. was a bad deal because it only lasted that long. Even that was a bit misleading.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause some parts of the J.C.P.O.A. lasted twenty years, some lasted twenty-five years, some actually were indefinite. It was actually quite a complicated arrangement, the way the J.C.P.O.A. phased out over time. Limits on enrichment and uranium-stockpile sizes lasted ten or fifteen years. The I.A.E.A.s right to monitor centrifuge components lasted twenty years. The prohibition against weaponization activities had no time limits. But, even under the ten to fifteen years that was often quoted, were now likely dealing with a reconstitution timeline under any scenario thats substantially shorter than that.\n\nA central point you have made, which I have seen you make in the past, is that the alternative to this strike and the Israeli action was not nothing but was in fact the deal that Trump exited in 2018. Was that deal succeeding?\n\nI think the J.C.P.O.A. was working very well. The U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was complying with the deal. Irans program was heavily limited, and it was heavily inspected. To my mind, it was working very well when Trump pulled out. And I do think there was a slim but real opportunity for diplomacy over the past few days. Obviously, there was no possibility of reconstituting the J.C.P.O.A. But you had this interesting situation where Israel had started an attack; it couldnt destroy everything in Iran, including but not limited to Fordow, and the American threats gave Trump some leverage. And Trump at times appeared interested in trying to use that leverage to negotiate. I do feel there was some kind of window for diplomacy there. Im just very sad that that window was never taken, and there wasnt a good-faith attempt to try and take advantage of it.\n\nThe lack of good faith was from Trump, or from the Iranians, too?\n\nWe dont know. But what I would point out is that a serious negotiation cant be done in forty-eight hours or however long it was since Trump announced that he was going to give the opportunity for diplomacy. He said this week that he would make a decision within two weeks. So my feeling is that there was never any real attempt on the part of the U.S. to follow up on that and actually try to negotiate some kind of diplomatic settlement here."

        "content": "A woman tries to avoid a swarm of lovebugs on the summit of Gyeyang Mountain in Incheon, South Korea, on June 30.\n\nThey are dive-bombing pedestrians, carpeting hiking trails and making national headlines.\n\nKnown as lovebugs, or Plecia longiforceps, this species of invasive march fly is the talk of South Koreas capital, annoying the public and flummoxing government officials, who are trying to keep these uninvited summer guests  as they have been called by the media  at bay.\n\nThey are referred to as lovebugs because they are often seen in the act of mating, with males and females attached at the hip as they fly around. They began appearing in the capital area in 2015, and some experts believe they crossed over from southeastern China.\n\nWhy their populations are exploding this year is still a mystery, according to Shin Seung-gwan, a biologist at Seoul National University who is researching the phenomenon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the media is citing climate change as the reason, Shin says this explanation fails to account for one important detail: They are concentrated in the areas near Seoul, not the warmer regions of the country further south.\n\nI think, more than climate change, it may have more to do with the urban heat island effect [occurring when a city has much warmer temperatures than the surrounding area], he said. But the scale of the current population surge certainly isnt normal and is something that warrants further observation.\n\nLovebugs are harmless to humans; they dont bite, nor do they carry disease. According to one YouTuber who recently collected a bagful and consumed them in the form of a hamburger-like patty, they are even edible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flavor isnt A-tier but I think you can eat them, he said in a video detailing the experience. They taste like the unique scent they give off in the mountains. They taste like trees.\n\nTheir only sin, as things stand, is arousing disgust.\n\nThe only insects more reviled by Seoul residents are cockroaches and bedbugs, according to a survey conducted by local data company Embrain last year. Eighty-six percent of respondents said they viewed them as pests.\n\nResident complaints about lovebugs to the city more than doubled between 2022 and 2024, from 4,418 to 9,296, according to government data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo ubiquitous is this loathing that conservative lawmaker Ahn Cheol-soo recently summoned a lovebug metaphor to criticize liberal President Lee Jae-myungs latest Cabinet-level hire, a former provincial governor who was convicted for his involvement in a political scandal in 2019.\n\nMuch like lovebugs, ex-convicts seem to have a way of sticking with other ex-convicts, Ahn wrote on social media.\n\nLast year, some argued that the city should officially designate lovebugs as pests  a move that would allow them to be chemically exterminated  citing the threats they posed to mental health. But municipal legislators ultimately abandoned that idea after environmental activists raised concerns about health and safety.\n\nThis year, as public patience wears thin, the city is trying a different tack: a PR campaign to gloss up the public image of lovebugs.\n\nLovebugs, they arent pests! Excessive pest control only ends up hurting the environment and our health and should be avoided as much as possible, said one animated video posted by the Seoul governments health department last month.\n\nDespite their disgusting appearance, lovebugs provide environmental benefits, too, the video notes: The adults pollinate flowers, while the larvae aid the natural composting of soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough research is still being done into their broader ecological impacts, Shin, the biologist, says that like many invasive species, lovebugs may find their own benign place in the natural order.\n\nIn the process of organisms adapting to a new environment, its common for their populations to explode in the absence of natural enemies, he said. But over time, those natural enemies or pathogens appear, and their population density decreases.\n\nSuch was the case for another once-maligned invasive insect: the spotted lanternfly.\n\nBelieved to have entered South Korea as stowaways on agricultural imports from southeastern China, they swarmed urban areas and destroyed crops until their populations began stabilizing with the emergence of a natural enemy: a parasitic wasp that kills its eggs.\n\n"

        "content": "In an open letter to James Woods published on Teen Vogue, actor and director Amber Tamblyn accused her fellow performer of attempting to seduce her when she was 16. The letter comes after a short Twitter war between Woods, Tamblyn and actor Armie Hammer\n\nThe conflagration began on September 10, when Woods, whose conservatism is well publicized, criticized Hammers upcoming film, Call Me by Your Name. In the film, Hammer plays a 24-year-old who enters into a romantic relationship with a 17-year-old young man. Woods tweeted, As they quietly chip away the last barriers of decency, hashtagging NAMBLA in reference to the North American Man/Boy Love Association, the controversial pedophile and pederasty advocacy organization. Theres no word on whether or not Woods would have a problem with the movie if it featured a heterosexual couple of a significant age difference.\n\nAs they quietly chip away the last barriers of decency. #NAMBLA https://t.co/WqAnYxB604  James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) September 11, 2017\n\nHammer responded the following day, tweeting, Didnt you date a 19 year-old when you were 60?\n\nDidn't you date a 19 year old when you were 60.?  Armie Hammer (@armiehammer) September 11, 2017\n\nHammer is about 95 percent right here: Woods began dating 19-year-old Ashley Madison in 2007 when he was 59, not 60 (big difference, we know). The pair split in 2013, and he then struck up with 20-year-old Kristen Bauguess. He was 66.\n\nTamblyn chimed in to say that Woods had tried to pick her up in a diner parking lot when she was 16, even posting a screenshot of a text with a friend who was with her that night, corroborating the story.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/ambertamblyn/status/907331400713478144\n\nhttp://twitter.com/ambertamblyn/status/907610618353434624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teenvogue.com%2Fstory%2Famber-tamblyn-open-letter-james-woods\n\nWoods immediately connected this to a liberal attack on his conservatism while accusing Tamblyn of lying. Swell.\n\nAll this inspired Tamblyn to write a powerful letter addressed to Woods, which was published by Teen Vogue. In it, Tamblyn addresses Woods defensiveness in earnest and indelibility, calling it a teachable moment, before going into personal detail of the night in question. Since youve now called me a liar, I will now call you a silencer. I see your gaslight and now will raise you a scorched earth, she says.\n\nTamblyns detailed account of the encounter includes the honest admission that Woods probably didnt know who she was. She was just another girl, which is how Tamblyn connects her personal story to the narrative of sexual aggressiveness toward underage women. She then points out that survivors are often asked to give proof of an event that was only witnessed by the aggressor and the victim.\n\nThe saddest part of this story, she writes, doesnt even concern me but concerns the universal womans story. The nations harmful narrative of disbelieving women first, above all else. Asking them to first corroborate or first give proof or first make sure were not misremembering or first consider the consequences of speaking out or first let men give their side or first just let your sanity come last.\n\nTamblyn wraps up by asking Woods to take a good look at himself. So it is with hope, Mr. Woods, that I ask you to go inward now and ask yourself the hard stuff. The ominous unconscious stuff . . . The archetypal masculinity stuff . . . The ids most cherished stuff. Even so, Tamblyn isnt hopeful about his rehabilitation. Are you and your history with women and girls a part of the problem, Mr. Woods?, she asks. Go now and look in the mirror and ask yourself if this is true. Go on, Ill wait. But I wont hold my breath.\n\nWoods has yet to respond."

Although it can be difficult to attribute a single weather event to climate change, experts told the AP that a warming atmosphere and oceans due to the burning of fossil fuels make catastrophic storms more likely.\n\n\n\nThats because the atmosphere can hold 7 per cent more water for every degree Celsius (1.8 degrees F), creating a giant sponge of sorts that sucks up moisture from bodies of water and vegetation. The moisture later falls back to earth in increasingly intense, unpredictable and destructive downpours.\n\n\n\nIts just loading the dice toward heavy rainfall when the situation is right, said Kenneth Kunkel, a climate scientist at North Carolina State University, told the AP.

Share Updated at 12.06 EDT\n\n43m ago 11.41 EDT NBC News has more on the heated press briefing just now, during which officials faced accusations of ducking questions from reporters regarding Kerr countys alert system. Sheriff Larry Leitha told reporters that the county is working on a timeline of how it alerted residents about the flash floods. Responding to a question about the alerts, he said: As Ive told you several times, that is not my priority this time. There are three priorities, thats locating the people out there, identifying, notifying the next of kin  that is what Im taking as my job as sheriff. When a reporter pressed him on a response, asking if the emergency manager was awake during flooding and push[ed] the button to issue an emergency alert, Leitha said: Its not that easy. Its not that easy as you just push a button, OK, theres a lot more to that, and weve told you several times. Reporters continued to ask about the countys alert system, but officials evaded the questions to focus on recovery efforts.

Asked whether the emergency manager was awake at the time to issue an emergency alert, the sheriff said: I cant tell you at this time. There is then much back-and-forth over the question of who was in charge of the emergency operations center receiving monitoring briefings from the National Weather Service and who would have made the decision to evacuate. Questions are cut off to focus on recovery and rescue efforts.

The team traveled from Acua, in the state of Coahuila, which borders Del Ro, Texas, and includes nine members from the civil protection and fire department of Ciudad Acua and four members from the Fundacin 911 organization. The team told CBS News they were committed to staying until the last victim was found. Jesus Gomez, a dual citizen from Acua who also answered the call for help, said: Theres a bunch of firefighters that have visas and we were like, Lets just go and help. Sometimes people from the other side cross and help us. Its time to give a little bit. The US ambassador to Mexico, Ronald Johnson, thanked the rescuers for their help and collaboration in the area. He wrote on X: The United States and Mexico are united, not only as neighbors but as family, especially in times of need. Mexican canine teams, trained with US support for security missions, are also in Texas, Johnson said. We reiterate our commitment to working together with Mexico at times like this. Share Updated at 10.15 EDT\n\n3h ago 09.46 EDT Staff cuts at a local National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather forecast office may have been contributed to the inability of local emergency managers to respond to rising flood waters on Friday in a timely manner, former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad has told CNN. As we reported yesterday, the position of warning coordination meteorologist at the Austin-San Antonio weather forecast office  a role that serves as a direct link between forecasters and emergency managers  was vacant on 4 July, after that person took early retirement recently offered by the Trump administration. Spinrad told CNN: The staffing was just fine  and the White House has concurred with this  to get the forecast out, to get the watches and warnings issued. But when you send a message, theres no guarantee its being received, so someone needs to follow up, and thats the warning coordination meteorologist, a position that was vacant.

And as of early this morning, all flood watches have been dropped for Texas, but a few flood warnings remain in effect. Those flood warnings include the Leon River at Gatesville affecting Coryell county, Cowhouse Creek near Pidcoke, and the San Saba River affecting San Saba county, according to the National Weather Service.

        "content": "Acres burned\n\nUS wildfires are measured in terms of acres. While the size of a wildfire doesnt necessarily correlate to its destructive impact, acreage provides a way to understand a fires footprint and how quickly it has grown.\n\nThere are 2.47 acres in a hectare, and 640 acres in a square mile, but this can be hard to visualise. Here are some easy comparisons: one acre equates to roughly the size of an American football field. Londons Heathrow airport is about 3,000 acres. Manhattan covers roughly 14,600 acres, while Chicago is roughly 150,000 acres, and Los Angeles is roughly 320,000 acres.\n\nMegafire\n\nA megafire is defined by the National Interagency Fire Center as a wildfire that has burned more than 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares).\n\nContainment level\n\nA wildfires containment level indicates how much progress firefighters have made in controlling the fire. Containment is achieved by creating perimeters the fire cant move across. This is done through methods such as putting fire retardants on the ground, digging trenches, or removing brush and other flammable fuels.\n\nContainment is measured in terms of the percentage of the fire that has been surrounded by these control lines. A wildfire with a low containment level, such as 0% or 5%, is essentially burning out of control. A fire with a high level of containment, such as 90%, isnt necessarily extinguished but rather has a large protective perimeter and a rate of growth that is under control.\n\nEvacuation orders and warnings\n\nEvacuation warnings and orders are issued by officials when a wildfire is causing imminent danger to peoples life and property. According to the California office of emergency services, an evacuation warning means that it's a good idea to leave an area or get ready to leave soon. An evacuation order means that you should leave the area immediately.\n\nRed flag warning\n\nA red flag warning is a type of forecast issued by the National Weather Service that indicates when weather conditions are likely to spark or spread wildfires. These conditions typically include dryness, low humidity, high winds and heat.\n\nPrescribed burn\n\nA prescribed burn, or a controlled burn, is a fire that is intentionally set under carefully managed conditions in order to improve the health of a landscape. Prescribed burns are carried out by trained experts such as members of the US Forest Service and Indigenous fire practitioners. Prescribed burns help remove flammable vegetation and reduce the risk of larger, more catastrophic blazes, among other benefits.\n\nPrescribed burning was once a common tool among Native American tribes who used good fire to improve the land, but was limited for much of the last century by a US government approach based on fire suppression. In recent years, US land managers have returned to embracing the benefits of prescribed burns, and now conduct thousands across the country every year."

        "content": "SARWORLOR, Liberia  Five months ago, Roseline Phay, a 32-year-old farmer from the West African nation of Liberia, set off on a quest to find contraceptives.\n\nPhay and her partner have two daughters, and they barely make ends meet. Determined not to have more children, she went to a health worker in her village, but contraception pills, implants and condoms had run out. Phay trekked for hours on red clay roads to the nearest clinic, but they had no contraceptives either.\n\nShe did not know it, but her mission was doomed from the beginning. Just weeks before, U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly suspended most foreign aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which paid for medications in Liberias public clinics.\n\nTenacious and outspoken, Phay repeated the trip four times. Then she got pregnant.\n\nIm suffering, she said, with daughter Pauline crying in her arms. I have this little child on my back, and the other child in my stomach is suffering. She must continue farming throughout her pregnancy, she said, or I will not eat.\n\nAfter she got pregnant she had to wean Pauline off breastfeeding, she said, and the girl became so badly malnourished that she almost died. The U.S. cuts left no therapeutic food to give her, and she is still ill.\n\nA health officer at the Palala Clinic on June 13 in Bong County, Liberia, looks at an almost-empty shelf that once held contraceptives. Annie Risemberg / AP\n\nPhay is among millions across Africa who have seen their lives upended after the U.S. aid cuts. In Liberia, the American support made up almost 2.6% of the gross national income, the highest percentage anywhere in the world, according to the Center for Global Development.\n\nThe impact of USAID in Liberia cannot be overstated, said Richlue O. Burphy, who worked for USAID projects for over a decade and manages the National Lottery, a government body. Everywhere you go, you see the USAID (signs). And almost all the government institutions ... had some kind of USAID partnership.\n\nThe sense of betrayal runs deep in Liberia, established in the early 1800s with the aim of relocating freed slaves and free-born Black people from the United States. The political system is modeled on that of the U.S., along with its flag. Liberians often refer to the U.S. as their big brother.\n\nLiberia was one of the first countries to receive USAID support, starting in 1961. Its officials thought they would be spared from Trumps cuts because of the countries close relationship.\n\nThe C.B. Dunbar Hospital in Gbarnga, Bong County, Liberia, stands empty, on June 13. Annie Risemberg / AP\n\nFollowing civil wars and an Ebola epidemic, Liberias survival has depended largely on foreign aid, mainly from the U.S. and the World Bank. Despite abundant natural wealth, six out of 10 Liberians live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and Liberia is among the worlds 10 poorest nations.\n\nThe aid cuts pose a serious challenge, especially for the healthcare system, Deputy Finance Minister Dehpue Y. Zuo, responsible for drafting the development budget, told The Associated Press. To make sure the system stays afloat, he said, we have to take a dramatic switch to see where we will be cutting funding for other areas.\n\nLiberia received an average of $527.6 million in aid annually between 2014 and 2023, according to the finance ministry. This year, Liberia was supposed to receive $443 million, but the total estimated impact of the cuts is $290 million  essentially what hadnt been disbursed yet.\n\nUSAID funding built schools and health clinics, provided training for teachers and doctors and gave scholarships for study in the U.S. It supported small-scale farmers and paid for school meals.\n\nBut most of the U.S. funding went to Liberias health system, making up 48% of its budget. It funded malaria control, maternal health programs, HIV/AIDS treatment and community health programs. It financed hundreds of health projects run by aid groups.\n\nNow in Bong county, where Phay lives, medicine shelves in health clinics are almost empty. The USAID-funded ambulance cannot function because there is no money for fuel. Hospitals are running out of hand sanitizer and gloves. Training for medical staff has stopped, and community health workers have not been paid in months.\n\nAn empty community meeting room in Bong County, Liberia, on June 14. Annie Risemberg / AP\n\nMoses K. Banyan, head of the nearby CB Dunbar Hospital, described the U.S. cuts as beyond a shock. He worried about the future, especially now that Bong county has begun to see a handful of mpox cases spread from neighboring Sierra Leone.\n\nWarning of the cuts could have helped in finding options, he said. But its like you were sleeping, you woke up and you were told: Hey, leave this house.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. support is an opportunity for others, especially China, experts and officials said. Chinese companies have been operating Liberias gold mines, building roads and training aid workers. Chinese beer is sold alongside local brands. Many Liberians who would have sent children to universities in the U.S. are now choosing China.\n\nLast month, China opened a cardiology wing in the capitals main hospital, which is named after John F. Kennedy but was commonly referred to as Just For Killing because of its scarce resources, even before the U.S. cuts.\n\nThere are gaps to be filled, and that cannot be covered by the government of Liberia, said Zuo, the deputy finance minister. We are open door to the rest of the world, including the United States.\n\nIn Phays village of Sarworlor, community health worker Alice Togbah still wears her USAID vest though she hasnt been paid in months. She has no more malaria medication for children. She is running out of cough medicine and diarrhea treatment.\n\nA 4-year-old resident, Promise, got malaria a few days ago. Her mother, Grace Morris, obtained only a limited number of malaria tablets at the nearest clinic because of the U.S. cuts. Now they are finished, and the child still feels ill.\n\nChildren die from malaria here, she said. Last year, her neighbors son died because he did not get medication on time.\n\nGbango Kemu, 36, who got pregnant after failing to get access to contraceptives, at home in Bong County, Liberia, on June 13. Annie Risemberg / AP\n\nMorris and other women also seek contraceptives. Liberia in recent years made strides in bringing down teenage pregnancy rates and maternal mortality rates.\n\nFor women in traditional, conservative communities, access to contraceptives meant reclaiming some control over their lives.\n\nIf ... my man touches me, I cannot say no because I need to satisfy him, Phay said. But if I have no medicine, I will get pregnant.\n\nHer 9-year-old daughter, also named Promise, is living in the capital, Monrovia, with her aunt. Phay wants her to finish school and have a different life from hers.\n\nI am begging, if you people have the medicine, you people need to help us, she said. I dont want her to suffer like me."

        "content": "President Donald Trump was 3,000 miles away from the Academy Awards on Sunday night, but his presence loomed larger in the Dolby Theatre than anyone else in the room. From Jimmy Kimmels opening monologue to acceptance speeches to the ads punctuating the ceremony, it felt at times like the Oscars were more focused on delivering an extremely public rebuke to Trump than they were on celebrating the art of filmmaking.\n\nThe question is how effective such forms of protest are, in a media environment in which more than half of Americans think the press is too critical of the current president. Kimmel was one of the few personalities in the room who mentioned Trump; others largely chose to subtweet, without saying his name. While jabs about the president and his Twitter fixation made for easy punchlines, the most cutting and memorable moments of the night were the ones that elected to show, not tellto reveal how Trumps policies stand in direct opposition to the spirit of art in general and film in particular.\n\nTrump was an irresistible target for Kimmel, who laid into the one-time Oscar presenter right from the start. This broadcast is being watched live by millions of Americans, he quipped, and around the world in more than 225 countries that now hate us. He was briefly earnest, compelling everyone watching to reach out to one person they disagree with and have a positive, considerate conversation, not as liberals or conservativessomething that, he affirmed, could truly make America great again. But then it was back to business as usual: thanking Homeland Security for letting the French actress Isabelle Huppert into the country, pointing to Andrew Garfields drastic weight loss for a role as proof that Hollywood discriminates not against nationality, but against age and weight. An extended gag lampooning Meryl Streeps uninspiring and overrated performances seemed directly ripped from Trumps own critique of the actress after the Golden Globes.\n\nThe second award presented, for makeup and hairstyling, went to Alessandro Bertolazzi, Giorgio Gregorini, and Christopher Nelson for Suicide Squad. Im an immigrant. I come from Italy, Bertolazzi said, accepting the award. I work around the world and this is for all the immigrants. His sentiments were echoed in more specific terms by the Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who won best foreign-language film for The Salesman, but elected not to attend the ceremony in protest of Trumps immigration ban on seven majority-Muslim countries. His award was accepted by the Iranian American astronaut Anousheh Ansari, who read Farhadis statement aloud. Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fears, she read, with Farhadi calling out the inhumane immigration law earlier this year. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others. An empathy which we need today more than ever.\n\nOne presenter, too, took the opportunity to put a human face on Trumps policies. The actor Gael Garcia Bernal, co-presenting the award for best animated feature, slipped in a quick statement, saying, As a Mexican, as a Latin-American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, Im against any form of wall that separates us. And last years winner for best supporting actor, Mark Rylance, briefly pondered how actors and filmmakers might work to unite Americans. Oppositions great in film and stories, its wonderful in sport, its really good in society, he said. The things these films made me remember and think about was the difficultysomething women seem to be better at than menof opposing without hatred.\n\nBut Kimmels well of Trump jokes never ran dry. The Marvel movie Doctor Strange wasnt just nominated for visual effects, it was also named secretary of housing and urban development. Introducing the Academys president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, Kimmel noted how refreshing it was to have a president who believes in arts and sciences. At one point, noting Trumps Twitter silence during the ceremony, Kimmel had his phone projected onto a screen at the back of the stage, and tweeted, Hey @RealDonaldTrump u up? at the president, followed by the hashtag #merylsayshi.\n\nThis was trolling on an expert level, with its purpose solely to belittle Trump, and to remind him that hes more in disrepute in Hollywood than ever before. Its cathartic, perhaps, but it comes from a place of powertheres not much the president can do that directly threatens the film industry. But he can, for instance, defund the NEA, which has a long history of helping projects (such as the 2012 drama Beasts of the Southern Wild) and artists who later ascend to Academy glory. Pointing out the presidents personal failings will almost certainly lead to viral tweets, but pinpointing how his policies damage the arts and entertainment industries might have a more profound impact in the long run.\n\nThe most powerful moments of the ceremony, in the end, were the ones that illuminated the people excluded by the presidents policies. Accepting the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for Moonlight, also the best-picture winner, Barry Jenkins had a message for the people the movie was made for. For all you people out there who feel there is no mirror for you, he said, that you feel your life is not reflected, the Academy has your back, the ACLU has your back, we have your back, and for the next four years ... we will not forget you. In one of the most remarkable Oscar acceptance speeches of all time, Viola Davis explained her mission for making art. You know, there is one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered and thats the graveyard, she said. People ask me all the timewhat kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola? And I say exhume those bodies. Exhume those storiesthe stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition, people who fell in love and lost.\n\nIts this kind of message that seems poised to have the most impact over the next four years. For one thing, President Trumpfor onceseemed remarkably resistant to all the trolling happening onstage. Some of you will get to come up here on this stage tonight and give a speech that the president of the United States will tweet about in all caps during his 5 a.m. bowel movement tomorrow, Kimmel said at one point. As yet, though, theres been no such response."

Here's what it takes to plug them up\n\ntoggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n\nMaria Burns watched with satisfaction as a three-story-high drilling rig made a racket in her front yard.\n\nNormally, the loudest thing on this residential street in Ashland, Ohio, would be the barking of dogs  Burns runs a grooming business out of her home. But the heavy equipment operating was so noisy it was hard to talk.\n\nThe rig was there at Burns' request  and the state of Ohio's expense  to solve a problem that dates back more than a century. There's an old natural gas well in this yard, extending nearly a half-mile underground. It's long defunct, plugged 70 years ago.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut while old wells might be forgotten, they never go away. After decades, this plugged well started to leak.\n\n\"Grass didn't grow,\" Burns said. \"The pine trees kept dying. And there was another tree that sat there, and it died.\"\n\nLeaks from defunct oil and gas wells are a problem for more than just plant life. The chemicals that leach up from deep underground, including benzene and arsenic, can harm human health and leach into water reservoirs. And any remaining natural gas that works its way into the atmosphere contributes to global warming. Natural gas is almost entirely composed of methane, a greenhouse gas that's far more potent than carbon dioxide.\n\nMillions of oil and gas wells have been drilled in the U.S. since the oil industry was launched in the 1800s. A small number of those might conceivably be repurposed for something else  making geothermal power, for instance. But the vast majority will someday need to be plugged.\n\nDoing that properly is neither easy nor cheap. And if plugging isn't done properly, it might not last  as Burns discovered.\n\nThis story is the third in a three-part series on aging oil wells. Click here to read the first story, on why operators keep trying to squeeze a profit out of marginal oil wells. Click here to read the second story, on the quest to find abandoned oil wells.\n\nBurns, 79, was a little girl in the 1950s when this well outside her family home was plugged for the first time. She remembers watching the workers as they poured cement into the hole in the ground.\n\nLast fall, she was watching as that work was ripped out of the ground and done again from scratch.\n\n\"I'll be glad to get it done, over with,\" Burns said. \"And never have to worry about it again.\"\n\ntoggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n\nWhat lies beneath\n\nAt ground level on Maria Burns' street, you see the present day: a quiet neighborhood, with a modest church and a handful of houses.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nStart drilling underground, and in a way, you travel into the past. Through the soil created by centuries of decomposing plant life, through rocks ground down by shifting rivers and slowly moving mountains. Eventually, you reach the sandstone that formed hundreds of millions of years ago, when present-day Ohio was covered by a shallow sea.\n\nTrapped in the pores of that sandstone are molecules that are even older still: the remains of countless prehistoric lifeforms, transformed by time and heat into oil and natural gas. That process happened even deeper in the earth. But oil and natural gas don't like to stay put; in an underground formation, both those substances want to go up. And these particular reservoirs of oil and gas worked their way upward through layers of rock until they became enmeshed in the sandstone.\n\nThink of water flowing until it reaches a dam: It pools where gravity makes it stop. The same thing can happen in oil and gas formations; the fuel moves up until it's stopped, and there, it starts to accumulate. That high concentration of fuel is valuable.\n\nThis journey through time and space explains why drillers have been interested in Ohio's sandstone formations since 1887.\n\nIt also explains why properly plugging an oil well is essential. Any remaining oil and gas, or other underground deposits of chemicals like hydrogen sulfide, could use the old well as a path to migrate up and into the atmosphere. They might also migrate sideways, into other layers of the earth  like those filled with water that people rely on. The result could be pollution both above and below ground, potentially harming local plants, animals and people, or escaping into the atmosphere and contributing to climate change.\n\nSo to plug a well, you can't just put a little cap on the top. You have to fill it with cement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd to fill that well all the way, you have to start from the bottom.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"You need to be able to get your tools, your cement tools, all the way to the bottom of the well,\" said Amanda Veazey, a vice president with CSR Services, the company that filled the well in Burns' yard.\n\nBefore they could start the cementing process, her team had to drill out the previous plug. It was a weekslong process, the noisy drill pushing further into the earth one 30-foot section at a time. The old cement got broken up and flushed out of the wellbore  the hole into the earth  with water, which was recycled through again and again.\n\nVeazey dipped a sieve into the flowing water to capture some of the chunks of cement. \"They're tiny,\" she said. \"A little bit larger than sugar crystals.\"\n\nBit by bit, all that old material had to come out before the cement trucks could arrive and start the process of plugging the well  again.\n\nAnd that was only the start of a very long process. While some wells can be plugged in a matter of days, the well in Burns' yard was not one of them. It took several tries to plug the well fully, and then multiple attempts to restore the yard's landscaping after the soil turned out to be more contaminated than anyone initially thought. \"They were here from October to April,\" Burns said ruefully last week. \"I hope they're finally done.\"\n\ntoggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n\nA problem for everyone, with no one on the hook\n\nThe well in Burns' yard was an \"orphan well,\" meaning a well for which no oil or gas company is legally responsible.\n\nIt wasn't Burns' job to fix it, either. But it was her yard. So she looked for help, and found Ohio's Orphan Well Program, which has been around for decades. After a few years, they were able to send the rig out.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It took me quite a while,\" she said. \"You have to get on the list.\" That's because the need for those plugging services far outstrips the state's abilities.\n\nThe exact number of orphan wells in the U.S. is not known, because many are not documented. But there are millions of old wells in the U.S.; one estimate, which is known to be an undercount, is that hundreds of thousands of those are orphan wells. Multiple experts have told NPR it's possible the national figure is more than a million. \"There are surely tens of thousands of unplugged wells in Ohio,\" says Mary Mertz, the director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, the state of Ohio plugged 353 orphan wells, she says.\n\n\"I know that doesn't sound like a lot,\" Mertz says, almost apologetically. But, she notes, it's a big increase from the handful of wells the program used to plug. (In fiscal year 2017, the state plugged 15 wells.)\n\nPlugging wells is not supposed to be the state's responsibility. In every state, the company that drills a well is required to seal it up safely at the end of its useful life. But there are several ways the public might wind up saddled with a problem well. The company that drilled the well may have plugged it, satisfying the legal requirements. But if the well starts to leak again decades later, the company isn't responsible for plugging it again. (That's what happened to the well in Burns' yard.)\n\nThere are also a number of wells from the early, less-regulated days of the oil industry, before plugging was required by law.\n\nAnd then there are newer orphan wells. They're most commonly created when a company that is legally on the hook for plugging a well goes bankrupt.\n\nTo address this risk, companies are required to put up money or get an insurance policy to cover the costs of well plugging in case they go under. The problem is the money involved  often in the form of a surety bond  is woefully inadequate.\n\nLast year, ProPublica examined the bond requirements in major oil-producing states, and compared it to the cost of actually plugging wells in each one. Overall, companies in oil-producing states are required to secure enough money to cover less than 2% of the potential costs incurred.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSome states are better off than others. Wyoming has set aside enough for 42% percent of the possible bill. But in Texas, the heart of the U.S. oil industry, it's only 1.5%.\n\nLoading...\n\nTo the extent that oil companies remain profitable and plug their wells, this isn't a problem. But when they go bankrupt and leave wells behind, someone else has to foot the bill.\n\nThere are efforts to use donations and voluntary carbon markets to pay for well-plugging. But overwhelmingly, plugging orphan wells is an obligation that has fallen on the government  or not been met at all.\n\ntoggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n\nA high cost and an uncertain future\n\nIn recent years, the government has started paying more attention to actually covering that bill. In addition to state-run programs like Ohio's, the federal government has now designated $4.7 billion dollars for plugging orphan wells. The program was launched under the Biden administration, and its future under the Trump administration is uncertain; the Department of the Interior told NPR in an emailed statement that some grants under the program will reopen for states to apply after a \"policy review,\" while other elements of the program are currently active.\n\nUnlike some of the Biden administration's environmental priorities, orphan well plugging generally has bipartisan support. Orphan wells are hazards to the public and perennial frustrations to landowners, and plugging them creates jobs in oil country.\n\nBut not all well-plugging programs are created equal. Ted Boettner is a senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley institute, a regional think tank. He has long studied orphan wells and says Ohio is doing a lot right. For instance, the state's program is funded by a fee on oil production instead of by taxpayers, which means the industry is, in a roundabout way, paying to clean up its own footprint.\n\n\"I do think Ohio offers a good example of what they're doing, in a very small way,\" he says. \"That needs to be, you know, much larger in size.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe challenge for every effort to scale up well-plugging: It's expensive. In 2019, the federal government described $20,000 per well as the \"low cost\" scenario, and $145,000 as the \"high cost\" side of the spectrum. There's been significant inflation since then.\n\nWith potentially more than a million orphan wells  and bankruptcies and inadequate bonds leaving even more wells orphaned in the future  it's clear that the $4.7 billion in federal dollars is only a first step.\n\nThe well in Maria Burns' yard was particularly challenging, in part because the old plug also had to be removed. The well was bundled together with another for contracting purposes, and the cost to plug the two was more than $400,000.\n\nIt's impossible to predict how many previously plugged wells will require this kind of remediation. And it raises an uncomfortable point: Even if well-plugging teams tackle every single well, the work might not be over, because they can leak and need to be re-plugged.\n\ntoggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n\n\"There's no guarantee of what happens 100 years down the line,\" said Veazey, the executive with CSR Services. But, she noted, the industry has learned a lot over the decades.\n\nIn an earlier era, wells might be plugged with wood or other materials that would never be allowed today. And the cement formulas used now have been refined over time to be more durable.\n\nHow durable? We'll find out."

        "content": "Its that time of year again, when we can all grouse about the inanity of the Oscars: how the Academy ignores blockbusters or ignores indie films or ignores people of color. Only this time, there seems less to grouse about than usual. There are snubs here and there of course (cough, Amy Adams), and actors who through error or pretense find themselves in the wrong categories. But overall the Academy did a pretty credible job this timecredible enough that for this year Im abandoning my customary categories of who was nominated but shouldnt have been and who wasnt nominated but should have been.\n\nBut who is going to win? Before attempting to answer that question, I should disclose that Ive gone 25 for 30 on my picks over the last three years (you can find them here, here, and here), but I missed on Best Picture last year. (I thought The Revenant would beat Spotlight, and I was delighted to be wrong.) It is also perhaps worth noting that I was so spectacularly certain that Avatar would beat The Hurt Locker back in 2010 that I wrote an entire article on the subject. (In that case, I was even happier to be wrong.) Also, as before, Im only going through ten of the top categories, so if you need help with your picks for sound editing or live-action short, youll have to seek assistance elsewhere.\n\nSo keep all that in mind. As always, I obviously cannot condone any form of gambling, and will in no way consider it my fault if anyone happens to lose money based on my advice. Anyone who makes a little scratch, by contrast, and might be inclined to share it with their Oscar Whisperer, will find me easy enough to track down. Those curious about my own end-of-the-year awards, some of which are notably eccentric, can find them here.\n\nA still from La La Land (Lionsgate / Summit)\n\nBest Picture\n\nNominees: Arrival, Fences, Hacksaw Ridge, Hell or High Water, Hidden Figures, La La Land, Lion, Manchester by the Sea, Moonlight\n\nThis has long been, and remains, La La Lands race to lose. Its become fashionable to lament that this is a bad thing and it would be better if Moonlight were to win instead. There are perhaps good arguments to be made on this score, but most of the arguments being made arent very good.\n\nIt is without question a promising sign that Moonlight, a movie about the romance between two black men coming of age in inner-city Miami, directed by a black man, is not only a Best Picture nominee but a genuine contender to win. This is especially true given the Academys much-noted shortcomings over the last couple of years.\n\nBut the widespread critique that La La Land is only the frontrunner because it is about Hollywoods love for itself dramatically shortchanges Damien Chazelles film, which is a tremendously ambitious undertaking on its own terms, novel and nostalgic in equal measure. This is not The Artist. Should La La Land come away with the statue, as I strongly suspect it will, it will mean nothing other than that it was a terrific film.\n\nIf youre looking for the upset, definitely go with Moonlight. If youre looking for a really big upset, try Manchester by the Sea or Hidden Figures. If you want an upset even bigger than that, buy a lottery ticket.\n\nWhat will win: La La Land\n\nWhat ought to win: Arrival\n\nDamien Chazelle on the set of La La Land (Dale Robinette / Lionsgate / Summit)\n\nBest Director\n\nNominees: Damien Chazelle (La La Land), Mel Gibson (Hacksaw Ridge), Barry Jenkins (Moonlight), Kenneth Lonergan (Manchester by the Sea), Denis Villeneuve (Arrival)\n\nThe big surprise here, of course, is that Mel Gibson was nominated, despite the facts that a) Hacksaw Ridge was good but not great; and b) not so long ago, Gibson had a very-well-earned reputation as a depraved maniac. But Hollywood can be forgiving, especially if you have the right friends.\n\nIn any case, Mel will not be repeating his Braveheart feat by taking home the actual statue. Here, again, the safe money is on Chazelle who, at 32, is already filling up his trophy case. For those who want to split their picture/director votes, Jenkins and Lonergan both have a shot here. Just not a very good one.\n\nWhich seems like as good a time as anyand no, it wont be the lastto express my unhappiness that Arrival, the best film of the year, is not really in the running for any of the major awards. My best explanation for this is that the film ultimately found itself betwixt and between: too big to be the kind of arty film that critics love to champion, but not big enough (its domestic box office was almost exactly $100 million) to force its way into the conversation,  la Avatar, in a the people have spoken fashion. Regardless, its terrific. Go see it if you havent already.\n\nWho will win: Damien Chazelle\n\nWho ought to win: Denis Villeneuve\n\nEmma Stone in La La Land (Lionsgate / Summit)\n\nBest Actress\n\nNominees: Isabelle Huppert (Elle), Ruth Negga (Loving), Natalie Portman (Jackie), Emma Stone (La La Land), Meryl Streep (Florence Foster Jenkins)\n\nThis is an unusually strong category this year, and would be stronger still if Academy voters hadnt briefly lost their minds and forgotten to nominate Amy Adams, who gave one of the years truly indelible performances in Arrival. Shame on you, Academy voters.\n\nEmma Stone is the favorite here, and shes a perfectly solid pickeven if Id prefer Negga or Huppert. The strongest challenger is probably Portman, which would be extremely dispiriting. Jackie was not a good movie, nor was hers a particularly good performance. When it comes to portrayals of well-known figures from the 20th century, there are two ways an actor can go: pure mimesis (the accent, the mannerisms, maybe a little prosthetic enhancement) or actually digging beneath the surface to find the real person underneath the fame. The examples I typically think of are Cate Blanchetts grating, empty portrait of Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator (for the former category) and Christopher Plummers deft and nuanced work as Mike Wallace in The Insider (for the latter).\n\nPortmans portrait of Jackie Kennedy falls firmly into the former set. Still, if you want to bet against Stone, this is probably the way to go. Theres a reason Blanchett won for The Aviator and Plummer wasnt even nominated for The Insider.\n\nWho will win: Emma Stone\n\nWho ought to win: Amy Adams (had she been nominated); of the nominees, Ruth Negga or Isabelle Huppert\n\nCasey Affleck in Manchester by the Sea (Amazon Studios)\n\nBest Actor\n\nNominees: Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea), Andrew Garfield (Hacksaw Ridge), Ryan Gosling (La La Land), Viggo Mortensen (Captain Fantastic), Denzel Washington (Fences)\n\nWhat was that I was saying about how Hollywood can be forgiving if you have the right friends? Well this is particularly true if those friends are Matt Damon and your big brother Ben Affleck. One can debate the ways in which the cases of Nate Parker and Casey Affleck are similar and are different, but the formers early Oscar hopes vanished entirely and the latters appear to be chugging along unimpeded.\n\nIt helps Affleck considerably that his performance was genuinely remarkable and his competition is relatively weak, especially given the customary strength of the category. Denzel Washington has the best chance of pulling off an upset hereand its a pretty decent one. Hes hampered a bit by the fact that Fences (which Washington directed himself) has very much a filmed play quality to it, as does his notably theatrical performance. Gosling may have a (very) outside shot here, too. But if youre looking for an upset in the major categoriesor you just dont feel good about picking AffleckWashington is probably the way to go.\n\nWho will win: Casey Affleck\n\nWho ought to win: Casey Affleck\n\nViola Davis in Fences (Paramount)\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nNominees: Viola Davis (Fences), Naomie Harris (Moonlight), Nicole Kidman (Lion), Octavia Spencer (Hidden Figures), Michelle Williams (Manchester by the Sea)\n\nEvery year, there is at least one performer who competes a weight class lower than he or she should in order to get a win. Last year, Rooney Mara and Alicia Vikander both submitted what were really lead performances, but were both nominated for supporting actressa category that Vikander wound up winning.\n\nViola Davis is no dummy. Shes been nominated for Oscars twice before without winning (for Doubt and The Help), and she wants to take home that statue. Which, as it happens, she is overwhelmingly likely to do. I said it last year and Ill say it again. The Academy has to take firmer control of its own nominating process if we dont want to see category fraud like this every season. Davis is a great actress, and was the best thing in Fences. But she should be competingand perhaps winningagainst Stone, Portman, Negga, and Huppert.\n\nIf you must bet against Davis, Naomie Harris and Michelle Williams have about equal chances of pulling off an upsetwhich is to say, very little chance at all.\n\nWho will win: Viola Davis\n\nWho ought to win: Viola Davis\n\nMahershala Ali (left) in Moonlight (A24)\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nNominees: Mahershala Ali (Moonlight), Jeff Bridges (Hell or High Water), Lucas Hedges (Manchester by the Sea), Dev Patel (Lion), Michael Shannon (Nocturnal Animals)\n\nWell, at least the Academy realized that if it was going to nominate a performance in Nocturnal Animals it should be Michael Shannons slightly creepy lawman and not Aaron Taylor-Johnsons totally forgettable outlaw. The fact that the latter was nominatedand won!at the Golden Globes is yet further evidence (as if any were needed in this age) that voters are capable of doing strange and awful things.\n\nLets assume that the universe has righted itself sufficiently to correct at least this injustice, by giving Mahershala Ali the award he so very clearly deserves. His work in Moonlight was nothing short of stunning.\n\nJeff Bridges is no doubt just happy to be nominated for his outstanding work in Hell or High Water. But if youre looking for someone to upset Ali, Dev Patel may have a very small shot. Or who knows? Maybe Aaron Taylor-Johnson can win again, this time by write-in vote. My capacity for astonishment has been pretty much exhausted of late.\n\nWho will win: Mahershala Ali\n\nWho ought to win: Mahershala Ali\n\nA still from Manchester by the Sea (Amazon Studios)\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nNominees: Hell or High Water, La La Land, The Lobster, Manchester by the Sea, 20th Century Women\n\nIts awfully nice to see The Lobster, Yorgos Lanthimoss dystopian tour de force, get some attention here, though if it somehow manages an out-of-nowhere victory, Ill eat  a lobster? That actually doesnt sound so bad.\n\nIts also nice to see what could be a genuinely close race here, between La La Land and Manchester by the Sea. There are a number of ways of looking at this one. Will voters go with director Lonergans screenplay as an alternative to voting for Affleck as best actor? Or will any Affleck-related drag be able to sink the movie in a close race (like this one) but not in a possible blowout in the acting category? Will La La Land benefit, sweep-like, from its many awards? Or could Chazelle fatigue set in?\n\nThis is the category in which I am least confident of all, but Im going with Manchester by the Sea by a nose.\n\nWhat will win: Manchester by the Sea\n\nWhat ought to win: La La Land\n\nA still from Moonlight (A24)\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nNominees: Arrival, Fences, Hidden Figures, Lion, Moonlight\n\nApart from Supporting Actor, this is the category in which Moonlightwhich is adapted from Tarell Alvin McCraneys play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blueis most likely to come away a winner. Arrival once looked like it had a solid shot here, like its fellow thinking persons sci-fi movieand best film of the yearHer three years ago. But my best efforts notwithstanding, it seems to have lost any momentum it ever had.\n\nIf theres an upset in the making, its likely to be either Hidden Figures or Lion. But neither seems particularly likely.\n\nWhat will win: Moonlight\n\nWhat ought to win: Arrival\n\nA still from La La Land (Lionsgate / Summit)\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nNominees: Greig Fraser (Lion), James Laxton (Moonlight), Rodrigo Prieto (Silence), Linus Sandgren (La La Land), Bradford Young (Arrival)\n\nSo what do we know about the cinematography award? We know that, because he is not nominated, Emmanuel Lubezki is probably not going to win for a fourth year in a row (following Gravity, Birdman, and The Revenant). And, nothing against Lubezki, but thats probably a good thing. We also know that Roger Deakins, who has been nominated an incredible 13 times without ever winning, isnt going to winbecause hes not nominated either. Nor is (three-time winner, nine-time nominee) Robert Richardson. Keeping track of the award this year is a little like watching the NBA Finals with LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, Draymond Green, and Kevin Love all sitting out hurt.\n\nBradford Young is the first African-American cinematographer ever nominated for the award, which is shocking, and hed be my pick in a heartbeat for his magnificent work on (you guessed it) Arrival. (He also shot my two favorite films of 2014, Selma and A Most Violent Year.) But here, again, Arrival doesnt seem likely to get much love.The safest bet, as so often this year, is probably on La La Land and its cinematographer Linus Sandgren. If you want to look elsewhere, Lion probably has the best shot at an upset. Or partisans of Moonlight and Arrival can just cross their fingers and take their chances.\n\nWho will win: Linus Sandgren\n\nWho ought to win: Bradford Young\n\nA still from Zootopia (Disney)\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nNominees: Kubo and the Two Strings, Moana, My Life as a Zucchini, The Red Turtle, Zootopia\n\nOne of the most remarkable inversions in recent cinema is the way Pixar and Disney Animationwhich are both owned by the same company and run by the same executiveshave essentially switched places. (Ill be writing more about this soon.) Disney scored two nominations in the Animated Feature category this year, with Zootopia and Moana. Pixar, meanwhile, couldnt manage a nod for Finding Dory, despite the fact that it was the second-highest grossing movie of the year behind Rogue One. Go figure.\n\nIt was actually a banner year for animated movies, especially if you managed to avoid the truly awful Sing. The Red Turtle is a gorgeous, almost-silent fable. Moana is a classic Disney musical showstopper. And Kubo and the Two Strings may be the best stop-motion marvel yet produced by the always excellent Laika (Coraline, ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls.)\n\nBut barring a borderline-shocking upset by Kubo, the Oscar will be going to Zootopia. Which is exactly as it should be.\n\nWhat will win: Zootopia\n\nWhat should win: Zootopia"

        "content": "A flower was placed in front of the California National Guard during protests on Alameda Street on June 12, 2025 in Los Angeles.\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Tuesday questioning both President Trumps decision to deploy federal troops to Los Angeles and the courts right to review it, teeing up what is likely to be a fierce new challenge to presidential power in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nA panel of three judges  two appointed by President Trump, one by President Biden  pressed hard on the administrations central assertion that the president had nearly unlimited discretion to deploy the military on American streets.\n\nBut they also appeared to cast doubt on last weeks ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that control of the National Guard must immediately return to California authorities. A pause on that decision remains in effect while the judges deliberate, with a decision expected as soon as this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crucial question ... is whether the judges seem inclined to accept Trumps argument that he alone gets to decide if the statutory requirements for nationalizing the California national guard are met, said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law.\n\nThe questions at the heart of the case test the limits of presidential authority, which the U.S. Supreme Court has vastly expanded in recent years.\n\nWhen one of the Trump appointees, Judge Mark J. Bennett of Honolulu, asked if a president could call up the National Guard in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in response to unrest in California and be confident that decision was entirely unreviewable by the courts, Assistant Atty. Gen. Brett Shumate replied unequivocally: Yes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat couldnt be any more clear, Shumate said. The president gets to decide how many forces are necessary to quell rebellion and execute federal laws.\n\nIts not for the court to abuse its authority just because there may be hypothetical cases in the future where the president might have abused his authority, he added.\n\nCalifornia Deputy Solicitor General Samuel Harbourt said that interpretation was dangerously broad and risked harm to American democratic norms if upheld.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe dont have a problem with according the president some level of appropriate deference, Harbourt said. The problem ... is that theres really nothing to defer to here.\n\nThe Trump administration said it deployed troops to L.A. to ensure immigration enforcement agents could make arrests and conduct deportations, arguing demonstrations downtown against that activity amounted to rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\n\nState and local officials said the move was unjustified and nakedly political  an assessment shared by Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer, whose ruling last week would have handed control of most troops back to California leaders.\n\nBreyer heard the challenge in Californias Northern District, but saw his decision appealed and put on hold within hours by the 9th Circuit.\n\nThe appellate courts stay left the Trump administration in command of thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines in L.A. through the weekend, when demonstrators flooded streets as part of the nationwide No Kings protests.\n\nThe events were largely peaceful, with just more than three dozen demonstrators arrested in L.A. Saturday and none on Sunday  compared to more than 500 taken into custody during the unrest of the previous week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHundreds of Marines still stationed in L.A.will provide logistical support processing ICE detainees, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Tuesday. Under last weeks executive order, National Guard troops will remain deployed for 60 days.\n\nArguing before the appellate panel Tuesday, Shumate said the military presence was necessary to defend against ongoing mob violence in L.A. streets.\n\nFederal personnel in Los Angeles continue to face sustained mob violence in Los Angeles, the administrations lawyer said. Unfortunately, local authorities are either unable or unwilling to protect federal personnel and property.\n\nHarbourt struck back at those claims.\n\n[Violence] is of profound concern to the leaders of the state, the California deputy solicitor general said. But the state is dealing with it.\n\nHowever, the three judges seemed less interested in the facts on the ground in Los Angeles than in the legal question of who gets to decide how to respond.\n\nIn the normal course, the level of resistance encountered by federal law enforcement officers is not zero, right? Judge Eric D. Miller of Seattle asked. So does that mean ... you could invoke this whenever?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the appellate court weighed those arguments, California officials sought to bolster the states case in district court in filings Monday and early Tuesday.\n\nThe actions of the President and the Secretary of Defense amount to an unprecedented and dangerous assertion of executive power, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta wrote in a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nMarines push back anti-ICE protesters in front of the Federal Building during No Kings Day in Downtown on Saturday. (Carlin Stiehl/Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe President asserts that [the law] authorizes him to federalize State National Guard units and deploy armed soldiers into the streets of American cities and towns whenever he perceives opposition or disobedience of a legal command, the motion continued. He then asserts that no court can review that decision, assigning himself virtually unchecked power.\n\nThe president boasted he would liberate Los Angeles, during a speech to troops at Fort Bragg last week.\n\nIn court, Bonta called the deployment a military occupation of the nations second-largest city.\n\nLos Angeles officials also weighed in, saying in an amicus brief filed Monday by the City Attorneys office that the military deployment complicates efforts to keep Angelenos safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe domestic use of the military is corrosive, the brief said. Every day that this deployment continues sows fear among City residents, erodes their trust in the City, and escalates the conflicts they have with local law enforcement.\n\nThe appellate court largely sidestepped that question, though Bennett and Judge Jennifer Sung in Portland appeared moved by Harbourts argument that keeping guard troops in L.A. kept them from other critical duties, including fighting wildfires.\n\nThe judges were sensitive to that, and so if theyre ultimately going to land on a no for the troops, theyll do it sooner rather than later, said professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond. If theyre persuaded I think theyll move fast.\n\nWith the issue all but certain to face further litigation and a fast-track to the Supreme Court, observers said the 9th Circuits decision will influence how the next set of judges interpret the case  a process that could drag on for months.\n\nBoth sides seem in a hurry to have a decision, but all [the Supreme Court] can do this late in the term is hear an emergency appeal, Tobias said. Any full-dress ruling would likely not come until the next term."

        "content": "Majority Leader John Thune walks toward the Senate floor on June 30, 2025, as lawmakers in the chamber debate President Trumps massive tax and spending bill.\n\nPresident Trumps megabill encompassing his domestic agenda on Monday inched closer to becoming law as Republican senators sifted through familiar procedural hurdles toward a final vote on legislation that would dramatically transform the tax code and Medicaid.\n\nThroughout a day of marathon voting, senators offered amendments to the bill that could ultimately decide whether it secures passage through Congress. If the Senate approves the legislation  as it is expected to do by a slim, simple majority and with bipartisan opposition  then the House will have to vote for a second time on the final text before it goes to the presidents desk for his signature.\n\nAnticipating Senate passage, the House Rules Committee has already scheduled a hearing on reconciling the two bills for Tuesday. The White House previously set July 4 as a goal to get the package, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by both chambers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut several Republicans are still criticizing the bill, including Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who announced he will not seek reelection in 2026 over the weekend before ripping into the legislation as a betrayal to voters.\n\nAlthough the legislation has hundreds of provisions, its most sweeping would make tax breaks passed in 2017 during Trumps first term permanent  an expensive proposition  before they are set to expire at the end of this year, while attempting to offset some of those costs with historic cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, social welfare programs that for decades had been seen as a political third rail.\n\nPolling shows that Americans broadly support extending the 2017 tax cuts. Other expensive programs in the bill  including additional funding for border security and defense  also enjoy public support. But polls indicate that the public disapproves of the bill overall by a double-digit margin due to its cuts to core government programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the fundings not there anymore? Tillis said in a speech from the Senate floor. The people in the White House advising the president are not telling him that the effect of this bill is to break a promise.\n\nBoth Paul and Tillis voted against advancing the bill to a floor vote and have indicated they will vote no on its final passage.\n\nRepublicans are about to make a mistake on healthcare, and betraying a promise, Tillis continued. It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made in the Oval Office, or in the Cabinet room, when I was there with Finance [Committee members] where he said, We can go after waste, fraud and abuse on any programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillis and a handful of his GOP colleagues, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, have expressed concern with elements of the bill that restrict state taxes on healthcare providers, known as the provider tax, an essential tool for many states in their efforts to supplement Medicaid funding.\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian has already determined that the provision, among others, fails to follow the rules of the chamber and must be removed or modified. Another passage crucial to the bill, which introduces a structure for work requirements for Medicaid, was halted by the parliamentarian.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks to reporters outside the chamber on June 30, 2025. (Manuel Balce Ceneta / Associated Press)\n\nRepublicans efforts to prohibit the use of Medicaid funds on gender transition care, to cancel regulations that require a minimum staffing ratio at nursing homes and to limit Medicaid access to immigrants were also cut by the parliamentarian, who continued to review amendments to the bill as they were introduced Monday.\n\nThe parliamentarians moves eat into the stated cost savings of a bill that is already slated to add trillions of dollars to the debt over the next decade  a problem for fiscal hawks in both chambers whose votes will be crucial for passage.\n\nThey also gutted key provisions that were top priorities for Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the focus of an intense lobbying campaign by Senate Republican leadership after expressing skepticism over several provisions of the legislation. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is up for reelection next cycle, has also expressed concern over its cuts to Medicaid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an ongoing process  the president continues to be very much engaged with the leadership in both the Senate and the House, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters in a briefing Monday. He understands that legislators want to protect jobs in the communities and their districts.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate have been united in their opposition to the bill, with Mark Kelly, of Arizona, warning Republicans of electoral repercussions.\n\nIf they lose their health insurance, he told MSNBC in an interview, sure, theyre going to remember.\n\nBut the potential political windfall for Democrats isnt stopping the party from attempting to improve the legislation, he said, noting a number of amendments proposed by Democratic senators Monday that would roll back cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nIf the bill does ultimately clear the Senate, Republicans will have only a handful of votes in the House to spare in a final vote. And several are already suggesting they will vote against it, including Rep. David Valadao of California, whose constituents rely heavily on Medicaid.\n\nIm not a yes necessarily, said Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who has announced his retirement. Bacon added that he believes the Senate version has gone too far in gutting healthcare programs. I think well have a hard time passing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn intraparty fight has also broken out among Republicans over the fate of green energy tax credits, which several GOP senators  including Murkowski, as well as Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa  sought to preserve for several more years. A group of House Republicans had successfully lobbied in their version of the bill to speed up the termination of those credits.\n\nElon Musk, a co-founder of Tesla, and Trumps close advisor and benefactor before the two men fell out a month ago, renewed his attacks on the legislation Monday, calling it utterly insane and destructive for its price tag.\n\nIt is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country  the PORKY PIG PARTY!! Musk wrote.\n\nTime for a new political party, he added, that actually cares about the people."

        "content": "Republican lawmakers are on the cusp of handing President Donald Trump a major legislative victory by passing his entire congressional agenda in one fell swoop. But many Americans will face more costs than tangible new benefits from the sprawling tax and immigration enforcement bill that adds trillions to the national debt.\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday passed its version of the Big, Beautiful Bill by the barest of majorities  51 to 50  after more than 26 hours of debate and amendments. House Republicans are rushing to try to pass the bill into law this week before a July 4th deadline set by the president, though a handful of House GOP critics make that prospect less than certain.\n\nThe bills most expensive component is an extension of the individual tax cuts that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans passed into law during his first term and which are set to soon expire.\n\nWhy We Wrote This As the Senate passed its version of President Trumps Big Beautiful Bill, the main priority was to preserve a low-tax status quo. The other major outcome: tighter eligibility for Medicaid and nutrition assistance.\n\nWhen Republicans passed their tax cut package in 2017, they made the corporate tax cuts permanent while sunsetting individual tax cuts to comply with Senate rules that bar reconciliation bills from increasing the federal deficit after 10 years. Their assumption at the time  which is proving correct  was that future members of Congress, facing the imminent prospect of a tax hike on their voters, would vote to extend the cuts.\n\nBut as Republicans now move to make those lower rates permanent, it wont actually feel any different to taxpayers. And many of the bills spending cuts  such as to Medicaid and food stamps  will impact their voters directly. Even with the cuts to government programs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the just-passed Senate bill will add a net $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.\n\nWhat the bill does add in new, tangible benefits for Americans is limited. It temporarily suspends taxes on tips and overtime pay and lowers taxes on Social Security benefits, but those changes only last through 2028. People facing higher state taxes will be able to deduct more from their federal returns, but only for five years. The bill increases the child tax credit. But it strips that credit from noncitizens who pay taxes, meaning families with American citizen children and two noncitizen immigrant parents would see a tax increase.\n\nAccording to the Tax Policy Center, the bill is extending a tax cut of less than 2 percentage points for an average middle-income taxpayer  roughly $1,750.\n\nThe bill also includes roughly $150 billion for border security and expanding interior enforcement, a top priority for President Trump (and a reason he won in 2024, though poll numbers on immigration have since slid).\n\nPressure to extend tax cuts\n\nRepublicans acknowledge the bill isnt offering big new benefits, but point to the downside of not extending the tax cuts.\n\nThe most important part of this is the extension of the tax cuts, says South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, adding that the bill was primarily aimed at fixing things so that we dont have major shock.\n\nIf Congress fails to act, a typical family will face a $1,700 tax hike, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the Senate floor last week. Republicans are determined to make sure that that doesnt happen.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that extending the tax cuts alone will cost the government $2.2 trillion over the next decade. The GOP bill also extends a reduction in the estate tax, which was part of the 2017 bill. The CBO estimates that will cost another $200 billion in revenue over the next decade.\n\nWhen asked to compare the tangible new outcomes of this bill to other recent expensive megabills like the original 2017 GOP tax cut, President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, or President Joe Bidens green energy credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson scoffed.\n\nEric Gay/Ap A man is detained by federal agents following an appearance at immigration court, June 23, 2025, in San Antonio, Texas. The Senate bill includes roughly $150 billion for border security and expanding interior enforcement.\n\nEverybody loves to go to Disney World. Its exciting to spend money. Its not very exciting to go, We cant afford it, he says. Nobody in my party wants to increase taxes. This isnt a tax cut. This is just preventing a massive tax increase.\n\nThe Senate bill cuts more than $1 trillion in combined federal spending from Medicaid and SNAP programs, better known as food stamps. It also rolls back a half-trillion dollars of clean energy tax credits passed under President Biden, cuts off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, and establishes a new tax on investment income on endowments for colleges and universities with more than 3,000 students that goes as high as 8%.\n\nCentral to the Medicaid and SNAP cuts are new work requirements for recipients who are able-bodied adults without young children  changes that analysts say will not only eliminate coverage for many of those people but also impact people who would qualify but will fail to apply. The Senate went further than the House in cutting Medicaid, by limiting how much the federal government will reimburse states for Medicaid coverage  likely forcing states to limit benefits and threatening rural hospitals. (The bill includes $50 billion to offset some of this disruption.)\n\nThe bill will likely be the largest cut in Medicaid coverage since the program was created in the 1960s. The CBO estimates that 11.8 million more Americans will lack health insurance by 2034 if the Senate bill becomes law  more than the 10.9 million under the House version of the bill. The bill also lets health insurance subsidies granted during the COVID-19 pandemic expire, which the CBO estimates will cause another 4.2 million people to lose coverage.\n\nPresident Trump himself has pledged not to cut Medicaid beyond eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse  a pledge that North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis noted when he slammed the bill over the weekend.\n\nIt is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the promise that Donald J. Trump made, Senator Tillis said on the Senate floor. What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there anymore?\n\nMr. Tillis, who voted against the bill, announced that he would not run for reelection next year, shortly after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenger against him.\n\nThe bills critics also include the senator who put it over the top.\n\nDo I like this bill? No, Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who backed the legislation after getting a number of state-specific carveouts for her own constituents, told NBC News shortly after the vote. I tried to take care of Alaskas interests. But I know, I know, that in many parts of the country there are Americans that are not going to be advantaged by this bill. I dont like that.\n\nSenator Murkowski later issued a statement saying that she hoped the House would further amend the bill.\n\nThe Medicaid and SNAP cuts were put in place to satisfy conservatives who say theyre worried about the deficit. But the CBO estimates the bill has only $1 trillion in cuts to more than $4 trillion in tax cuts and new spending. Senate Republicans relied on a never-before-used budget gimmick to ignore that number and work around normal rules that apply to reconciliation bills, using the current law as a baseline for analyzing the tax cuts impact to claim that since they were just extending it that it wouldnt add anything to the deficit.\n\nVice President JD Vance, who cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the Senate bill on Tuesday, sought to refocus the conversation away from the Medicaid cuts and onto the billions in new funding for border security and deportation efforts.\n\n[T]he CBO score, the proper baseline, the minutiae of the Medicaid policy  is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions, he posted on X. The thing that will bankrupt this country more than any other policy is flooding the country with illegal immigration.\n\nBut for many Republicans, the Medicaid changes are a feature, not a bug. Senator Johnson, who wanted even deeper Medicaid and other spending cuts in the bill, says Republicans had to clean up the mess of previous administrations deficit spending.\n\nDemocrats already writing their campaign ads\n\nDemocrats have made clear theyll put the Medicaid cuts at the center of their 2026 midterm strategy.\n\nThe bill isnt popular, according to multiple recent public polls. A Fox News survey found it underwater with registered voters by 59%-38%; the Pew Research Center found Americans opposed it 49%-29%; and a Washington Post-Ipsos survey found Americans opposing it 42%-23%.\n\nStill, Democrats will have some work to do to make the bill a campaign issue.\n\nNearly half of Americans hadnt heard anything about the bill, according to polling released Monday from the Democratic group Priorities USA, and just 8% of Americans said theyd heard that the bill would cut Medicaid, a sign that the details of the massive piece of legislation arent yet breaking through with voters. Awareness of the GOP bill is limited, diffuse and general in nature, at best, the group wrote in a memo accompanying the poll.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are pushing to begin votes on the Senate bill as soon as Wednesday, with the goal of sending it to President Trump before the weekend.\n\nThe legislation still faces some hurdles in the House, with both centrists and hard-line conservatives griping about some of its provisions.\n\nRepublican Rep. David Valadao, a moderate whose rural California district has a high proportion of Medicaid recipients, has said that he would vote against the bill because of the Senates additional cuts to Medicaid spending, specifically citing its changes to federal funds for rural hospitals. Rep. Don Bacon, a moderate Republican from Nebraska who is retiring, said on Monday that the Senate had made concerning changes to the House bill regarding Medicaid, though he declined to say how hell vote on the final product. A number of other swing-district Republicans have signaled their unhappiness with the bills Medicaid changes as well.\n\nOn the other side, hard-line conservatives including Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Chip Roy of Texas, and Andy Harris of Maryland have complained about the Senate bills costs, with Congressman Norman calling the Senate changes to the bill unconscionable and pledging to vote against it.\n\nHouse Republicans can only afford to lose three votes if they hope to pass this legislation. They passed their own version of the bill with no votes to spare in May. But many members have griped and threatened to oppose major votes in the past, only to buckle under pressure from President Trump in the end."

        "content": "A new study of defense department spending previewed exclusively to the Guardian shows that most of the Pentagons discretionary spending from 2020 to 2024 has gone to outside military contractors, providing a $2.4tn boon in public funds to private firms in what was described as a continuing and massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to fund war and weapons manufacturing.\n\nThe report from the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and Costs of War project at Brown University said that the Trump administrations new Pentagon budget will push annual US military spending past the $1tn mark.\n\nThat will deliver a projected windfall of more than half a trillion dollars that will be shared among top arms firms such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as well as a growing military tech sector with close allies in the administration such as JD Vance, the report said.\n\nThe report is compiled of statistics of Pentagon spending and contracts from 2020 to 2024, during which time the top five Pentagon contractors (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman) received $771bn in contract awards. Overall, private firms received approximately 54% of the departments discretionary spending of $4.4tn over that period.\n\nTaking into account supplemental funding for the Pentagon passed by Congress under Trumps One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the report said, the US military budget will have nearly doubled this century, increasing 99% since 2000.\n\nThe rapid growth in military spending that began under the Bush administrations post-9/11 and the global war on terror has now been continued on spending to counter China as the USs main rival in the 21st century, as well record foreign arms transfers to Israel and Ukraine.\n\nThe US withdrawal from Afghanistan in September 2021 did not result in a peace dividend, the authors of the report wrote. Instead, President Biden requested, and Congress authorized, even higher annual budgets for the Pentagon, and President Trump is continuing that same trajectory of escalating military budgets.\n\nThat contradicts early indications from Trump in February that he could cut military spending in half, adding that he would tell China and Russia that theres no reason for us to be spending almost $1tn on the military  and Im going to say we can spend this on other things. Instead, the spending bill pushed by Trump through Congress included a $157bn spending boost for the Pentagon.\n\nThe growth in spending will increasingly benefit firms in the military tech sector who represent tech companies like SpaceX, Palantir and Anduril, the report said, that are deeply embedded in the Trump administration, which should give it an upper hand in the budget battles to come.\n\nHigh Pentagon budgets are often justified because the funds are for the troops, said William D Hartung, senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and an author of the report. But as this paper shows, the majority of the departments budget goes to corporations, money that has as much to do with special interest lobbying as it does with any rational defense planning. Much of this funding has been wasted on dysfunctional or overpriced weapons systems and extravagant compensation packages.\n\nThese figures represent a continuing and massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to fund war and weapons manufacturing, said Stephanie Savell, director of the Costs of War project.\n\nCalculated for inflation, the military spending dwarfs an approximate $356bn that Congress had appropriated for US diplomacy, development and humanitarian aid.\n\nThe Trump administration has continued to slash money spent on aid. Last month, the Guardian revealed that a White House review of grants to the state department recommended a near total cut on democracy promotion programs.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the Pentagon for comment."

        "content": "People pass by a CiBanco branch in Mexico City on Thursday. The U.S. Department of the Treasury accused the bank and two other Mexican financial institutions of laundering millions of dollars for cartels.\n\nPresident Trumps vow to wage war on drug cartels has resulted in bombshell accusations of money laundering against three Mexican financial institutions  allegations that produced a defiant pushback from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\nTheres no proof, just words, a clearly agitated Sheinbaum told reporters on Thursday. There has to be proof to know if there was money laundering or not. Therefore, we dont deny it or accept it.\n\nA day earlier, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued what it called historic sanctions against CiBanco, Intercam Banco and Vector Casa de Bolsa. The department accused the three of laundering millions of dollars in narco-cash to facilitate the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe orders affirm Treasurys commitment to using all tools at our disposal to counter the threat posed by criminal and terrorist organizations, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release.\n\nThe Treasury Department move would largely prohibit U.S. financial institutions from dealing with the three sanctioned entities, in effect shutting them out from access to the worlds largest market.\n\nThe Treasury accused the three firms of laundering funds for various Mexican drug cartels and facilitating payments for the procurement of precursor chemicals needed to produce fentanyl.\n\nU.S. authorities say Mexican cartels use chemicals imported from China to produce fentanyl in clandestine laboratories and then smuggle the potent opioid into the United States. Black-market fentanyl has led to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the United States, officials say.\n\nSheinbaum has been widely lauded for her non-confrontational, cool-headed approach with the Trump administration, despite many disagreements  including on Trumps imposition of 25% tariffs on some Mexican imports, a levy meant to prompt Mexico to crack down further on fentanyl smuggling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Sheinbaum signaled her clear displeasure with Treasurys punitive actions.\n\nWe arent anyones piata, Sheinbaum said, adding, We coordinate, collaborate  we have said this many times  but we will not subordinate ourselves.\n\nIn Mexico, some analysts have called the Treasury moves a broadside against Mexicos economic well-being. U.S. authorities have frequently sanctioned Mexican companies and individuals for alleged links to drug smuggling, but experts say the targeting of banks is much less frequent.\n\nThe accusation is the gravest news for the Mexican financial system in decades and represents a point of no return for these three firms, wrote columnist Carlos Mota of the El Heraldo de Mxico newspaper. The entire Mexican financial system entered into shock.\n\nBut the Treasury said that any burden and disruption should be relatively minimal, since none of the three firms is a dominant player in Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll institutions  two banks and a brokerage house, all medium-sized firms  denied any wrongdoing.\n\nVector Casa de Bolsa said it categorically rejected any imputation that compromises its institutional integrity. Vector manages about $11 billion in total assets, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe case against Vector has drawn special scrutiny in Mexico because of the firms ties to Alfonso Romo, a businessman who served for two years as chief of staff for former President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador, Sheinbaums predecessor, mentor and the founder of Mexicos dominant Morena political bloc.\n\nWorld & Nation Immigrant protests, unrest in L.A. reverberate in Mexico News coverage of the immigration raids and protests in Southern California has transfixed Mexico, where reports have heavily sided with the immigrants against U.S. efforts to detain and deport them.\n\nAfter leaving the chief of staff position, Romo remained a top economic advisor to Lpez Obrador.\n\nMexican media accounts have described Romo as the honorary president and co-founder of Vector. Romo has not commented publicly. According to Mexican media reports, Mexicos current finance minister, Edgar Amador, is a former analyst with Vector.\n\nAmong other allegations against Vector, the Treasury said that from 2013 to 2016 a suspected Sinaloa cartel money mule transferred more than $1.5 million to the brokerage firm. Vector was also accused of links to millions of dollars in Sinaloa cartel payouts to Genaro Garca Luna, Mexicos former top federal security official.\n\nGarca Luna was convicted in 2023 in U.S. district court of colluding with the Sinaloa mob and receiving millions of dollars in graft. He is serving a 38-year prison sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. order against the three Mexican financial institutions is to take effect in 21 days. It is a civil action and does not involve criminal charges.\n\nSpecial correspondent Cecilia Snchez Vidal contributed to this report."

Lauren Paterson with Northwest Public Broadcasting was in the courtroom.\n\nLAUREN PATERSON, BYLINE: In the early morning hours of November 13, three years ago, four University of Idaho students were stabbed to death by someone who broke into an off-campus house. The crime shocked the small, normally quiet college town of Moscow, Idaho, as police gathered evidence and hunted for a suspect. More than a month later, they arrested 28-year-old Bryan Kohberger in Pennsylvania at his parents' home. Kohberger maintained his innocence, claiming he was out for a drive at the time of the murders. Prosecutors said they found DNA evidence on a knife sheath tying him to the scene.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSTEVEN HIPPLER: We are here today to entertain a change of plea.\n\nPATERSON: Yesterday, the families of the victims, reporters and police packed a courtroom for a hearing that was scheduled just one day before. Judge Steven Hippler addressed Kohberger.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHIPPLER: Are you pleading guilty because you are guilty?\n\nBRYAN KOHBERGER: Yes.\n\nPATERSON: Kohberger admitted to killing all four students who were 20 and 21 years old. In order to avoid a potential death sentence, he accepted a plea of consecutive life terms for the murders of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, waiving his right to appeal. The reactions of the victims' families to the deal prosecutors offered were mixed.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSTEVE GONCALVES: He didn't give us the common courtesy to negotiate with us.\n\nPATERSON: Steve Goncalves, father of Kaylee Goncalves, was upset Prosecutor Bill Thompson did not involve his family in the decision.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGONCALVES: He only negotiated with the murderer of our children. That was the only person that he negotiated.\n\nPATERSON: But family members of students Mogen and Chapin said Tuesday that they support the plea deal. Bryan Kohberger, now 30, is being held in the Ada County, Idaho, jail. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 23.\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Lauren Paterson in Boise.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ELOIS JACQ'S \"IDYLLWILD\")\n\nCopyright  2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "content": "President Donald Trump made a visit Tuesday to mark the opening of a controversial immigrant detention site in Florida that officials have dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, underscoring the administrations commitment to expanding its mass deportation campaign through a variety of partnerships.\n\nThis facility is exactly what I want every single governor in this country to consider doing with us, said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in Florida with the president on Tuesday.\n\nThe Alligator Alcatraz site is one of an array of unorthodox ways in which the Trump administration and supportive states are looking to square a rise in the number of immigrants arrested with limited space to hold people while they await court proceedings or deportation. The effort raises questions about how many new detention facilities are being built across the United States and what the long-term effect of such projects will be.\n\nWhy We Wrote This President Donald Trump is touting Floridas unusual new immigration detention facility in the Everglades  part of a wider effort underway to create spaces to hold people caught up in the administrations deportation campaign.\n\nThe Trump administration has set an aggressive target of arresting 3,000 unauthorized immigrants a day, according to media reports, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a declared goal of 1 million deportations per year. As a result, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has needed to rapidly expand detention capabilities, including by increasing partnerships with state governments and private prison companies.\n\nWhat is Alligator Alcatraz?\n\nFlorida Attorney General James Uthmeier proposed the idea for the detention center in a June 19 video on X, nodding to the famous Alcatraz prison near San Francisco, now a museum. The Florida detention center is based at an old airport facility, and the site is bordered by the waters of the Everglades, which are home to alligators and pythons.\n\nMarco Bello/Reuters Betty Osceola of the Miccosukee Panther Clan uses a bullhorn as pro-immigrant advocates, environmental groups, members of the Miccosukee Native American community, and others protest the opening of Florida's \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center in Ochopee, Florida, June 28, 2025.\n\nMr. Uthmeier called the plan an efficient, low-cost opportunity to build a temporary detention facility, and said he received approval for the plan from the DHS. Florida is pursuing a hard-line immigration enforcement campaign in support of President Trumps agenda.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized the construction under emergency powers. The state quickly built up the site using heavy-duty tents and trailers. Secretary Noem said the site, which will be managed by the state of Florida, will have around 3,000 beds, with 2,000 at another location.\n\nIn February, Governor DeSantis directed state law enforcement to enter into new agreements with ICE allowing Florida officers to perform specific immigration functions, like detaining individuals until ICE can take custody.\n\nDHS says the site will cost Florida about $450 million for one year, and that the state can submit reimbursement requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nProtesters lined streets outside a virtually abandoned airstrip in Florida June 28 to oppose the official opening. Many cited environmental concerns and potentially poor conditions for the immigrants held there. The Miccosukee and Seminole tribes also consider the land sacred. Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat, called the facility a cruel spectacle intended to brutalize, starve, and harm immigrants. Environmentalists have sued to stop the plan.\n\nHow is ICE expanding detention centers to meet deportation goals?\n\nCongress has currently allocated funding for over 40,000 detention beds, according to the American Immigration Council. The tax and spending bill Republicans in Congress are scrambling to pass by July 4 could increase ICEs annual detention spending by billions, and is expected to significantly expand its detention capacity.\n\nICE has legal authority to detain people who either are in removal proceedings or face removal orders. Detention requirements were expanded under the Laken Riley Act, passed earlier this year, requiring officers to detain individuals arrested for certain crimes even if theyre not yet convicted.\n\nOptions for detention include partnering with state and local governments. ICE is also expanding no-bid contracts with private prison companies to free up more detention space. In places like Burlington, Massachusetts, a number of detainees have been held for days at a time in an ICE field office thats normally used for administrative work, according to local news reports. ICE did not respond to requests for clarification.\n\nJacob Turcotte/Staff\n\nIra Mehlman, media director at the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform, supports the role of detention facilities. If youre going to have any meaningful way of actually executing [deportation] orders, then you have to keep people detained, so youre sure that they can be removed, he says.\n\nWhat are the conditions like at these centers?\n\nThe spike in ICE arrests has led to widespread complaints of overcrowding in detention centers, including allegations of unsanitary and sometimes unsafe conditions. In Burlington, lawyers told local media their clients lacked access to showers and sufficient food.\n\nDHS says claims of overcrowding in ICE facilities are false, and that ICE has higher quality standards for its facilities than most U.S. detention spaces.\n\nConditions for detained immigrants have always been bad, says Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project. But she says theyve gotten worse under the second Trump administration.\n\nImmigrants are in civil detention; they are not serving time for criminal offenses, says Ms. Cho. Placing them in prisons is basically subjecting people to unconstitutional punishment.\n\nAs of June 15, there were 56,397 individuals in ICE detention  the most since a previous high during the first Trump term, reports Austin Kocher, a researcher at Syracuse University. Just over half  54% of those detainees  had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. The rest were immigration violators who did not have criminal convictions or charges known to ICE, according to the agency.\n\nDaniel Kozin/AP An aerial photo shows the new immigration detention facility with heavy-duty tents, trailers, and other temporary buildings put up at an airfield in the Big Cypress National Preserve, June 27, 2025.\n\nWhat kind of oversight do detention centers have?\n\nEach ICE detention center is governed by internal standards that encompass food service, medical care, and the availability of legal materials.\n\nICE conducts internal inspections of its detention facilities, which are usually preannounced. The DHS inspector general also conducts unannounced visits. Others who can conduct inspections include the Government Accountability Office and members of Congress.\n\nCongressional oversight was put in the spotlight in May, when a confrontation broke out as a group of Democratic officials tried to inspect a recently reopened ICE detention center in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka was asked by federal officials to leave after he had entered through the gate. Federal agents then arrested him. The New Jersey U.S. Attorneys Office dropped the charges 10 days later.\n\nA federal grand jury subsequently indicted New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was also at the facility, on criminal charges for allegedly striking federal officials at the scene. Representative McIver has called the proceedings political intimidation.\n\nLegally, members of Congress are authorized to conduct oversight of any ICE facility used to detain migrants without providing prior notice of the intent to enter.\n\nIts enormously important to be able to provide short-notice visits to facilities to be able to capture the actual human rights violations that are occurring, says Holly Cooper, co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California, Davis School of Law. Because with notice comes cleanup, comes transferring of people.\n\nHow does ICE work with the private sector to detain migrants?\n\nAs of January 2025, some 86% of ICE detainees were held in facilities run by for-profit entities. The two major players in private immigration detention are private prison companies, The Geo Group and CoreCivic.\n\nBoth have signed new detention facility contracts with ICE since Mr. Trumps inauguration. And stock prices for each soared in the days after Mr. Trump was elected.\n\nGovernment cooperation with private prison companies isnt new  tens of thousands of immigrants were held in private detention centers under both the Obama and Biden administrations, although both also pursued policies to phase out contracts with private prisons."

        "content": "So many shoelaces lie in the dirt. Robert Ardovino cant collect them all.\n\nHe says hes picked up thousands on his property over the past few years. Along with abandoned belts.\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol makes people remove these items when apprehended on the southern border. The practice is meant to prevent migrants from hurting others or themselves. Many have crossed into the United States illegally through this stretch of desert in Sunland Park, New Mexico. Mr. Ardovino, a business owner, finds all sorts of things theyve left behind  purses, trash, a toothbrush.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Illegal border crossings between Mexico and the U.S. have dropped to historic lows, yet left-behind items linger. One property owner ponders border security through the objects left on his property.\n\nWhat would it take for me and my family to literally walk out the door with toothpaste in my back pocket? he says.\n\nMr. Ardovino often reflects on the meaning of the items left behind. Shoelaces and belts spiked as illegal border crossings hit historic highs during the Biden administration. With the border quiet now, since the return of President Donald Trump, hes pondering how to memorialize what transpired on his land. He envisions an art project. Perhaps some message on empathy, he says.\n\nOn an afternoon in May, Mr. Ardovino revs up his utility vehicle and drives off-road. Hes trailed by Cha Cha, Sadie, and Waldo, three dogs.\n\nBehind him is a restaurant that he co-owns, where handmade pasta is a popular request. Jasmine tints the air sweet outside this place, Ardovinos Desert Crossing and Roadside Inn.\n\nI put crossing in there for a reason, he says. Its always been a migration point.\n\nRiley Robinson/Staff Robert Ardovino drives on his property May 1, 2025, in Sunland Park, New Mexico. Mr. Ardovinos restaurant and vacation rental business abuts the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMr. Ardovino grew up in the area, on the west side of El Paso, Texas. He calls Ciudad Jurez, just south of the border, a sister city. In high school, hed walk down to Jurez to grab a burrito for lunch. Like so many locals, hes seen migration as a fact of life.\n\nOriginally, Mr. Ardovinos establishment was run by a great-uncle who emigrated from Italy. The familys 35 acres sit beneath a local landmark, Mount Cristo Rey, where a limestone statue of Jesus stands on a cross, arms out.\n\nIn front of Mr. Ardovino snakes the slatted border wall. A green-and-white Border Patrol vehicle has been rumbling through his property. The U.S. Army just moved into newly formed national defense areas nearby, set up to allow the military to detain unauthorized immigrants for trespassing. Up on a mesa, what appears to be an armored Stryker vehicle adds a new dimension to his view.\n\nMr. Ardovino still finds leftover shoelaces to collect  grays, blacks, blues  curled in the dirt. He stops and grabs a handful, giving rise to fine dust. He shakes his head at a sun-bleached teddy bear.\n\nIts hard when you see people  like entire families  with absolutely nothing, trying to get here, he says.\n\nSOURCE: Map data from OpenStreetMap | Jacob Turcotte/Staff\n\nOn the whole, to him, migration is complicated. He watched uncomfortably as illegal border crossings became what he calls a business. Immigration officials say cartels often control who crosses when and where.\n\nThere have also been strains to his own business, like cuts made to his fencing so migrants can pass. Over the past 25 years on the land, though, he says hes felt danger once: when he encountered what appeared to be a coyote, or smuggler, waiting for migrants in a car.\n\nMany border crossers, he says, dont want to cause a problem. ... They want to keep moving. Theres processing plants in Ohio that are ready to hire them.\n\nHis idea for an art project is still taking shape.\n\nFor now, he loops the laces through a chain-link fence, tallying lives that went north."

        "content": "Following the U.S. attack on Irans primary nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, Tehran faces nothing but bad options. Militarily, Iran can escalate the conflict by attacking U.S. forces and allies in the region, as it did on Monday with missile attacks on U.S. bases in Qatar and Iraq. Iran could also close the Strait of Hormuz, withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty or even attempt a rapid breakout run to a bomb with its residual capabilities. Each of these options virtually assures an American military response that goes far beyond Irans nuclear program, possibly leading to a targeted campaign to topple the regime, the Islamic Republics greatest nightmare.\n\nA more likely military response would therefore be for Iran to respond by continuing to attack Israel  as it did just hours after the U.S. strike  in an attempt to turn the conflict into a war of attrition that Israel can ill afford. Israel could escalate to try to end the war more swiftly and avoid prolonging losses.\n\nDiplomatically, Iran can return to negotiations but rebuff President Trumps demand for an unconditional surrender, whose terms he had not spelled out. In reality, these would likely include the complete dismantlement of Irans nuclear and missile programs and significant curbs to its regional role, along with long-term inspections and more. Should Tehran rebuff these demands, it would greatly increase the risk of further American military action, including against the regime itself  targeting military and civilian leaders and infrastructure, not just nuclear sites.\n\nAlternatively, it can essentially accede to Trumps demands, in which case it avoids direct American intervention and the war ends, but Iran loses its ultimate security guarantor  the nuclear capability  and virtually all of its leverage to seek any concessions in further international talks. The regime would also appear so weak that the probability of a domestic uprising would increase exponentially.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhichever option Iran chooses, the very future of the Islamic Republic has never been in greater peril. Accordingly, the prospects for a dramatic positive transformation of the Middle Eastern strategic landscape have never been greater.\n\nThe decades-long American effort to establish a regional coalition of Arab states and Israel, to contain Iran, will be given a significant boost, as the former gains confidence to do so in the face of a greatly weakened Iran and resurgent U.S. in the region. The dangers of proliferation, at least in the Middle East, might be greatly reduced. Israel will have demonstrated  albeit this time only with critical American assistance  that the Begin doctrine (Israeli determination to take all means necessary to prevent a hostile regional state from developing nuclear weapons) still applies. Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the three most likely proliferators in the region after Iran, will have little reason to pursue nuclear weapons.\n\nRussias and Chinas inability to provide their Iranian ally with any practical backing during the war stands in stark contrast to the U.S. and Israel and is particularly galling for Iran because of its strong support for the Kremlin during Russias war in Ukraine. Moscow and Beijing will suffer a significant reduction in their regional standing, accruing to Washingtons benefit. The Middle East will once again be considered a clearly American-dominated region, in which Russia and China will have to tread more carefully.\n\nThere are some in the U.S. who fear Mideast conflicts distract American attention from the competition with China  the only nation approaching the economic influence of the U.S. today  and Russia. But taking a direct role in this Iran-Israel conflict has not diverted American focus from Moscow and Beijing. On the contrary, it has significantly strengthened Washingtons global stature compared with both countries. China will be more hesitant to attack Taiwan now that the U.S. has demonstrated willingness to bomb aggressors against American allies.\n\nAn Israel whose enemies have been dramatically weakened, and which no longer faces an existential threat from Iran, would be in a far better position to make progress on the Palestinian issue, beginning with an end to the war in Gaza. Indeed, it would not be far-fetched to assume that Trump, always transactional, may have made this a precondition for his support for Israel in the war. Saudi-Israeli normalization will be back on the table.\n\nNetanyahu has prepared for this moment for 30 years, for the opportunity to put an end to the only existential threat Israel continues to face. From the reviled leader whose administration allowed the Oct. 7 fiasco and various outrages in domestic affairs, he now stands to be remembered as one of Israels great heroes. Moreover, a favorable outcome to the war may very well save him from what otherwise appears to have been a looming electoral defeat  which could have been followed by jail time, given the corruption charges he faces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bigger question is whether Netanyahu  whose deep understanding of Israels overall strategic circumstances no one has ever doubted  will wish to use this opportunity to crown his legacy not just with saving Israel from an existential military threat, but also from an almost equally severe demographic challenge to its own future as a Jewish and democratic state. Fordo may be gone; the Palestinians remain. He would truly cement his standing in history if he ended the Gaza war and paved the way to a resolution of the Palestinian issue.\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Trump deserve credit for taking daring action, and they must be prepared to continue doing so. This is not the time to be fainthearted but to continue pressing the advantage. They have engaged in a classic case of coercive diplomacy, the use of military force for diplomatic ends, and must see it through to the desired end: a diplomatic agreement with Iran that ensures, with an inspections regime of unprecedented intrusiveness, that it can never again develop nuclear capabilities for military purposes, puts severe limits on its missile capabilities and curtails its malign regional role.\n\nEven with a tentative cease-fire now in place, achieving an agreement of this sort will not be easy. The Iranians are unlikely to fully accede to American demands unless they truly feel that they have their backs to the wall, and even then, they are unusually effective negotiators. Persistence, focus and attention for detail, not known to be Trumps forte, will now be called for. A historic opening has been made; it must not be squandered.\n\nChuck Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security advisor, is a senior fellow at Israels Institute for National Security Studies.

Not just for the Fifa Club World Cup this year and the Fifa World Cup next year  we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based. Thank you, Eric [Trump], thank you to everyone. Thanks, of course, to president Trump as well.\n\nFifa did not provide specifics on which staff or departments would be housed in New York. It is now a tenant of the company owned by the sitting US president with the start of its biggest and most lucrative tournament next June.\n\nIt follows Fifas opening in 2024 of an office in Miami, Florida, which houses the organizations legal division and some staff responsible for putting on the Club World Cup and next years World Cup. Some staff from Fifas global headquarters in Zurich were relocated to the US to work in Miami.\n\nOn behalf of myself, on behalf of New York, on behalf of the Trump Organization and everybody that works in this building  we love you, Eric Trump said in remarks at the event.

In that meeting, Infantino presented Trump with the Club World Cup trophy, which has continued to be on display in the Oval Office for all of the presidents scheduled events in the space.

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Earlier this year, it seemed as though the final chapter of Leonard Peltiers story had been written. The eighty-year-old is serving two consecutive life sentences for the 1975 killing of two F.B.I. agents, Ronald Williams and Jack Coler, which he says he didnt commit. Having exhausted legal channels for appeal, and been denied parole, it appeared that he would die in prison. But, during the final moments of Joe Bidens Presidential Administration, Biden commuted Peltiers sentence to home confinement. Peltier is now home, at the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation, in North Dakota.\n\nWhen I called him after he got there, one of the first things he said to me was, We were at war. That war had already begun when Peltier was a child. In 1953, when Peltier was nine, Congress passed a bill to terminate his tribe, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. The governments actions were part of an attempt to end the trust status of tribal lands and the protections that came with it. The Red Power Movement, which advocated American Indian political and cultural autonomy, arose to reverse this agenda, and activists such as Peltier came to see themselves as engaged in a twentieth-century battle akin to the one their ancestors staged in the nineteenth century against the tide of western expansion.\n\nIn 1972, Peltier joined the American Indian Movement, among the more confrontational Red Power groups, which had been founded, a few years before, by Dennis Banks, Clyde Bellecourt, and others. That fall, AIM helped organize a cross-country caravan called the Trail of Broken Treaties, which ended in the takeover of the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters, in Washington, D.C., demanding the repeal of termination legislation and renewing federal treaty relations with tribes. AIM brought together fellow-travellers from different tribes who shared similar life stories and who resolved to turn back the existential threats facing tribal life. Many had been taught to feel shame in Native culture and language at Indian boarding schools; others had been hardened by prison stints or by the harsh realities of urban poverty. All were trying to create meaning out of a life that seemed robbed from them. That meant survival by any means, and, as it had for their ancestors, that sometimes meant picking up a gun.\n\nAfter the Trail of Broken Treaties, the F.B.I. also adopted tactics of war in its increased efforts against AIM. In 1973, the federal government conducted a seventy-one-day siege against hundreds of AIM members and dissident Oglalas who had holed up at Wounded Knee, the infamous massacre site on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, to protest a despotic tribal government led by a man named Dick Wilson. The government sent hundreds of F.B.I. agents, U.S. marshals, and others to the Wounded Knee trenches, armed with military equipment including armored personnel carriers and tear gas. Their opponents were armed mostly with hunting rifles. Federal forces killed two men during the siege, the first of many AIM deaths to come. Peltier, meanwhile, was sitting in a Milwaukee jail, facing a charge of attempted murder that stemmed from a different protest. He was later acquitted.\n\nViolence only increased on the reservation in the wake of the occupation. Dick Wilson set his GOON squada private militia that he dubbed the Guardians of the Oglala Nationto exact revenge on AIM and its supporters, and AIM retaliated. There were beatings and murders during what was dubbed the Reign of Terror. The increased presence of the F.B.I. in Pine Ridge didnt help matters. By the spring of 1975, Peltier had set up camp on the reservation at Oglala, offering protection to elders. A confidential F.B.I. memo described the Bureaus new function as a paramilitary law enforcement operation in Indian Country. The atmosphere in Pine Ridge was explosive.\n\nOn June 26, 1975, Agents Williams and Coler were at the reservation to serve warrants for robbery and assault, according to the F.B.I., when a shoot-out ensued. Peltier was arrested in Canada. His co-defendants, Bob Robideau and Dino Butler, were arrested in the U.S., tried first, and acquitted on the grounds of self-defense after their attorneys presented evidence of the volatile conditions on the reservation and the aggressive actions of the F.B.I. When Peltier was tried separately, several months later, a judge barred his defense from presenting similar evidence to a less sympathetic venue. An all-white jury convicted him of two counts of murder.\n\nA few months after the shoot-out, another prominent member of AIM, Anna Mae Aquash, disappeared, and was later found dead. For years, rumors circulated that she had been murdered by other members of the group who suspected that she was an informant. Peltier was publicly linked to her killing, but he has denied any involvement and has never been charged. Others suspected an F.B.I. coverup. A confidential report detailed the Bureaus likely knowledge of the murder months before the discovery of Aquashs body.\n\nPeltier spent the next five decades in federal prison, where he claims that jailhouse informants and would-be assassins presented new dangers. On the outside, his supporters raised his profile as a political prisoner, and the F.B.I. pushed back. In 2000, hundreds of agents marched in front of the White House, demanding that President Bill Clinton not grant Peltier clemency. In the two-thousands, two former AIM members were convicted of Anna Mae Aquashs murder, although an alleged conspirator, Theda Nelson Clarke, was not indicted, and the trials seemed to produce more questions than answers.\n\nNonetheless, there continued to be overwhelming support for Peltiers freedom in Indian Country, especially in the Pine Ridge reservation, where memories of the violence over a half century ago still feel fresh. The Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, in 2016, catalyzed a new era of Native activism, and, in recent years, young Native activists took up Peltiers campaign. His freedom was seen as part of a broader effort to address destructive federal policies, including the Indian boarding-school system, which Peltier was subjected to. When he crossed the reservation line this February, it was as though a prisoner of the countrys longest war had finally returned home.\n\nWe spoke, via Zoom, for several hours in the spring. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nCan you start by introducing yourself?\n\nMy father was a French Chippewa Cree from Turtle Mountain. And my mother was Lakota and Chippewa from Spirit Lake. I was raised basically here on Turtle Mountain and what was called Fort Totten, in the past, but the real name, today, is Spirit Lake. I was raised in both Nations. And were Nations, were not reservations any longer. We have opened the doors to freedom as much as we can, but we still have a ways to go.\n\nYouve spent five decades behind bars. Did you expect President Biden to release you?\n\nNo. I honestly believed that they were just delaying, and I was going to die in prison. Some people told him, if he didnt do something, it would be political suicide for the Democratic Party, because the Natives are going to move away from him. But thats not the real reason he let me gothey were looking for a way to let me go. So I told Holly [Cook Macarro, a lobbyist and activist], Ask him for clemency and ask him for home confinement. Thats how we got home confinement."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "The deadly Texas floods could signal a new norm in the US, as Donald Trump and his allies dismantle crucial federal agencies that help states prepare and respond to extreme weather and other hazards, experts warn.\n\nMore than 100 are dead and dozens more remain missing after flash floods in the parched area known as Texas Hill Country swept away entire holiday camps and homes on Friday night  in what appears to have been another unremarkable storm that stalled before dumping huge quantities of rain over a short period of time, a phenomenon that has becoming increasingly common as the planet warms.\n\nIt remains unclear why the early warning system failed to result in the timely evacuation of Camp Mystic, where 700 girls were camped on a known flood plain on the Guadalupe River, but there is mounting concern that the chaos and cuts instigated by Trump and his billionaire donor Elon Musk at the National Weather Service (NWS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) may have contributed to the death toll.\n\nThis is the exact kind of storm that meteorologists, climate scientists, emergency management experts have been talking about and warning about for decades at this point, and theres absolutely no reason that this wont happen in other parts of the country. This is what happens when you let climate change run unabated and break apart the emergency management system  without investing in that system at the local and state level, said Samantha Montano, professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy.\n\nIt takes a lot of money, expertise and time to eliminate risk and make sure that agencies are prepared to respond when a flood situation like in Texas happens. And if you eliminate those preparedness efforts, if you fire the people who do that work, then the response will not be effective.\n\nFema was created in 1979 by Jimmy Carter  precisely because states were struggling to cope with major disasters  and works closely with state and local government agencies to provide resources, coordination, technical expertise, leadership and communication with the public when they cannot cope alone.\n\nUpon returning to the White House, Trump immediately began threatening to disband Fema, belittling the agency amid its ongoing efforts to help communities devastated by the Los Angeles wildfires and Hurricane Helene, the category 4 storm that left at least 230 people dead in southern Appalachia.\n\nThe threats were followed by a pledge to dismantle Fema at the end of the 2025 hurricane season, without offering any clear plan about what would come next. The cuts are part of the administrations unsubstantiated claims that the states and private enterprises are capable and best positioned to provide most federal services including weather forecasting, scientific research and emergency management.\n\nReports suggest that more than a third of Femas permanent full-time workforce has been fired or accepted buyouts, including some of its most experienced and knowledgeable leaders who coordinate disaster responses  which can involve multiple federal agencies for months or years.\n\nEmergency management and the weather service work hand in hand. At the NWS, more than 600 people have already been laid off or taken early retirement, leading to offices across storm and flood-prone areas of the US to be short of meteorologists and round-the-clock staffing cover. The agency has also had to scale back routine weather monitoring.\n\nTwo senior meteorologists at the San Antonio NWS office, which is responsible for forecasting in the Hill Country region, were among the casualties of Musks buyouts and layoffs. This included the warning coordination meteorologist, who is usually responsible for liaising with local emergency managers to help translate NWS forecasts into likely impacts that inform local actions such as warnings and evacuation orders.\n\nBut Trump said it was unlikely the staff cuts to the NWS will be reversed, even in the wake of the Texas floods. I would think not, the president said on Sunday about a possible reversal. This was a thing that happened in seconds. Nobody expected it. Nobody saw it. Very talented people are there, they didnt see it.\n\nAccuweather, the popular commercial weather forecasting services, relies on the NWS for much of its foundational meteorological data and forecasts. Fema often steps in to cover emergency accommodation and reconstruction costs for Americans without adequate insurance and/or the means to rebuild.\n\nReports suggest NWS weather balloons, which assess storm risk by measuring wind speed, humidity, temperature and other conditions that satellites may not detect, have been canceled in recent weeks from Nebraska to Florida due to staff shortages. At the busiest time for storm predictions, deadly heatwaves and wildfires, weather service staffing is down by more than 10% and, for the first time in almost half a century, some forecasting offices no longer have 24/7 cover.\n\nIn May, the NWS office in eastern Kentucky scrambled to cover the overnight forecast as severe storms moved through the region, triggering multiple tornadoes that eventually killed 28 people.\n\nDespite such threats, the Republican budget bill signed by Trump last week cuts $150m in funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) to help improve future weather forecasts and also shrinks the amount of money to the National Science Foundation, the premier federal agency supporting basic science and engineering research, by 56% next year.\n\nThe 2026 budget makes significant cuts to Noaa including terminating the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which in essence could be the end of the efforts to improve warnings for events like the Texas floods, warned Alan Gerard, former head of the Warning Research and Development Division of the Noaa National Severe Storms Laboratory, speaking on DemocracyNow! on Monday.\n\nNSF funded research has played a pivotal role in developing early warning systems for all sorts of hazards, but more work is urgently needed to improve local accuracy and community acceptability amid the growing threats due to global heating. There is no other funding source capable of filling this gap.\n\nThe Hill Country is a desert area with big rivers which have had historic major floods and that are prone to flash flooding  but like most of rural America do not have gauge systems. Without gauges, the warnings dont come early enough, and with flash floods every 15 minutes can save lives. This is something we can do better, said Ryan Thigpen, a flood scientist trying to improve early warning systems in Appalachia .\n\nTexas senator Ted Cruz has called for a better system of warnings to get kids out of harms way in the wake of the disaster, even though he inserted language into the big beautiful bill to slash Noaas weather forecasting upgrades. Local officials, too, have sought to distract attention away from Trumps cuts  and their support for his plans  but the lack of leadership at Fema is impossible to ignore especially as Trump plans to visit the area with the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.\n\nDavid Richardson, the acting administrator of Fema, has not traveled to Texas. Richardson, a former US marine with no emergency management experience prior to his appointment in May, is most notable for his warning to agency staff to not oppose Trumps plan for Fema or I will run right over you.\n\nA lot of key people at Fema who worked there for years, decades in many cases, and hold the expertise that is needed to be able to actually move the resources of the agency, are gone. Fema is so depleted, its unclear if they are even capable of launching a huge response right now, said Montano, author of Disasterology: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the Climate Crisis.\n\nIts not the same level as during [hurricane] Helene but theres already a lot of inaccurate information out there, and Fema is no longer a trusted voice  we havent heard from the administrator, only secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, which is very unusual. Were almost at the point where we can say no ones home at Fema there is no trusted voice, Montano added.\n\n\n\nThe turmoil at the federal agencies tasked with predicting and responding to disaster comes as the threat from extreme weather grows due to the human-caused climate crisis. The Texas floods occurred in a warmer, more moisture-laden atmosphere than in the past, with one analysis finding that climate change has made conditions 7% wetter and 1.5C hotter than they wouldve been otherwise.\n\nWe have added a lot of carbon to the atmosphere, and that extra carbon traps energy in the climate system, said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. Because of this extra energy, every weather event we see now carries some influence from climate change. The only question is how big that influence is.\n\nMeanwhile on Monday the White House described the deadly Texas floods as an act of God."

On Sunday, Texass governor, Greg Abbott, said more than 40 people remain missing.\n\nMore than 100 people have now died in the floods. At least 27 of those are children. The crisis is being described as one of the USs deadliest floods in decades and has caused between $18bn and $22bn in total damage and economic loss, according to a preliminary estimate from AccuWeather.\n\nThe hardest-hit area was Kerr county, where at least 75 of the deaths occurred.\n\nMany of the victims have been identified by their relatives. Here is what we know so far about some of those whose lives were taken by the floods:\n\nCampers and staff from Camp Mystic\n\nAs of Monday morning, at least 27 girls and camp counselors from Camp Mystic, a Christian all-girls summer camp along the Guadalupe River, have died, the camp confirmed in a statement.\n\nAmong the victims was eight-year-old Renee Smajstrla, whose uncle, Shawn Salta, has confirmed her death to multiple outlets. Salta wrote on Facebook that Renee was found and while not the outcome we prayed for, the social media outreach likely assisted the first responders in helping to identify her so quickly.\n\nWe are thankful she was with her friends and having the time of her life, Salta wrote.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hanna Lawrence and Rebecca Lawrence. Photograph: John Lawrence/AP\n\nTwin sisters Hanna and Rebecca Lawrence, eight, were also among those lost, according to their grandfather, David Lawrence Jr, the former publisher of the Miami Herald.\n\nIt has been an unimaginable time for all of us, Lawrence Jr told the Herald.\n\nBest friends and cabin mates Eloise Peck, eight, and Lila Bonner, nine, both from Dallas, also died in the flood, according to members of their families who spoke with Fox 4 News and other outlets.\n\nEloise was literally friends with everyone, her mother told FOX 4. She loved spaghetti but not more than she loved dogs and animals.\n\nNine-year-old Janie Hunt of Dallas, also died in the flash flooding, her mother told CNN and her grandmother told the New York Times.\n\nA great-granddaughter of the oil baron William Herbert Hunt, Janie was remembered on Instagram by her relative, Tavia Hunt, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt. How do we trust a God who is supposed to be good, all knowing and all powerful, but who allows such terrible things to happen  even to children? she wrote.\n\nThe family of another camper, eight-year-old Sarah Marsh, confirmed to multiple outlets that the girl died in the flooding.\n\nThe mayor of Mountain Brook, Alabama, said in a statement that Sarahs passing is a sorrow shared by all of us, and our hearts are with those who knew her and loved her. Alabama senator Katie Britt said that she was heartbroken over the loss of Sarah.\n\nThe family of -year-old Anna Margaret Bellows also confirmed to Fox News that their daughter was among those killed. According to the local NBC affiliate, Bellows shared a cabin with two other missing campers.\n\nCamp Mystics co-owner and director, Richard Dick Eastland is also among those who have died, according to the the New York Times and other outlets.\n\nEastland, who had run Camp Mystic alongside his wife, Tweety, for more than 50 years, died while being transported to a Houston hospital, the BBC reported.

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Erica Lubliner is a psychiatrist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who directs a clinic that offers mental-health services to Latinos. She provides care to a wide range of patients: first- to fourth-generation immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, and undergraduate and graduate students at U.C.L.A., many of whom are the first in their families to go to college. She usually meets patients in her bright office on campus in Westwood, where paintings by Mexican artists hang on the walls and childrens books are within easy reach. But, after the ICE raids began around the city last month, she moved her appointments online. Lubliners patients are safe in her clinic, she told me, but even getting here can be scary.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nShe had heard that ICE agents had started parking outside some local hospitals. Many of her patients take the bus or walk to their appointments, and they worry that they might get apprehended on the way. Its not wise for them to leave their homes, because ICE agents have been circling and patrolling neighborhoods, she said. Many of her patients have increased their doses of anti-anxiety medication, or have started taking it for the first time. Some young patients experience intense separation anxiety when they go to school, afraid that theyll return home and their parents will be gone. Many adults ask friends and family to buy groceries for them, or to walk their kids to school.\n\nAfter ICE arrested people at their places of work, Lubliner sensed her patients anguish. ICE is going after the gardener with his truck, the workers at the car wash. The idea that they are somehow dangerous cuts at their identity in a deep way, she told me. They feel unwanted. They feel targeted. Some of her less vulnerable patients participated in protests against the raids, but others struggled with whether to take the risk. They feel guilty for not participating, and they feel helpless, and they feel afraid, but they also feel that its important to speak out because silence is not the answer, either, she added.\n\nLubliner is one of several psychiatrists and psychologists I recently spoke with who have worked with immigrant patients for many years. Theyre familiar with the psychological harm caused by past law-enforcement crackdowns and anti-immigrant rhetoric. But, as Dana Rusch, a psychologist at the University of Illinois Chicago and the director of an immigrant mental-health program, told me, This feels different than it did during the first Trump Administration. It feels different than other periods of immigration enforcement, even prior to the Trump Administration. Whats happening right now feels humanistically different. Her younger patients are asking her why people hate immigrants so much, or hate them and their families. Rusch said that she has a hard time answering these questions. (Her typical response is to talk about oppression in an age-appropriate way.)\n\nLubliner has also seen the increased emotional toll that this latest round of raids has had on her patients. During the first Trump Administration, she was doing her fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry, and she witnessed plenty of fear. Some of the kids were worriedthere was some school avoidance. . . . People were afraid to go to doctors appointments, she told me. But right now people are trapped in their homes. Its very different. Children are now having conversations with parents about what Plan B and Plan C are if they get deported. Theyre going to notaries public to write down what will happen to their children. One of her patients is so afraid to go outside that she wont throw out her trash, so she has a neighbor help her. People are being grabbed off the streets, and their family members dont know where theyre being taken, Lubliner said. Theres a level of terror I havent seen before.\n\nFor many of these patients, their fears recall past traumas: from their home countries, their journeys to the United States, and their settlement. Those who have memories of their lives in Latin America have reported experiences of extreme poverty, abuse from family members, or discrimination because theyre Indigenous. Many who recall their journeys north remember being exposed to extreme violence: murders, physical and sexual assault, kidnappings, extortion, and forced labor. Theyre forced to work in exchange for food and shelter, or theyre told that they have to work for a certain period of time in order to gain passage to the next stop on the route, Rusch told me. Thats true of the unaccompanied minors, but its also true of families whove made the journey together.\n\nThen they arrive in this country, where the threat of deportation hangs over them. Many kids experience difficulty in school, and many adults are underemployed. Food may be scarce. They hear Trump Administration officials saying that all of them are criminals and that many of them are violent.\n\nAs patients sit in her office, Rusch told me, they can sometimes recognize that theyre safe, at least compared with earlier moments. But their experiences haunt them. They have a tough time trusting people. Those are very normal responses to what youve been through, she tells them. They had to be constantly alert as they were trying to get from Central America to Mexico on foot. Now they feel the same, she said, in a country they dont know, where people speak a language they dont understand, and where their status is precarious.\n\nRuschs patients have conditions that she diagnoses as trauma and depression, but she wants to help them understand where the anxiety comes from. My patients say, Oh, I have trouble paying attention. I cant start and stop my tasks. Im just not a motivated person. Im, like, No, thats trauma, thats anxiety, thats depression,  she said. I always tell them that this is a normal response to extraordinary circumstances. If Im assessing someone for suicidality, I ask, Do you ever wish you would fall asleep and not wake up? Thats one of the first questions. Some say yes. She also pointed out that the standard methods used to assess suicide risk may not be as effective for patients who are dealing with this kind of trauma: Even the concept of how we assess risk is in some ways out of context, because theyre, like, Yeah, Ive had suicidal thoughts for three years because of what Ive been through. \n\nRusch said that many of her patients dont want to address their traumas. Instead, they want to talk about the ways they can feel empowered in their day-to-day lives: how they can get work authorization, acquire skills in a particular trade, learn English, prepare to answer questions from immigration lawyers, or earn money to send to relatives back home, which can be difficult for some to feel good about if their family neglected or abused them.\n\nThis makes sense to Rusch. If you dont have food, shelter, and safety, its hard to talk about the higher-order safety of psychological health, she told me. Its not that one is less important, but its hard to jump from one floor to the next without stairs. For this reason, cognitive behavioral therapy, or C.B.T., is one of the preferred methods for treating trauma-induced anxiety among immigrants and their families. This method aims to help patients distinguish between real and imagined fears, and, to the extent that their fears are imagined, it helps patients learn to reframe them. Its more about problem-solving than psychoanalysis.\n\nBut the fears of immigrants are as real now as theyve ever been. Families are being separated. Immigrants with legal status are being deported. Citizens are being unlawfully detained. As Lubliner put it to me, At this point, just being Latino is a risk factor. Therapists still use C.B.T. to treat their patients, but the fears and anxieties of patients like the ones Lubliner and Rusch see require modified approaches.\n\nOne of Lubliners patients is a woman whose husband was in the process of securing legal status. But, when he showed up to immigration court for a mandatory check-in, he was detained and deported. They have three children, and shes taking care of them by herself. She hasnt been able to sleep, and she has started taking anti-anxiety medication. Lubliner has also started providing psychiatric care for her children, whose teachers were concerned about their behavior in school and their inability to focus. Lubliner told me that this kind of case management, which goes far beyond regular therapy sessions, is common right now. Jenny Zhen-Duan, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and a psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said she, too, has been doing more case management than usual for immigrant patients, extending her care to connecting patients with legal services, mutual aid, and information about their rights.\n\nThe therapists I spoke with said that they encourage their patients to confront their fears directly, and they work with them to come up with a plan for what to do if the worst comes to pass. How will they respond if they are detained or deported? Who can children contact if they are separated from their parents? Where will family members try to meet up again? These conversations can be difficult, but they can also help patients gain a sense of agency, the feeling that there are at least some things they can control. I back off when needed, Lubliner said, and Im always aware that, as a representative of the medical field, I am mending past breaches of trust at the hands of the health-care system.\n\nLubliner also tries to help her patients by putting them in shared spaces with others. She runs a group session called La Pltica, where Spanish speakers can discuss their experiences with one another. Because their stories are often similar, Lubliner said, they tell each other things like Yes, what youre saying is very true, and your fear, your anger, is valid.\n\nIn these sessions, Lubliner tries to concentrate on practical things, like how to get yourself out of fight-or-flight mode, because when were stressed we cant thinktheres constant rumination. Participants meditate. They breathe together, which, she says, doesnt come naturally to many of her patients because it feels to them like being idle. She encourages prayer as a form of mindfulness, and sometimes they just sigh together, which she described as a kind of collective complaint."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "The opening scene of Get Out is a familiar horror-movie imagea stranger walking an unfamiliar street, in the dead of night, nervously looking over their shoulder at every rustle of sound. The setting is the suburbs, a frequent favorite of the slasher genre, only the victim is not a scantily clad teen girl, but an African American man, uneasily navigating what seems like hostile territory. A car pulls up alongside him, blasting the dirge-like old-fashioned ditty Run Rabbit Run. Not today, he mutters, turning around and walking in the opposite direction. But of course, his fate is already sealed.\n\nGet Out was written and directed by Jordan Peele, one half of the legendary sketch-comedy duo behind Key & Peele. That show had a remarkable grasp on the visual hallmarks of the film genres it often mimicked, and its humor often lay in the preciseness of its parody. But Get Out is no mere pastiche. Its an atmospheric, restrained, extremely effective work of horror with a clear point of view, a darkly hilarious movie that never trips over itself in search of a cheap laugh or scare. What might sound like a one-joke premise turns into something richly textured; what might seem like an easy metaphor is, in fact, anything but.\n\nLike so many horror films, Get Out is exploring the creepy menace of the suburbs. Usually, similar slasher movies exist to puncture the false veneer of safety that comes with a white picket fence, but in Get Out, the threatening vibe is present from minute one. Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is about to meet the parents of his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) for the first time and is nervous when he realizes she hasnt told them that hes black. After a long drive, their manse turns out to be exactly what you might imaginegiant, secluded, pristine, and filled with trinkets from trips around the world.\n\nRoses father Dean (Bradley Whitford) is a little too eager to call Chris my man, her mother Missy (Catherine Keener) is icy and standoffish, and her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) is weirdly aggressive, but theres nothing that unusual going on at first. Peele layers in a familiar awkwardness before slowly introducing elements of dread. The houses maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and the groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson), both black, have strangely placid demeanors; Missy is a psychiatrist who keeps offering to hypnotize Chris (just to help him stop smoking, you understand); and, naturally, theres a locked basement no ones allowed to go into (just a nasty case of mold, of course).\n\nIts best to know as little as possible about Get Outs second and third acts. Peeles plotting is as crisp as his knack for visual storytelling, and he doles out tidbits of information with glee, letting the audience slowly figure out the particulars of Roses family while they guess at just how deep the malevolence goes. Chris is on edge from minute one, understandably; behind the familys friendly surface is the kind of passive prejudice he obviously feared from the get-go. The delight comes in watching how Peele heightens that into real terror. Get Out is clearly playing on the discomfort a young African American man might have in visiting a largely white communitysomething rarely explored by the horror genre.\n\nThere are few more frightening monsters to conjure than racism, after all. Its a topic the genre has brushed up againstwith the black protagonist of Night of the Living Dead, a rare sight in 1968, or in Bernard Roses 1992 classic Candyman, in which the titular figure in part represented Americas history of slavery and repression. But racism is still a surprisingly uncommon subject matter, and Peele addresses a more insidious fearof the fallacy of America being a post-racial society, and of the nightmares one can imagine under that benign surface.\n\nKaluuya, a British actor who was extraordinary in the Black Mirror episode Fifteen Million Merits and, more recently, played Emily Blunts stoic partner in Sicario, is terrific in the lead role. Williams excels as Rose, weaponizing the lack of self-awareness she deploys so well on HBOs Girls. The entire cast is perfectly restrained, save for maybe Jones, who feels unhinged from the start, and the delightful Lil Rel Howery, who plays Chriss friend Rod, a TSA agent with the kind of moxie and deductive powers one might not expect from an employee of that particular agency. Hes a vehicle for the films biggest laugh linesbut Get Out is funny throughout, wringing jokes from even the tensest moments.\n\nBest of all, though, is that Get Out is truly frightening. Not because its loaded with jump scares (though it does have a couple of good ones), nor because it features excessively visceral violence. Its so perfectly calibrated that every escalation feels organic: What begins as an awkward tale of meeting the parents becomes something much, much worse, but its all part of a fully realized whole. Get Out is an extremely confident debut feature for Peele, one steeped in the language of horror cinema rather than merely copying it. Its also likely to be one of the wryest, funniest, most relevant films of the year."

        "content": "Taylor Fritz survived a mid-match dip, a bold fightback from his opponent and even another line-calling malfunction as he beat Karen Khachanov of Russia 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) on Monday to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon for the first time.\n\nThe American coasted through the first two sets with some imperious serving, not facing a single break point, only to dip markedly in the third to allow Khachanov back into the match. But after falling a break behind early in the fourth, the No 5 seed rediscovered his focus and played a near flawless tie-break to advance to a clash with either the defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz, or Britains Cameron Norrie.\n\nIts an amazing feeling, said Fritz, who hit 16 aces. Having played the quarter-finals here twice and lost in five twice, I dont think I could have taken another one. Im really happy Im going to get to play the semis here. Im feeling great to get through it. The match was going so well for me for two sets, Ive never really had a match just flip so quickly, so Im really happy how I came back in the fourth set and got it done. I think momentum was not going to be on my side in the fifth.\n\nThe start of the fourth set saw another malfunction in the electronic line-calling system, when a forehand from Khachanov, which landed four feet inside the baseline, was called fault. The umpire, Louise Azemar-Engzell, stopped the point, got on the phone to reset the system and the point was replayed. Though neither man looked unruffled, Fritz ended up being broken as Khachanov moved ahead.\n\nView image in fullscreen The chair umpire, Louise Azemar-Engzell, phones a friend after another malfunction in the electronic line-calling system. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nBut Fritz broke back for 2-2 and from then on, the two men raised the level and began to play outstanding tennis. The Russian held serve at 5-5 from 0-30, thanks to a brilliant lunging volley. Fritz was impregnable on serve again, though, and in the tie-break he began with a 138mph ace, hit two more and finished it off with a smash into the open court.\n\nFour years ago, after he lost to Alexander Zverev here in the third round, Fritz wrote a note on his girlfriends phone, saying: Nobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so good but 40 in the world, get your shit together. Now, hes in the top five, reached his first grand slam final at the US Open last year and is one match away from a first Wimbledon final.\n\nAt the time, my ranking was slipping, he said. I was coming back from a surgery and I felt like I was not playing to the level I felt like I should be playing. That note was never supposed to be public. I was ranting to my girlfriend about it, she said: Write it down, look at it. Im really happy with how Ive turned my career around over the last four years or so. Ive put in a lot of work and its good to see the results."

        "content": "A jury handed down a mixed verdict on Thursday for three former Memphis Police officers who were involved in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. Two of the three officers were acquitted on civil rights charges stemming from Nichols death, but all three were convicted on charges of witness tampering.\n\nTadarrius Bean, Justin Smith and Demetrius Haley were all members of Memphis' since-disbanded SCORPION unit. They were part of a group of five officers who beat Nichols following a traffic stop in Jan. 2023. Nichols died of his injuries several days later. All five former officers involved face state charges of second-degree murder, though two officers not in court on Thursday have agreed to plead guilty.\n\nWhen footage of the officers beating Nichols was released, it caused shock and led to widespread protests. Georgia State Law professor Anthony Michael Kreis said the bodycam footage showed \"a depraved indifference toward human life\" and said the beating was \"nothing short of an extra-judicial execution.\"\n\nIn the ruling on Thursday, Bean and Smith were acquitted on federal charges of violating Nichols civil rights causing death. Haley was convicted of a lesser charge of violating civil rights causing injury. Haley famously sent a photo of Nichols after the beating to several people.\n\nBean, Smith and Haley face up to 20 years in prison on their federal witness tampering charges. A date has not been set for their state murder cases."

        "content": "California National Guard members are stationed the Santa Ana Federal Building on June 18 after anti-ICE protests took place outside U.S. federal buildings in Southern California.\n\nA tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran has slightly dampened the threat that the United States could be further dragged into an international conflict.\n\nBut many Americans are approaching the Fourth of July with a sense of trepidation if not outright fear  that such a war could still be on the horizon and that there is currently an increased risk of a terrorist attack in America because of it.\n\nFor so many reasons, we are a nation on edge. Which is why we have to be careful to not allow our fears to overtake our commitment to civil rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAutocrats almost always use emergencies, sometimes real ones, sometimes exaggerated ones, and sometimes invented ones ... to accumulate power, said Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and author of How Democracies Die.\n\nNone of the political experts I spoke with in past days said they thought President Trump planned the Iran bombing for his domestic agenda  that would be really extreme. But most shared Levitskys concern that it is in moments of anxiety, when society is apprehensive of external threats, that authoritarians find the most fertile ground for increasing their domestic power  because too often, people willingly give up freedoms in exchange for perceived safety.\n\nHiroshi Motomura, a UCLA law professor who advised the Obama-Biden transition team on immigration policy, said that trade-off means the situation with Iran and Trumps immigration policy are very closely intertwined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo place is more likely to see that intersection of international and domestic policy more bluntly than California, and Los Angeles in particular.\n\nLos Angeles is a test case, Brad Jones told me, where the Trump administration is already pushing to see how far it can go. Hes a political science professor at UC Davis.\n\nThis is a very opportunistic presidency, and any opportunity that they can use to forward their immigration agenda, I think theyll take full advantage of it, Jones said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe already have the Marines and National Guard on the streets, and under federal control, supposedly because Los Angeles is in the grip of violent chaos. Although Angelenos know this is ridiculous, the courts have, for now, sided with Trump that this deployment of troops on U.S. soil is within his power. And much of America, inundated with right-wing versions of current immigration protests, is seeing on a daily basis a narrative of lawlessness that seems to justify Trumps crackdowns  including the arrest or detention of Democratic lawmakers.\n\nBenjamin Radd is a professor at UCLA, an expert on Iran and a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations. He was featured in the documentary War Game last year about how a military insurgency could play out in the United States.\n\nNot long ago  before the National Guard was deployed in L.A. against the will of Gov. Gavin Newsom  Radd was hired by a veterans group, which he declined to identify, to game out what would happen if Trump federalized the National Guard against the will of governors and turned them on the American public.\n\nAnd lo and behold, here we are now, Radd said.\n\nIn his simulation, the pretend Trump didnt invoke the Insurrection Act, a law that could further a presidents ability to deploy the military within the United States.\n\nBut in the real world, its a concern that Trump would  either because of a genuine threat, or a Trumped-up one. Rudd said that would be a big red line.\n\nIm waiting to see if this Donald Trump will actually do that, because invoking the act will be able to give him more of those emergency powers that right now are being stymied at the courts, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLos Angeles, Rudd points out, is home to a large community of Iranian Americans, of which he is a member.\n\nIts not a huge stretch of the imagination to dream up a scenario in which the government sees this community as a potential threat if the conflict in the Middle East continues, as Japanese Americans were once viewed as a threat during World War II. Rudd said he didnt see the likelihood of a mass internment, but pointed out that the government has already detained and deported students speaking out on the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.\n\nWho gets swept up in that when youre dealing with ethically diverse metropolises like Los Angeles that have a complex background and mix of people? he asks.\n\nAlready, the administration has announced the arrests of 11 undocumented Iranians across the U.S. in the last few days.\n\nWe have been saying we are getting the worst of the worst out  and we are, Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. We dont wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trumps mandate to secure the homeland.\n\nTrumps entire playbook on immigration has been to characterize immigration as invasion and immigrants as invaders, Motomura said. Having a military conflict with Iran allows Trump to link any actions by Iran or its proxies as further evidence of invasion ... and as even further proof that he must take drastic emergency measures against foes both domestic and foreign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLevitsky said that the Trump administration is clearly learning how useful it is to portray immigration as a national security emergency. He points out that the deportations of Venezuelans to El Salvador this year was supposedly necessary because it was depicted as an attack on America by members of the Tren de Aragua gang, although there was little evidence of such a planned incursion.\n\nBut the narrative of immigration as a foreign offensive has stuck  remember when shithole countries were supposedly purposefully emptying prisons and mental hospitals to send murderers and rapists to the U.S.?\n\nAnd so many people accepted whatever erosion of rights these deportations meant in exchange for the perception of living in safer communities  never mind that the reality is that most of those now trapped in that Salvadoran prison are not violent criminals.\n\nSuccess with that tactic has left the administration increasingly eager to capitalize on fearmongering and looking for ways to use language like insurgency or emergency that frees it from from legal constraints, Levitsky said. And war is a great way to do it.\n\nJones warned that even just stoking concerns that theres cells or theres people on the inside wishing to do us harm could be justification enough for more disintegration of rights.\n\nAlthough all of that sounds dire, its important to remember that it hasnt happened yet, and it may never happen. And if it does, it does not mean theres no recourse to protect our civil rights  the people still have power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isnt a single strategy, a single slogan, a single movement, a single group, a single leader, a single protest, Levitsky said. There are literally 1,000 different ways for people to express their opposition to whats going on, and whats important is that Americans engage.\n\nPart of that engagement is accepting that democracy is not a given, and that American democracy holds no special powers to survive, he said.\n\nFrankly, thats why were losing our democracy, Levitsky said. Brazilians dont have this problem. South Koreans do not have this problem. ... Germans dont have this problem. People in Spain dont have this problem. Chileans, Argentinians do not have this problem.\n\nAll those societies have a collective memory of authoritarianism. All those societies know what it means to lose a democracy, he said. Americans dont have an idea.\n\nOur greatest threat right now isnt Trump or what he may or may not do. Its our inability to believe that authoritarianism really is creeping up on us, that it could happen here.\n\nAnd that all it might take is denial with a chaser of fear to topple a democracy that once felt unbreakable."

        "content": "Voters are begging President Donald Trump to end his tweeting, and the presidents most loyal supporters are beginning to waver.\n\nAccording to a new Politico/Morning Consult poll, 69 percent of voters said Trump uses Twitter too much and 59 percent said his use of Twitter is a bad thing. A majority of voters also believe that the presidents tweets are a detriment to national security, according to the poll.\n\n[salon_video id=14777406]\n\nBut this is not a partisan issue, because Republicans are growing worried about how frequently Trump uses Twitter as well. A 53 percent majority of GOP voters say Trump tweets too much  though slightly more Republicans say Trumps use of Twitter overall is a good thing (41 percent) than a bad thing (37 percent), according to Politico.\n\nTwitter is not the only thing hindering Trumps presidency, because the presidents traditional die-hard supporters are beginning to change their tune, according to the Washington Post. FiveThiryEights Nate Silver pointed out that there has been a considerable decline in the number of Americans who strongly approve of Trump, from a peak of around 30 percent in February to just 21 or 22 percent of the electorate now. (The decline in Trumps strong approval ratings is larger than the overall decline in his approval ratings, in fact.)\n\nA poll released by Quinnipiac University on Wednesday corroborates Silvers observation, according to the Post. If you look at the trend in Quinnipiacs polling since January, strong approval of the presidents job performance has faded in a number of constituencies  including Republicans and whites without college degrees.\n\nThose who once expressed strong support for Trump Republicans, whites without a college degree, white men, 65 and older, white women, Independents and 18- to 34-year-olds  have all seen a steady decline.\n\nIts rare that opinions of people flip 180 degrees in politics. For example, when people are changing their minds about who theyll vote for, theres often a way-station at undecided before their candidate choice flips. Similarly, people are less likely to go from strong approval of what Trumps doing to outright rejection of it; instead, their approval would likely fade a bit first, the Post reported."

        "content": "HONG KONG  Chinese state media warned the Trump administration Tuesday against striking deals that sideline China, after the president announced that Asian countries would face higher tariffs starting Aug. 1, unless other arrangements are agreed on before then.\n\nIf such situations arise, China will not accept them and will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, the Peoples Daily, a state-run newspaper, said in a commentary.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said there would be 25% import tariffs on U.S. allies South Korea and Japan, 36% on Thailand and Cambodia, 35% on Bangladesh, 32% on Indonesia, 40% on Myanmar and Laos, and 25% on Malaysia.\n\nWhile Trump did not explicitly name China in the tariff announcement, he did issue an overall warning: If the goods are being transshipped  meaning they originate in one country, typically China, and are shipped to a second country before being sent to the U.S.  these middleman countries could even face higher duties. He did not specify what that increase might be.\n\nAsia has experienced a surge in imports from China in recent weeks, growing at an average of 21.7% year over year in March-April, up from 17.3% in February, according to an analysis last month by the global investment bank Nomura, which said transshipments were flowing through Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and India.\n\nWhile transshipment is a common logistics strategy to consolidate orders and reduce shipment costs, the practice is seen by the Trump administration as a tactic used by China to bypass high import levies when shipping products to the U.S.\n\nGoods transshipped to evade a higher Tariff will be subject to that higher Tariff, Trump said in letters to the countries that he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nChinese state media accused the Trump administration of sowing chaos in the trading system, with the Peoples Daily in its commentary calling the tariffs a typical act of unilateral bullying, which seriously disrupts the normal international trade order and must be firmly opposed.\n\nWhen asked about Trumps announcement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Chinas position has not changed. There are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars, and protectionism harms the interests of all parties, she told reporters at a briefing Tuesday.\n\nChina has until Aug. 12 to reach an agreement with the White House.\n\nIn his Truth Social posts, Trump began notifying the Asian countries of higher tariffs that would come into effect from Aug. 1, delaying all but 10% of his April duties.\n\nThe new deadline is firm but not 100% firm, he told reporters Monday. If they call up and they say, would like to do something a different way, we're going to be open to that."

        "content": "President Trump signs bills at the White House on June 12 aimed at rescinding vehicle emission standards enacted by the state of California.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday joined President Trump and congressional Republicans in siding with the oil and gas industry in its challenge to Californias drive for electric vehicles.\n\nIn a 7-2 decision, the justices revived the industrys lawsuit and ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over Californias strict emissions standards.\n\nThe suit argued that California and the Environmental Protection Agency under President Biden were abusing their power by relying on the 1970s-era rule for fighting smog as a means of combating climate change in the 21st century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornias new emissions standards did not target a local California air-quality problem  as they say is required by the Clean Air Act  but instead were designed to address global climate change, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote, using italics to described the industrys position.\n\nThe court did not rule on the suit itself but he said the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the states rule.\n\nThe fuel producers make money by selling fuel. Therefore, the decrease in purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels resulting from the California regulations hurts their bottom line, Kavanaugh said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson disagreed.\n\nJackson questioned why the court would revive a fuel-industry lawsuit that all agree will soon be moot (and is largely moot already). ... This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens.\n\nBut the outcome was overshadowed by the recent actions of Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\nWith Trumps backing, the House and Senate adopted measures disapproving regulations adopted by the Biden administration that would have allowed California to enforce broad new regulations to require zero emissions cars and trucks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump said the new rules adopted by Congress were designed to displace California as the nations leader in fighting air pollution and greenhouse gases.\n\nIn a bill-signing ceremony at the White House, he said the disapproval measures will prevent Californias attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions.\n\nOur Constitution does not allow one state special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire nation, he said.\n\nIn response to Fridays decision, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said the fight for fight for clean air is far from over. While we are disappointed by the Supreme Courts decision to allow this case to go forward in the lower court, we will continue to vigorously defend Californias authority under the Clean Air Act.\n\nSome environmentalists said the decision greenlights future lawsuits from industry and polluters.\n\nThis is a dangerous precedent from a court hellbent on protecting corporate interests, said David Pettit, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversitys Climate Law Institute. This decision opens the door to more oil industry lawsuits attacking states ability to protect their residents and wildlife from climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTimes staff writer Tony Briscoe, in Los Angeles, contributed to this report."

        "content": "Sean Combs, the musician variously known as Diddy, Puffy, P Diddy and Love, made a conspicuous scene in the courtroom when the verdict was read. He put his hands into a prayer gesture and mouthed thank you to the jurors, and pumped his fist in the air. A federal jury in New York on Wednesday had acquitted Combs on federal charges of sex-trafficking women, finding him guilty only on lesser charges of transporting the male prostitutes he allegedly forced the women to have sex with across state lines. The mixed verdict was seen as a triumph for Combs, who faced the possibility of life in prison if convicted on trafficking and conspiracy charges. Outside, jubilant supporters of Combs  which have in recent weeks included the provocative rapper Kanye West  erupted into celebration. Some reportedly poured baby oil on each other and yelled: Its not Rico, its FREAKO.\n\nThose triumphant chants were references to the organized group sex encounters that women  including two who testified as witnesses for federal prosecutors  have described as rapes. The women  two ex-partners of Combss, the singer Cassie Ventura and another alleged victim known as Jane  told the court repeatedly over the course of an eight-week trial that they were coerced into participating in the encounters, which Combs called freak-offs, with violence, drugs, coercive financial arrangements and threats. The encounters were filmed by Combs, and the videos were shown to the jury; in addition to the testimony of the women and the videos of what they say were their assaults, jurors were also shown security footage of a savage beating Combs inflicted on Ventura in a hotel hallway following one such party in 2016, and heard from a hotel security guard who says that Combs paid him $100,000 to destroy video evidence of his conduct.\n\nEven according to the version of events that Combs himself has admitted to, the musician is abusive, cruel, manipulative and violent toward women. He has admitted both to using drugs and to beating Ventura. But the charges he faced in the federal trial that stretched the length of two months in New York hinged on whether the womens participation in the group sex parties was consensual. They said it wasnt; Combs says it was. As they so often do in sexual assault cases, the jury sided with the man.\n\nIt is almost banal, by now, to observe that we are in the midst of a #MeToo backlash, and that the brief span  now nearly a decade behind us  when men were held momentarily accountable for their sexual abuse and exploitation of women has been replaced with a sadistic and gruesomely triumphant restoration of the status quo ante, with powerful men afforded impunity for sexual violence against women, with their supporters and fans taking vicarious pleasure in their consequence-free demonstrations of male status, and with the misogynist collective contempt of women who come forward now becoming a centerpiece of online communities and celebrity media alike. In a piece on #MeToo backlash, the writer Jamie Hood referred to the ebb of collective outrage over sexual violence as a kind of moral lethargy. But in the chanting men outside the federal courthouse on Wednesday, I see something darker and more energetic, something that is not indifferent to mens sexual entitlement and the suffering they inflict on women with it, but actively in thrall to it. Those who oppose sexual abuse, it seems, lack all conviction. Those who support it are full of passionate intensity.\n\nOutside the small circle of feminist solidarity, it turns out, no one is much moved by rape victims pain\n\nIt is true that part of the cause for Combss acquittal lies in a problem that predates #MeToo and therefore cannot be blamed on its backlash: the epistemic difficulties of abusive relationships. Abuse by men of their female partners is frequently psychologically baroque, employing tactics of humiliation, coercion, gaslighting and shamelessly opportunistic exploitation of the tendency, shared by many women and especially the young ones, to esteem themselves unworthy and broken, and to look to men to be their saviors. Such dynamics tend to produce conflicting testimony from the victims, who might say loving or forgiving things to their abusers while the relationship is ongoing that are used against them later by abuse apologists, misogynists and defense attorneys. In the Combs case, the defense team could point to text messages their client exchanged with the women in which they expressed affection and desire. To the jury, these outweighed the texts in which they said they felt forced into the encounters, tried to avoid them, or were reminded by Combs when he demanded sex that he was paying their rent.\n\nBut it is worth dwelling, I think, on what the women at the center of this case endured in order to try to make their alleged abuse recognized by the law. Ventura and Jane were subjected to grueling testimony about what they say were tremendously dark experiences. Strangers were shown videos of them having sex; Ventura was beaten, and a video of her beating went viral. The defense, meanwhile, has not been chastened by any supposed post-#MeToo cultural taboos against victim-blaming or slut-shaming. In cross-examination, the women were humiliated with lines of questioning meant to portray them as gold diggers and sluts. Intimate harms they endured, physically and emotionally, were picked over by a national audience. And after all that, the jury still sided with the man they say trafficked and abused them.\n\nIt is a central tenet of feminist politics that the unspeakability of sexual abuse is part of what allows it to thrive. In the second wave, activists formed consciousness raising circles, in which women would discuss the function of sexism in their own lives; the idea was that only by naming and articulating the violence and indignity they were subjected to could women be prepared to change it.\n\n#MeToo functioned on a similar principle: the idea was that women, by telling their stories, could find solidarity with one another. And maybe they have: one can hope, desperately, that wherever they are, Ventura and Jane are surrounded by women who are angry for them. But in #MeToo, womens storytelling had a second task. Women, it was thought, in telling their stories, could not only find solidarity with one another, but could change the minds of the reflexively misogynist world, could convince the institutions and cultures and communities that had long dismissed and mocked us to instead take our side, see us with compassion and deliver us justice.\n\nThat part turned out to be naive. Outside the small circle of feminist solidarity, it turns out, no one is much moved by rape victims pain. Instead, audiences tend to dismiss these women: to resent their displays of woundedness, to be annoyed by their demands for accountability. They want the women of #MeToo to shut up. If verdicts like this are any indication, maybe we should."

        "content": "A look at one Texas citys weather warning system, as questions swirl about the timing of flash flood warnings. Donald Trump will push back a critical tariff deadline. And conservative figures express anger over the FBI and DOJs Epstein memo.\n\nHeres what to know today.\n\nIn deadly Texas floods, one town had what some didnt: A wailing warning siren\n\nThe death toll as a result of devastating floods in Central Texas rose to at least 104 people across six counties, officials said yesterday. The majority, 84, were killed in Kerr County, including 27 campers and counselors at the 99-year-old Camp Mystic. Seven people were killed in Travis County; four in Burnet County; six in Kendall County; and one in Tom Green County.\n\nSearch and recovery efforts are still underway, though the likelihood of finding survivors is growing slimmer.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nAs the aftermath of the floods comes into clearer view, questions and criticisms have emerged about the timing of the weather alerts sent to people in the area. Some Texas officials have blamed the National Weather Service, arguing it didnt do a good enough job of forecasting rainfall and issuing timely flooding alerts.\n\nIn Kerr County, a flood watch was issued Thursday afternoon, and an urgent flash flood warning was issued at 1:14 a.m. Friday morning. Downriver in the town of Comfort, a flash flood alert for Kendall County came at 7:24 a.m. Friday  and a wailing siren urging residents to flee provided a last-minute alarm for anyone who hadnt responded to previous warnings.\n\nThere were zero fatalities in Comfort, according to Danny Morales, assistant fire chief of the citys volunteer fire department.\n\nIts impossible to know whether a siren system in Kerr County would have saved lives. The systems are meant to alert people who are outdoors, not in bed indoors, as many victims were. And many people in Kendall County were already awake and aware of the dangerous flooding when they were alerted of the threat to their area.\n\nBut Tom Moser  a former Kerr County commissioner who began looking into a warning system for his area 10 years ago, after deadly floods in nearby Hays County  believes a system would have been valuable. Records show there were disagreements among officials about the need for a siren system, and the county didnt have the funding it needed.\n\nI dont know if it could have been 100% preventable, Moser said of the current disasters death toll. But it could have been improved.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore coverage of the Texas floods:\n\nPhotos and maps show the severity of the flooding along the Guadalupe River.\n\nNBC News Morgan Chesky, who grew up in Kerrville, wrote about what its like returning home to cover the tragedy.

Cummings, who grew up in Kerrville and swam the Guadalupe River as a kid, said the tragic sight of remnants from Camp Mystic  girls Crocs, tennis shoes, volleyballs and water bottles  left him choked up.\n\nTrump to push back tariff deadline but unloads new threats\n\nA pause on reciprocal tariffs that had been set to end this week will be extended to the end of the month, the White House said, after President Donald Trump pushed the deadline to Aug. 1. The announcement from press secretary Karoline Leavitt that Trump would sign an executive order came hours after the president published two letters addressed to Japan and South Korea, threatening them with 25% duties and higher ones for items deemed to have been transshipped through their countries. Later in the day, Trump posted letters threatening duties as much as 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, 30% on goods from South Africa and 25% on goods from Malaysia and Kazakhstan.\n\nHowever, Trumps ability to impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is under court review.\n\nThe pushed-back deadline and threats represent a return to the back-and-forth, on-again, off-again state of affairs that has prevailed before and after Trumps April 2 speech announcing extreme import duties on dozens of countries. While some markets saw dips in light of Trumps threats, some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that this new round of uncertainty may not weigh as heavily on stocks this time around  though it could prove to be a setback for the Federal Reserve.

Heres how.\n\nSeveral major medical organizations are suing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over recent high-profile anti-vaccine actions.\n\nConservative anger over Trump admins latest Epstein memo\n\nA new two-page memo published by the FBI and Justice Department concluded after an exhaustive review that there is no evidence of an incriminating client list or evidence that would lead to additional prosecutions in the case of convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. The memo also concluded that Epstein died by suicide in his New York City jail cell in 2019 and that no evidence was found to suggest he had participated in blackmail.\n\nThe findings closely mirror what news outlets have reported for years, but the findings have done little to quell conservative internet and media personalities who have reacted to the memo with skepticism and anger. Elon Musk, who has recently feuded with Donald Trump, reposted a post that suggested a larger government cover-up. Several conservative personalities echoed that idea, including Mike Benz, who worked in the State Department during Trumps first term, and said he believes there is a vast deep state conspiracy. Another commentator said the memo is part of a shameful chapter in U.S. history.

After hearing concerns from home builders about the effects on their businesses, we decided to explore how the cost of building a new house could change due to tariffs.\n\nTo get the numbers we needed for a representative sample, we designed a model house, determined every material required to build it and then used trade data to identify which countries the U.S. most relied on for each item. Our interactive visualization takes readers through the step-by-step construction of a house, showing how tariffs could add thousands to home prices at a time when the U.S. is already grappling with a severe housing shortage.\n\nIndustry experts we spoke with explained that tariffs dont just add direct costs. They create downstream effects that force builders to pause projects and scramble for alternatives. As additional tariffs loom on the horizon, builders face mounting pressures to make decisions about materials and pricing. According to Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, its only a matter of time before consumers feel the effects.

        "content": "For this weeks Fault Lines column, Jon Allsop is filling in for Jay Caspian Kang.\n\nSince Donald Trump returned to office, in January, a number of controversies have appeared to expose tensions within his MAGA movement, or to alienate key members of it: visas for skilled workers (actually, that dispute flared before Trump returned to office); the decision to bomb Yemen; the fact that officials in his Administration added the editor of The Atlantic to a group chat about bombing Yemen, then tried to dodge the blame; tariffs; spending; the deportation of a gay makeup artist to a Salvadoran mega-prison; Trumps acceptance of a luxury jet as a gift from Qatar; the conspiracy theory that Jeffrey Epstein wasnt actually murdered; the conspiracy theory that files relating to Epsteins crimes havent been released because Trump appears in them.\n\nRecently, media talk of a MAGA civil war reached its apex over the question of whether the U.S. should bomb Irans nuclear infrastructure. The former Fox host Tucker Carlson, who opposed such an operation, sparred with two boosters: the current Fox host Mark Levin, and the Republican senator Ted Cruz, whom Carlson revealed to be ignorant of basic facts about Iran in a clip that went viral. Last week, as Israel attacked the Islamic Republic and Trump increasingly seemed keen to join in, MAGA personalities like Charlie Kirk expressed fear that doing so could profoundly fracture Trumps movement; Kirk polled his X followers on whether the U.S. should get involved, and, of the nearly five hundred thousand respondents, ninety per cent said No. Candace Owens, a far-right commentator, accused Trump of betraying his promise not to enter foreign wars. In response, Laura Loomer, another far-right commentator, who earlier this year persuaded Trump to fire various national-security officials, said that she was screenshotting everyones posts and going to deliver them in a package to President Trump so he sees who is truly with him and who isnt. She added, I am the loyalty enforcer.\n\nSome observers found the civil war narrative to be overhyped, however. Vice-President J. D. Vancein the past, a vocal critic of U.S. interventionismlaid down a template for any Trump adherents looking to thread the needle, writing on X that, although people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy, Trump had earned some trust to act responsibly. Later, Vance would say, on Meet the Press, that the difference between this campaign and wars past is that, back then, we had dumb Presidents. Trump had bombed Iran the night before Vances appearance on the show, and by this point headlines were suggesting that MAGA had mostly fallen in line. Opinions are like assholes, Loomer wrote, taking a victory lap. Everyone has one. Some are cleaner than others, but if you get too close to the hole, youre going to end up with shit all over your face. Kirk credited Trump with a historic masterclass. After Iran indicated that it wouldnt escalate, Carlson posted Thank God, then went back to dunking on Levin.\n\nThere are several reasons, it seems to me, why MAGA didnt ultimately tear itself in two over the Iran strikes. The way the story unfolded offered something for everyone: the hawks within the movement got to claim that Trump acted decisively to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat, while the doves, if thats the right word, got to claim that Trump showed restraint and, after Israel and Iran (eventually) committed to a ceasefire, made peace. (This dynamic is familiarbe it a reflection of political savvy or incoherenceas I explored in a recent column about how Trump has managed simultaneously to throw meat to traditional small-government Republicans and to those who see a more expansive role for the state.) Above all, perhaps, MAGA diehards understand that Trump is both the charismatic glue holding an otherwise disparate movement together and its wrathful enforcerwhat he says goes. (While the Iran story was unfolding, he waged social-media war on Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman who has opposed both the strikes and Trumps spending plans.) Two weeks ago, The Atlantic asked Trump about critics who said that backing Israels war with Iran was inconsistent with his America First agenda, and he responded that the term wasnt used until I came along, so he gets to define it. As is so often the case with Trump, this statement was both literally falsethe term dates back at least as far as the eighteen-eightiesand effectively true.\n\nThe controversies that I listed at the top of this column didnt decisively split MAGA either, for a couple of reasons. First, taken together, they havent spawned consistent factions: Loomer and Levin, for example, strongly criticized Qatari-jetgate, but enthusiastically backed Trumps decision to bomb Iran. Second, the extent of the controversies has often been exaggerated: a handful of Trump supporters have stuck their heads above the parapet, the media have sniffed drama and written up stories about friction, and nothing has ultimately changed. Its not really surprising that the broad ideological coalition put together by Trump last year would have internal disagreements, or that the movements macho energy would occasionally lead to a butting of heads. (Exhibit A: Elon Musk, who has fought with Steve Bannon, the Trump consigliere turned podcaster; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; and, of course, Trump himself.) MAGA has remained remarkably unified for a long time, through all sorts of enormous political stress tests.\n\nHappily ever after, then? Im not so sure. If the narrative of civil war among prominent MAGA influencers is often overblown, these voices do not reflect the full diversity of people who cast their lot with Trump last year, many of whom were never as fully locked in to the MAGA project as Trumps imperious post-election behavior has suggested. As The Bulwarks Will Sommer recently noted, The political threat that Trump may face over attacking Iran wont come from within the traditional MAGA movement but from the newer people hes brought into it. This includes comedians and tough guyssuch as the podcaster Joe Rogan and the comic Theo Vonwho tend to be anti-war and depend on their audiences feeling that theyre authentic, which in part means theyre not tied to any political party. Von, Rogan, and others like them have often been described as apolitical, and this assessment, true or not, added great weight to their endorsements of Trump. If MAGA influencers disagree on stuff sometimes, they all care a lot about politics. The schism that they may actually need to worry about, I think, is between the obsessives and the casuals.\n\nIts too soon to say how the Iran strikes played with the latter group. But we already have some clues, and they arent uniformly positive for Trump. Last year, the standout moment of his tour of so-called manosphere podcasts, widely cast as crucial in his greatly improved performance among young male voters, came when he sat down with Von for a conversation that delved at length into the subject of addictionVons, but also Trumps brothersand showcased Trump as both a sympathetic and empathetic human being, rare public modes for him. The interview also allowed Trump to bathe in the essential conceit that he is not part of the establishment. (Its pretty clear that the establishment doesnt like you, Von said, in one exceedingly on-the-nose exchange; Trump replied, I think the people like me.) Last week, Von, who was interviewing the Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, said that no one he knows supports the Iran strikes. I dont want people I know, my friends, getting called up; I dont want the children of my friends getting called over to die, he said. I dont even understand how its an option."

        "content": "Trump announces trade deal with Vietnam\n\ntoggle caption Luong Thai Linh/AFP Contributor/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump says the U.S. has made a trade deal with Vietnam as part of his push to renegotiate tariffs with dozens of different countries around the world. It comes as the president's self-imposed deadline for those tariff negotiations is just a week away.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump said tariffs will now be 20% on goods from Vietnam and 40% on goods shipped through Vietnam. While Trump wrote that Vietnam will pay these tariffs, that is untrue. U.S. businesses importing goods from Vietnam will be paying the taxes to the government.\n\nHe said that in return, Vietnam would \"give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade,\" meaning that \"we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.\" He specifically cited SUVs as a product that would be exported in larger numbers to Vietnam. However, the White House has not released further details on this agreement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe announcement came after Trump in April proposed a steep 46% tariff on Vietnamese imports  one of the highest rates applied to any country  saying he would address the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam. He has since temporarily set the tariff at 10%, which Trump called a \"pause,\" pending tariff negotiations between officials in Hanoi and Washington.\n\nTrade relations between the U.S. and Vietnam have grown remarkably since the U.S. lifted its economic embargo on Vietnam in 1994. The two countries normalized diplomatic ties in 1995.\n\nIn 2001, the U.S. and Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement, granting Vietnam most-favored-nation status and paving the way for its ascension into the World Trade Organization.\n\nOver the next two decades, trade between the two nations skyrocketed, reaching $149.6 billion by 2024  about a 50-fold increase since 2002.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. and Vietnam elevated their relationship to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership,\" strengthening ties that have been crucial to Vietnam's economic growth. The U.S. is now Vietnam's largest export market, accounting for nearly a third of its total exports. According to the Commerce Department, Vietnam's main exports to the U.S. include machinery, appliances, clothing and shoes.\n\nHowever, with significant trade imbalance favoring Vietnam raising concerns in Washington  the U.S. trade deficit reached over $123.5 billion in 2024 and $39.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025, U.S. officials have been pressing Vietnam to address non-trade barriers, combat fraud, and curb illegal transshipments. They also urge Vietnam to further open its market to U.S. goods and services.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Vietnamese government set an ambitious 8% growth target for 2025, but a recent report supported by the Asian Development Bank suggested that U.S. reciprocal tariffs of 20% or higher could hinder achieving this goal."

        "content": "Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John Barrasso of Wyoming return to the Senate floor Tuesday. Murkowski voted in favor of the bill but called the decision agonizing.\n\nBy a single, tiebreaking vote, Senate Republicans on Tuesday approved President Trumps signature legislation, a major step toward passage of a bill that would expand tax cuts while cutting healthcare access to millions.\n\nJust 50 Republicans supported the legislation, forcing Vice President JD Vance to cast the deciding vote.\n\nGOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in the chamber in opposition to the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legislation passed with the support of a key skeptic of its most controversial provisions: Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who persuaded Senate leadership to include several provisions uniquely beneficial to her state to secure her support.\n\nThe bill extends tax cuts and benefits first passed in 2017 under Trump that were set to expire later this year, while creating new eligibility requirements for food stamps and Medicaid, raising barriers to healthcare access that could result in 11.8 million Americans losing coverage by 2034, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe House of Representatives will now have a second vote on a reconciled version of the bill in the coming days. Should it pass, it will go to the presidents desk for his signature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut final approval in the House is not guaranteed. A bloc of fiscal hawks and a handful of Republican lawmakers in districts that rely especially on Medicaid could still sink the vote. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said he expects every member of his caucus will be in attendance to attempt to prevent passage of a bill he called a disgusting abomination.\n\nThe CBO estimates that the Senate version of the bill would add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt  $1 trillion more than the House version  over the next decade, and even more if Congress votes later to remove several expiration dates built into the legislation.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, which was founded by several GOP lawmakers to advocate for fiscal discipline, had warned Senate Republicans on Monday to make major changes to the bill to at least be in the ballpark of compliance with the agreed upon House budget framework.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts not what we agreed to, the caucus wrote in a statement. Republicans must do better. After the Senate vote, several members of the bloc criticized its version of the bill for new language on green energy, and Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana said it still included unacceptable increases to the national debt and the deficit.\n\nMany Republicans voted for the bill with reservations and out of fear of the alternative: Tax cuts affecting millions of American households and businesses passed under Trump in 2017 are set to expire at the end of the year without a congressional extension.\n\nYet those tax cuts, as well as other tax breaks and incentives for senior citizens and tip workers, are expensive proposals, cutting into federal revenues. To offset a fraction of those costs, Republicans for the first time made funding cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\nEven still, the CBO and other independent organizations assessed that the bill will increase borrowing by trillions, at a time when even Wall Street has begun to fear consequences from runaway debt.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement that the Senate bill would add $600 billion to the deficit in 2027 alone and push deficits above 7% of gross domestic product.\n\nThe level of blatant disregard we just witnessed for our nations fiscal condition and budget process is a failure of responsible governing, MacGuineas said. These are the very same lawmakers who for years have bemoaned the nations massive debt, voting to put another $4 trillion on the credit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Senate took a bill that already borrowed way too much, and took it from bad to worse, MacGuineas added.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the vote, Murkowski said the choice was agonizing, but that she had to look on balance, because the people in my state are the ones that I put first.\n\nWe do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination. My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that were not there yet, she said.\n\nCollins, who is up for reelection in Maine next year, said she supported the bills provisions extending tax cuts and benefits.\n\nMy vote against this bill stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural healthcare providers like our hospitals and nursing homes, she wrote on X. The Medicaid program has been an important healthcare safety net for nearly 60 years that has helped people in difficult financial circumstances.\n\nPolitics Trump threatens to sic DOGE on Musk as feud over megabill escalates Elon Musk, the worlds richest man, threatened to fund primary challenges against supporters of President Trumps sprawling tax and spendng bill if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate were swift in their condemnation of legislation that they believe will be deeply harmful to Republican prospects in the next election cycle, possibly costing them control of both houses of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery single Senate Republican is going to have to answer for these cruel and unpopular cuts this election, said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. This is putting their majority at serious risk.\n\nPolling shows that Americans broadly support extending the 2017 tax cuts. Other expensive programs in the bill  including additional funding for border security and defense  also enjoy public support. But polls indicate that the public disapproves of the bill overall by a double-digit margin due to its cuts to core government programs.\n\nRepublicans big ugly bill is one of the most shameful and selfish pieces of legislation I have ever seen, California Sen. Adam Schiff said after the vote. This bill will result in the closure of hospitals and clinics, kick millions of Americans off of their healthcare, slash food assistance for families, kill thousands of jobs, destroy the future of renewable energy and raise energy bills by hundreds of dollars every year  all to give a massive tax cut to wealthy people and big corporations, and to benefit polluters.\n\nAnd if that was not bad enough, Schiff added, it will skyrocket the national debt and deficit to help pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, leaving our children and grandchildren to pick up the tab. For any of the bills supporters to claim the mantle of deficit reduction or fiscal responsibility is hypocrisy of the rankest order.\n\nTrump was at an event in Florida when the vote occurred, touring a detention facility for migrants set in the Everglades. The presidents megabill also includes a significant increase in funding for border security and defense.\n\nOh, thank you, Trump said amid applause when he was told the news of the vote. I was also wondering how were doing, because I know this is prime time."

        "content": "Yesterday I praised Viola Daviss Oscars speech for being memorable without being explicitly politicalfor simply talking about her job in a moving and well-written way. Twitter quickly let me know I missed something. On social media and conservative-leaning news sites, Daviss speech had in fact sparked outrage.\n\nAfter explaining that she felt her mission was to exhume  the stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition, people who fell in love and lost, Davis said this:\n\nI became an artistand thank God I didbecause we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.\n\nThis claim has become one of the discussion items of the right-wing internet following the Oscars ceremony. Art is wonderful; art is enriching; art can connect us with each other, writes Ben Shapiro at Daily Wire. But the utter arrogance of stating that artists are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life is astounding. How about doctors? How about stay-at-home mothers, who help shape lives rather than pursuing their own career interests? How about morticians? How about pretty much everybody in a free market economy, giving of themselves to others to improve lives?\n\nVariants of that sentiment have ricocheted online, with Davis sometimes misquoted as though shed said only actors celebrate what it means to live a life, or, worse, are the only ones who know what it means to live a life.\n\nAre people right to be offended? Did she say artists are better than anyone else? Reading her words literally, within the context of her speech, and extending her the slightest benefit of the doubt, its hard to see backlash against Davis as anything other than a symptom of our overblown culture wars.\n\nAnyone might celebrate what it means to live a life in their own personal ways, but for whom is that a primary function of their profession? Artists, definitely. Clergy, maybe. Doctors save lives rather than celebrating them, and it doesnt denigrate them to say so. Stay-at-home parents help others, and Davis might even agree that thats more noble, important, and essential than celebrating the meaning of life.\n\nHer point was simply that artists serve a unique role in telling stories about the human experience, and that shes glad shes a part of that.\n\nCertainly, she could have edited herself to make a less controversial, though arguably less interesting, statement. If shed simply said, I became an artistand thank God I didbecause we celebrate what it means to live a life, complaints may have been harder to come by. The only highlights a specific way that artists are special, but it also is a dogwhistle to anyone holding strong resentment about Hollywood elitism and condescension. And theres rarely been a better time to air such resentment than right now.\n\nArtists are now treated like candidatesexpected to choose their words not for truth but for politics.\n\nOn the right, reflexive disgust for the entertainment industry has taken on new fervor under Donald Trump. During the Fox and Friends after the Oscars, the snafu whereby La La Land mistakenly was announced as Best Picture was spun by Steve Doocy as, Hollywood got the election wrong, and last night Hollywood got the Oscars wrong. Guest Tucker Carlson agreed but added that Moonlight had to win because the moralizing, politically correct establishment willed it to. Yes, the Oscars were both an out-of-touch catastrophe and an insidiously rigged game.\n\nDonald Trump has given his own interpretation of the Academys screwup: I think they were focused so hard on politics that they didnt get the act together at the end, he told Breitbart, as if the PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant who handed Warren Beatty the wrong envelope did so because hed been cackling too hard at Kimmel tweeting the president u up?\n\nLiberals may groan at Trump taking credit for his critics making a logistical mistake. But, of course, both sides see a lot of politics in entertainment these days: See all the takes making like Doocy and comparing the end of the Oscars to election night.\n\nTo many viewers on Sunday, Daviss speech seemed remarkable for how it nearly transcended partisan fray and just passionately talked about acting. But one wordonlywas enough to make her a culture-war litmus test. Maybe she wanted to pick a fight about arts place in society, or maybe she was simply portraying her profession as she genuinely sees it. Either way, it was a defiant move in an era where artists are increasingly held to the same standards as candidates for office: expected to choose their words not for truth but for politics."

Sanders reiterated that Clinton is part of a larger \"establishment.\"\n\nIn an address to the Illinois state legislature on Wednesday, the President defended his legacy, asserting that while part of the establishment he remained a progressive. \"Trying to find common ground [with Republicans] doesn't make me less of a Democrat or less of a progressive,\" Obama said in Springfield, the site where his presidential campaign launched nine years ago to the day. \"It means I'm trying to get stuff done.\"\n\nObama went on to blast the debate in the Democratic primary about who is \"not a real progressive\" as damaging. Americans should reject \"the notion that compromise is a sellout to one side,\" Obama implored the lawmakers. \"We have got to insist on the opposite: that it can be a genuine victory that means progress for all sides.\"\n\n\"So when I hear voices in either party boast of their refusal to compromise as an accomplishment in and of itself, I'm not impressed,\" Obama said. \"All that does is prevent what most Americans would consider actual accomplishments, like fixing roads, educating kids, passing budgets, cleaning our environment, making our streets safe.\"\n\nObama's comments strongly signal a preference for his former secretary of state over Sanders, who just this week criticized the Obama administration's immigration enforcement initiatives.\n\n\"I don't think there is any doubt that he wants Hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what he's achieved,\" former White House press secretary Jay Carney said this week.\n\nthe President has signaled, while still remaining neutral, that he supports Secretary Clinton's candidacy and would prefer to see her as the nominee,\" Carney told CNN on Wednesday. \"He won't officially embrace her unless and until it's clear that she's going to be the nominee.

        "content": "This weekend, as raucous parties and strident Pride marches take place across New York City, many in the L.G.B.T.Q. community are in a less than celebratory mood. At best, the vibe is ambivalent, with local political victories overshadowed by ominous national news. Trans people, in particular, are grappling with the painful political disappointments of the past year. The Supreme Court, in its recent ruling in United States v. Skrmetti, upheld a Tennessee state law banning puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors, and the Trump Administration is attempting to ban all pediatric gender-related care. Older trans individuals, too, are under threat, as the Administration now seeks to block federal funds from supporting trans health care. There are roughly two hundred and seventy-six thousand trans adults currently enrolled in Medicaid; their access to gender-affirming care may soon be stripped away, should Trumps Big Beautiful Bill pass in the Senate. Hormones and surgery costs could soar beyond most trans peoples means, forcing some to resort to alternative methods, like using underground D.I.Y. networks, or seeking care abroad. Although the Administration, with its proposed changes to programs like Medicaid, may claim that its guiding principle is fiscal conservatism, its true goal is control.\n\nIn May, more than a month before the Supreme Courts ruling in U.S. v. Skrmetti, the Department of Health and Human Services released a four-hundred-and-nine-page document casting doubt on the safety of gender-affirming care for children. The report attempts to undermine the idea that it is safe for trans children to receive hormone-replacement therapy and puberty blockers, the treatment course established by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), and which is currently endorsed by all major medical associations in the U.S. (Despite conservative fearmongering about young trans people undergoing radical medical procedures, the WPATH guidelines generally recommend that only those above the age of eighteen should receive genital reconstructive surgery.)\n\nAccording to the H.H.S. report, for the vast majority of people, gender dysphoria is simply a temporary discomfort. Perhaps, with proper care, such as counselling, they would come to terms with the reality of their biological gender. The report begins with explanations of various medical maxims: one is Primum non nocereFirst, do no harm. But counselling can sometimes be a thinly veiled disguise for conversion therapy, and conversion therapy is harm at the highest levelI know this from experience. The report technically calls for gender exploratory therapy, noting that being labeled a conversion therapist  is a damaging accusation given the professions mistreatment of gay people. But such a claim fails to acknowledge the possibility that gender-exploratory therapists may be perpetuating the same kind of mistreatment.\n\nThe H.H.S. report contradicts a previous assertion from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a subset of H.H.S., which has written that no research has displayed convincing evidence that therapy can alter a patients gender or sexual identity. It also contradicts guidance from medical authorities such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the latter of which has called the H.H.S. report inaccurate. These authorities stand by the recommended treatment protocols established by WPATH, an organization of physicians, surgeons, and mental-health professionals that emerged from an attempt to standardize care in 1979. Trump has derided WPATH for conducting junk science, and the organization has been accused of selectively publishing research regarding the effectiveness of pediatric trans care on mental health. But the H.H.S. report, which Trump ordered as a corrective, does not represent a good-faith effort to engage on the question of when and how young people suffering from gender dysphoria should be treated. Rather, in its reliance on select perspectives and a narrow set of data, in the words of the American Academy of Pediatrics, it engages in the same kind of cherry-picking that WPATH has been accused of. After enacting a ban on pediatric trans care, in 2023, Utah lawmakers commissioned an assessment of the safety of puberty blockers and H.R.T. The study recently found that these treatments are both safe and effective. But, as Chase Strangio, a trans lawyer at the A.C.L.U., pointed out in an Instagram video, the report got little mainstream-news coverage. The H.H.S., and the political right at large, have instead focussed on detransitioners. If trans people comprise a small communityan estimated 0.6 per cent of the populationthen the detrans community is even smaller. Yet the right loves to platform their stories; the H.H.S. report describes these individuals as brave whistleblowers.\n\nFor trans children caught in these political crosswinds, the stakes are high. Being called your correct name and pronouns, being on HRT, that can be the difference between life and death, Zelda, a seventeen-year-old trans boy from Louisiana, recently told the Cut. More than forty per cent of trans adults have attempted suicide, according to the Williams Institute at U.C.L.A. While the H.H.S. report does raise the alarm on trans suicide, at times it suggests the blame is on hormones, more so than a culture rife with violent transphobia. This is despite the fact that numerous reports have found that those who undergo conversion therapy are far more likely to die by suicide than their peers. In states where anti-trans legislation passed, suicide attempts by trans teens subsequently went up by seventy-two per cent, according to the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization focussed on crisis prevention for L.G.B.T.Q. youth. Some have argued that the studies have yet to directly link access to trans health care with lower youth-suicide rates, but medical care is not the only factor influencing mental healthdiscrimination, job security, stigma, and harassment also play key roles. Still, as Strangio, who represented the plaintiffs in the Skrmetti case, told the Supreme Court during oral arguments, There are multiple studies, long-term, longitudinal studies that do show that there is a reduction in suicidality, which I think is a positive outcome to this treatment.\n\nChildren are often caught at the center of the moral panic around transness. They are the testing ground for the erosion of trans rights, which conservatives often frame as a defense of parents rights. This thinking, too, is reflected in the way that the media often spotlights the voices of parents of trans kids rather than the children themselves. Right-wing stories that aim to whip up panic about an alleged trans boom tend to interview parents, infantilizing the kids as unreliable narrators. Even on the left, the voices of parents are often prioritized, ranging from spokesperson or advocate to the central narrator of their trans childs story, in a way that goes beyond the standard journalistic practice of protecting minors, given that these trans kids are often in their teens. (A rare exception is Just Kidsa recent documentary directed by Gianna Toboni about the great lengths that trans kids must go to in order to receive carewhich interviews a number of trans children and allows them to speak for themselves about the criminalization of their care.)\n\nIt is easy to deprive children of trans rights because our society generally functions as if children dont have any rights at all. We struggle to believe that these little humans are capable of making their own decisions, much less of telling us who they are. But, although conservatives might focus their public messaging around trans children, its nave to think that trans adults will be any safer from the Administrations ire. The age at which someone should be allowed to transition keeps moving: Trump recently said nineteen; other conservative critics have suggested waiting until people are in their twenties. (Of course, this would mean that no one is allowed access to puberty blockers.) But the White Houses goal isnt just no new trans kids; its no trans people, period. This is the clear takeaway from Trumps executive order Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government, which declares that sex is immutable, and withdraws all federal recognition for trans people.\n\nTrans kids are often used as a Trojan horse. An early version of the House Republicans Big Beautiful Bill proposed eliminating Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care solely for minors; a later version of the bill struck the phrase for minors. Curtailing care for trans adults was always part of the larger conservative plan. In addition to stripping away coverage for trans health care, the bill also sets stricter work requirements for Medicaidanother dangerous prospect for trans people, who face significantly higher unemployment rates. When I started transitioning, I was unemployed and reliant on Medicaid coverage. Many trans people have expressed outrage at the proposed bill: Being covered by Medicaid has given me medical support I never thought possible, the comedian Marley Gotterer told me.  Lifesaving doesnt even come close to describing it. Health care, she continued, shouldnt be about luck.\n\nIn her recent book Aggregated Discontent, Harron Walker writes about Amida Care, a Medicaid health plan in New York specifically designed to help low-income trans people. They paid for my hormones during two significant periods of my life when I couldnt get insurance through work, because no employers with those kinds of jobs would hire me, Walker told me over the phone. Its why so many of us dont have to stress about paying for hormones every month, much less other bills, and why were able to focus on our art, our work, whatever else makes up our lifebecause were not funnelling all of our attention and resources into figuring out how to get health care.\n\nThe Trump Administration is using every mechanism at their disposal to try to decrease access, Strangio, the A.C.L.U. lawyer, has said. He has suggested that, in order to build a trans liberatory project, the left must embrace a politics of solidarity. This is more than just a catchy slogan; the idea is a coalition focussed on securing material rights for the various groups struggling to safeguard bodily autonomy in our current momentimmigrants, women seeking abortions, disabled people. (As part of the Big Beautiful Bill, Republicans have also been seeking to deny Medicaid coverage for abortion and for DACA recipients.) The same executive order meant to strip government protections from trans people has recently been applied by the Department of Veterans Affairs in a way that affects a broad swath of cisgender individuals as well, owing to the removal of language that explicitly prohibits doctors from discriminating against patients for their marital status or political beliefs. Under Trumps new rules, veterans can be blocked from getting care, and doctors can be barred from working at V.A. hospitals for the sole reason that they may be unmarried, belong to a union, are registered Democrats, or identify as gay or trans, Senator Patty Murray, the former chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, wrote in a statement."

        "content": "This post reveals plot points of episode 10 of The Bachelor season 21.\n\nAccording to the fabricated lexicon of The Bachelor, the shows characters do not participate in a mere televised dating competition. They have been brought together, instead, on an emotional adventure that the show refers to, infallibly, as a journey.\n\nThe Bachelors insistence on its own vague Campbelliness is ironic for several reasons. The biggest is that, while the show does offer a kind of momentumthings proceed week after week, Rose Ceremony after Rose Ceremony, with romantic tensions inevitably mountingits participants, for the most part, do very little in the way of their own development. There are characters, yes, but very few arcs. The Bachelor or Bachelorette in question might learn some things as the season proceeds, sure; for the most part, though, the contestants are who they are, and they stay who they are. The tensions come not as those contestants grow and change, but instead as their different facets are systematically revealed to the Bachelor(ette). Different sides of their personalities are glimpsed; people are kept around or kicked to the curb based on the facets of themselves that manifest as the Journey continues apace. The Bachelor, basically, is a show that offers a lot of movement, but very little evolution.\n\nWhich made Mondays episode especially striking. First, because, at the Rose Ceremony at the episodes outset, Nick said goodbye (another term of Bachelor art) to Corinne Olympios, the seasons appointed villain. Corinne, who is dramatic and zany and materialistic and Good TV in human form, had long been a front-runner both despite and because of her antics (as SB Nation summed it up earlier this month, Oh God, Corinnes gonna win this whole dang thing, isnt she?). Her ouster on Monday, right before the Fantasy Suite dates, was a shockto viewers of the show including, but definitely not limited to, Corinne herself.\n\nWhat was doubly striking about Corinnes departure, though, was that she used the shows elaborate farewell ritual to contradict The Bachelors dynamic stasis: While being broken up with by Nick and, by extension, Bachelor Nation, Corinne demonstrated that, against all odds, she had grown. As a person! Sort of! (Id use another Bachelorism here, but of course, for this kind of thing, there is none.)\n\nThe Bachelors traditional departure sceneWoman, Weeping Alone in a Limotypically involves the said-goodbye-to contestant crying, wiping away mascara-tears, and discussing how much she wantsreally, how ready she isto find love. Not so Corinne. The woman who had spend the season defying the shows long-established norms had one more trick up her faux-fur-covered sleeve. Corinne, Weeping Alone in a Limo, told the shows invisible cameras not about how sad she was, but instead about  how changed she was. The seasons villain and cipher and punchline and living, breathing conspiracy theory used her final moments within the Bachelor spotlight to talk about what she had taken away from her experience on the show. She used them to talk not about The Journey, but about her own.\n\nCorinne, in the end, did something that is rare and almost rebellious within The Bachelors gauzy confines: She learned a lesson.\n\nIt went like this: Nick did not call Corinnes name at the New York City-based Rose Ceremony. He walked her out to the limo. Im sorry, she told him, as they embraced. Im sorry if I ever did anything to make you upset.\n\nHe replied: You never did! Listen, you never did anything wrong. Ever. You have nothing to regret. You have nothing to second guess. Look at menothing. Not a thing. You need to know that. Okay?\n\nCorinne stepped into the limo. The traditional departure ritual began. She wept, as plaintive piano notes surrounded her. Saying goodbye to Nick, she told the camera, is like, I feel like my heart is like, literally likeits never going to be repaired. I just want to feel lovedthe way its supposed to be, like the normal way.\n\nIt was all standard-issue Bachelor stuff, right down to the invocation of the normal way  until thingsas they so often will when Corinne is involvedtook a turn. Im trying to, you know, say things that men think are appropriate, she said, as her tears gave way to a slow smile. And you know what? Im done. Done trying to show my men how much I worship them and I love them and I care for them and I support them. I need that! So if someone feels that way about me? They can come and tell me. And they can bring a ring to go along with it.\n\nIt was  feminist? Sort of? It was also inflected with Corinnes characteristic self-absorption and materialism, yesand the probable result of some liberal editing, with that quick shift from weeping to grinningbut still. Corinne, with this, was rejecting the stuff of all those Cosmo stories offering advice on How to Please Your Manand the stuff, for that matter, of a culture that tends to assume that women, and women alone, should do the work of making sure that men feel supported, and cherished, and, indeed, worshipped. Corinne had spend her season of The Bachelor myopicallyeven maniacallyfocused on Nick. She had been, in Bachelorese, There for Nick and There for the Right Reasons and Not There to Make Friends. And in the end, if the aim is to be the woman before whom Nick gets down on one knee, it had all failed.\n\nCorinne took all that and then did something that is rare and almost rebellious within The Bachelors gauzy confines: She learned a lesson. She took the shows truisms about coupledom and transformed them into other clichs: Corinne will, she suggested, from here on out, Focus on Herself and Do It for Herself. Corinne will do Corinne. She will Make Corinne Great Again. Im going to be me, Corinne told the shows invisible camera, as its invisible piano played her off. And whatever happens, happens. But I will never kiss up to a man again in my entire life."

        "content": "By his own admission, the Mexican lawman known as El Diablo  The Devil  supervised a scourge of torture, murder, kidnappings, land grabs and other abuses while amassing a fortune in cartel bribes that bankrolled purchases of homes, cattle and a fleet of buses.\n\nEdgar Veytias transgressions came while he was the top cop in Nayarit, a small Pacific Coast state that evolved from a sleepy backwater to one of Mexicos most violent cartel battlegrounds.\n\nVeytia, who honed the public persona of a crusading, pistol-packing prosecutor, brazenly traveled between Mexico and the United States, confident that no one would see beyond his righteous, tough-on-crime facade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didnt think I would be arrested, Veytia testified later.\n\nHis sense of invulnerability was shattered on March 27, 2017, when U.S. agents busted Veytia at a border crossing in San Diego. This was no low-level mule who ferried drugs on his person, but a state attorney general who had facilitated cartel smuggling for years. Veytia pleaded guilty in January 2019 to narcotics trafficking.\n\nEl Diablo, however, knew where the bodies were buried  a knowledge he peddled tirelessly to his U.S. handlers. And when he testified against an even bigger Mexican narco-politician, he secured a get-out-of-jail card  before completing even half of his 20-year U.S. prison sentence.\n\nVeytia, 55, was released from prison in Februaryand is currently a free man, residing in the northeastern United States. But now he is facing some of his alleged victims in a singular legal action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Veytia committed some terrible crimes, but he paid for it in a maximum-security prison and hes trying to turn his life around  Alexei Schacht, attorney for Edgar Veytia\n\nFive Nayarit families  among them farmers, small business owners and a former police officer  are suing Veytia in federal court in Washington, D.C., under the Torture Victim Protection Act. The law, passed in 1992, allows civil claims against abusers who, while acting in official capacities for foreign governments, engaged in atrocities anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Nayarit plaintiffs say they endured torture, death threats and extortion during El Diablos reign of terror. While Veytia may have paid his dues under U.S. law, they say his mostly anonymous victims in Mexico, some long-ago slain or disappeared, merit a reckoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the very institutions meant to protect and deliver justice become perpetrators of torture and abuse, they leave citizens with no recourse, the plaintiffs said in a statement. In the face of that abandonment, we came togetheras civil societyto resist silence and impunity.\n\nRepresenting the Nayarit residents  who are seeking unspecified damages  is San Francisco-based Guernica37, a nonprofit organization seeking accountability for global rights abuses. Assisting are pro-bono lawyers and UC Irvines Civil Rights Litigation Clinic, founded by attorney Paul L. Hoffman, a co-counsel and pioneer in such international actions.\n\nVeytia denies the residents charges. His New York-based lawyer, Alexei Schacht, labels the accusers shake-down artists and fraudsters seeking a big payday.\n\nMr. Veytia committed some terrible crimes, but he paid for it in a maximum-security prison and hes trying to turn his life around, said Schacht. Its unfortunate that these people are lying about him.\n\nWhatever the truth, Veytias history of heinous crimes dramatizes the intractable nexus between Mexican officialdom and the countrys ruthless mafias. For decades, the lure of cartel cash has ensnared prosecutors, generals, mayors, governors  and even the countrys onetime top law enforcement honcho, Genaro Garca Luna, against whom Veytia testified in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nThat so many corrupt functionaries and cartel capos ultimately face responsibility in the United States  and not in Mexico  underscores a fundamental weakness of the Mexican justice system, observers say.\n\nIts one more instance of official impunity in Mexico, said Guillermo Garduo, a researcher at the Autonomous Metropolitan University in Mexico City. Organized crime and many politicians in this country are one and the same. The Veytia case is a very clear example of that, though its far from the only one.\n\nGenaro Garca Luna stands flanked by U.S. Marshals as he reads his sentencing statement during his sentencing hearing in federal court in New York. (Elizabeth Williams / Associated Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Massachusetts-sized state of Nayarit, population 1.2 million, boasts both a tourist-beckoning coast (The Nayarit Riviera) and a mountainous interior where cultivation of opium poppies and marijuana has long provided a subsistence living for some peasants.\n\nNayarits location, sandwiched between the drug-trafficking hubs of Sinaloa and Jalisco states, made it prized turf as organized crime syndicates expanded their terrain and embraced new rackets. Violence escalated rapidly in Nayarit, and elsewhere in Mexico, after President Felipe Caldern, with U.S. backing, declared war in 2006 on drug cartels.\n\nGun battles and gang killings convulsed Tepic, Nayarits volcano-ringed capital, where the homicide rate soon rivaled that of Mexicos hyper-violent border cities.\n\nThere were people hung from bridges, Veytia testified when asked to describe Tepic in those days. There were people who showed up skinned.\n\nAnd, he added, there was an especially macabre practice, a warning that evoked pozole, the signature Mexican corn and meat stew.\n\nThey were these big tins where they would put dismembered parts like legs, heads, Veytia said. And they would add some corn grains to it, and call it pozole.\n\nVeytia, who attended elementary school in San Diego  he is a joint U.S.-Mexican citizen  arrived in Tepic in the early 1990s, running a transport firm and a jewelry shop, according to his testimony. He says he later earned a law degree.\n\nVeytia hitched his fortune to the spurs of the charismatic Roberto Sandoval, a glad-handing pol in a cowboy hat who was elected mayor of Tepic and, in 2011, governor of Nayarit. Sandoval named Veytia to top law enforcement slots in both the capital and the state as the folksy politician amassed illicit riches, according to prosecutors. (Sandoval remains jailed in Mexico on corruption charges, which he denies.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVeytia, a portly figure with a bushy mustache, seemed an unlikely Eliot Ness, but he was credited with reducing violence and hailed as the terror of every criminal in a laudatory corrido, or ballad.\n\nIn fact, human rights activists say, Veytia crafted a kind of a paz narca, or narco-peace: His legions of corrupt cops didnt mess with Veytas favored mobsters of the moment  the ones lining his pockets. That guaranteed one gangs dominance. Intra-cartel warfare plummeted, but drug trafficking boomed.\n\nFrom the moment of his arrest, Veytia tried to secure favor by informing on other narcos, and in 2019 he got his big break with the arrest in Texas of Garca Luna, Mexicos security chief under ex-President Caldern. Garca Luna was a big fish ready to be fried in Brooklyn.\n\nBut during his testimony, Veytia recounted his own crimes. During his nine-year law enforcement career, Veytia said, he pocketed about $1 million in kickbacks, along with gifts, including Rolex watches, from traffickers  who dubbed him El Diablo  Veytia admitted being responsible for the murders of 10 or more people and the torture of dozens of others utilizing various methods  sometimes electric shocks, sometimes waterboarding.\n\nMexican President Felipe Caldern, center, stands alongside Mexicos Public Safety Secretary Genaro Garca Luna, left, and congressional leader Cesar Duarte, right, during a meeting of the National Security Council in Mexico City in 2008. (Gregory Bull / Associated Press)\n\nWhile testifying against Garca Luna, Veytia dropped a bombshell: He said a former Nayarit governor (not Sandoval) had told him that orders came from then-President Caldern and Garca Luna to protect the legendary Sinaloa cartel boss, Joaqun El Chapo Guzmn.\n\nCaldern, who was never charged in the case, denounced Veytias testimony as an absolute lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a jury in 2023 convicted Garca Luna of pocketing millions of dollars in bribes from the Sinaloa cartel. He was sentenced to 38 years in prison.\n\nA judge halved Veytias sentence, from 20 to 10 years. When Veytia walked out of prison in February, he had served slightly less than eight years.\n\nAccording to his lawyer, Veytia lost most of his accumulated wealth on legal fees and seizures of properties in Mexico, where prosecutors are seeking his extradition on kidnapping, torture and other charges.\n\nThe ghosts of crimes past have proved persistent. In the civil lawsuit, Nayarit residents say Veytia tortured them, threatened to kill them and engaged in systematic property theft as he inflamed a statewide culture of fear.\n\nAmong the plaintiffs are Gerardo Montoya and his wife, Yadira Yesenia Zavala.\n\nIn June 2016, the couple allege in court papers, cops waylaid them on a road, handcuffed them and drove them to see boss Veytia at a police headquarters in Tepic. According to Montoya, Veytia threatened to kill him unless he turned over a property the couple owned. Montoya said he was beaten so badly that a paramedic was called to check on him. His wife says she was sexually harassed and forced to go home and retrieve the deed. The couple says Veytia forced them to sign away the property.\n\nBefore he was released, Montoya said, Veytia warned him: If you say anything, youre a dead man.\n\nYuri Disraili Camacho Vega, a former Nayarit state police officer, said he resigned from the force fearing for his life. Camacho said he received death threats after filing a criminal complaint with federal authorities denouncing Veytias directive ordering police to protect members of an infamous crime family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon returning to Nayarit more than a year later to visit his ailing mother, Camacho said he was arrested, accused of driving a stolen vehicle, tortured and jailed.\n\nAccording to Camacho, Veytia demanded that Camacho withdraw his allegations against him  and fork over 1 million pesos, then the equivalent of about $77,000. Camacho said he was severely beaten and subjected to waterboarding, or simulated drowning.\n\nIf he didnt agree to Veytias terms, Camacho said he was told, he and his loved ones would be killed. Camacho said his family made the payment and he withdrew the complaint.\n\nIn court papers, Veytia denies it all. He accused Montoya of being a longtime drug trafficker and called Camacho a thoroughly corrupt officer who worked for the Sinaloa cartel and tried to kill Veytia.\n\nVeytias lawyer, Schacht, said the allegations defy credibility. Recalling how Veytia wielded power in his narco days, Schacht said, If my client wanted to torture you, you would be dead.\n\nSpecial correspondents Cecilia Snchez Vidal and Liliana Nieto del Ro contributed to this report.\n\n"

        "content": "A worker transports plastic waste slated for a compressor in Bentong, Malaysia, in June 2024 before the waste is recycled and sold.\n\nMalaysia has banned plastic waste imports from the U.S. starting Tuesday because of Americas failure to abide by the Basel Convention treaty on international waste transfers, in a move that could have significant consequences for California.\n\nMalaysia emerged as a major destination for U.S. waste after China banned American waste imports in 2018. California shipped 864 shipping containers, or more than 10 million pounds of plastic waste, to Malaysia in 2024, according to the Basel Action Network, an advocacy group. That was second only to Georgia among U.S. states.\n\nUnder Malaysian waste guidelines announced recently, the country is no longer accepting plastic waste and hazardous waste from nations that didnt ratify the Basel Convention, the international treaty designed to reduce the international movement of hazardous and other waste. The U.S. is one of just a handful of countries, including Fiji and Haiti, that hasnt signed the pact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalaysia will continue to accept plastic waste from Basel signatories. However, exports from those countries will be subject to pre-inspection at the nation of origin, according to the new guidelines.\n\nSteve Wong, the chief executive of Fukutomi, a Hong Kong-based global plastic recycling company, suggests it is already having an effect on shipping ports.\n\nWith scrap inventories building up at ports and yards, and no clear guidance yet on the enforcement discretion or timeline of Malaysias new system, the market for imported plastic waste has effectively frozen, he wrote in an email to people who follow recycling trends, which was shared with The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of Californias plastic waste is sent overseas. A Los Angeles port spokesman said he was unaware of the impending ban. Long Beach port officials didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAn Oakland port spokesman said that facility hasnt historically seen much volume in this commodity, so we dont anticipate any impact from this change.\n\nWorkers open the door of plastics waste shipment from Australia before sending back to the country of origin in Port Klang on May 28, 2019. A total of 3,000 metric tonnes of contaminated plastic waste will be shipping back to their countries of origin today, signalling Malaysias effort to take the lead in the global crusade against unscrupulous export of scrap. (Photo by (Adli Ghazali/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Wongs email, the coming ban has already disrupted trash export routes significantly, particularly for the plastics used in grocery bags, trash can liners and food wrap.\n\nThe scrap plastics market in Malaysia has come to a virtual standstill amid tightening import regulations and widespread uncertainty ahead of the new control regime taking effect on 1 July 2025, Wong wrote in the email. Recyclers, traders, and suppliers are all reporting minimal or no movement of plastic waste.\n\nJim Puckett of the Seattle-based Basel Action Network cheered Malaysias decision.\n\nThe recycling is doing more harm than good as only a fraction of the exports ever get recycled, said Puckett, the groups founder and chief of strategic direction. The plastics that are not feasible to be recycled are often hazardous, or contain microplastics, which are commonly dumped, burned, or released into waterways. The export of plastic waste for recycling is a complete sham and it is a relief that the U.S. contribution to this plastic waste shell game is increasingly outlawed.\n\nAccording to Californias waste agency, CalRecycle, the state exported 11.3 million tons of recyclable materials overseas to places such as Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico and Canada  in 2022.\n\nThat number includes 100 million pounds of scrap plastic. Although the Basel Action Networks numbers indicate more than 10 million pounds went to Malaysia, CalRecycles 2022 report didnt break down plastic exports to individual nations.\n\nA spokesperson for CalRecycle said that California is working to reduce plastic pollution in our state and around the world and that exports of scrap plastic have significantly declined over the last 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaria West, the agencys communications director, said that in 2018, California exported roughly 421,000 tons, or nearly 842 million pounds of plastic scrap to Malaysia. She said that number dropped 98% in 2024 to 8,000 tons, or about 16 million pounds.\n\nSeveral major waste companies in California, including Athens Services and Recology, didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCritics of Californias waste system say a 1989 state law that requires cities and jurisdictions to divert waste from landfills led to an increase in the export of waste overseas.\n\nUntil 2018, China was the major importer of U.S. plastic waste. However, after China implemented its National Sword policy  which banned the import of most plastic waste  nations began sending their waste elsewhere, often to less economically advantaged nations such as Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.\n\nAlthough some of the plastic is recycled in these nations, much of it is incinerated or placed in landfills, where it chokes rivers and flows into the ocean.\n\nWaste advocates such as the Basel Action Network and participants in the Basel Convention are working to reduce the international movement of contaminated, nonrecyclable plastic from economically advantaged countries, such as the United States, to less advantaged nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJan Dell, the president of Last Beach Cleanup, a Laguna Beach-based anti-plastic waste organization, praised the Malaysian decision.\n\nWere calling on cities, waste companies, brokers, and shipping companies to respect Malaysias sovereign law and STOP all plastic waste shipments, she wrote in an email. The plastic waste must NOT be re-rerouted to other poor countries.\n\nIn 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 54, a landmark plastic law that is designed to establish a circular economy for single-use plastic products and packaging. The law addresses the export of plastic waste and requires product manufacturers to certify that their products are being recycled or composted in ways that reduce environmental pollution and minimize health effects for people who live near where the product is sent.\n\nCalRecycle is currently working on drafting regulations that will enable the implementation of the law, but West, the agencys spokeswoman, said the law requires that for any material to be considered recycled, it must go to responsible end markets, ensuring material actually gets recycled instead of becoming waste in landfills or the environment.\n\n"

        "content": "Rev. Jason Cook, a minister at Tapestry, a Unitarian Universalist congregation, wore his traditional white collar and a colorful stole resembling stained glass when he arrived at immigration court in Santa Ana last Friday.\n\nFor several weeks, Cook and clergy members from a cross section of religions have been showing up at courtrooms in Orange County, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego to stand with immigrants during their deportation hearings. The practice was launched after faith leaders learned that many immigrants seeking asylum were being whisked away by federal agents after what had been billed as routine court appearances, and locked up in remote detention facilities without a chance to prepare or say goodbye to family.\n\nThey have sought to use their presence to comfort migrants and lend a sense of moral authority to the proceedings. They have also taken to the courtroom benches to bear witness with silent prayer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, clergy members roamed the courthouse halls in search of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. If plainclothes agents sat outside a courtroom, it was a good indication that the migrants inside had been targeted for expedited removal once their cases were heard.\n\nClergy members hand out informational fliers to immigrants arriving for deportation hearings at a Santa Ana courthouse. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nCook knows the presence of clergy wont necessarily change the outcome of the legal proceedings  though in at least one instance last month, ICE agents scattered when clergy showed up at a courthouse in San Diego. If nothing else, they hope to offer spiritual comfort, so the immigrants know theyre not forgotten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheres a big piece of [our faith] thats about welcoming the stranger, about treating immigrants with compassion and care, Cook said. Were there trying to appeal to a higher authority than ICE.\n\nMany of the immigrants being detained at immigration court are asylum seekers who came into the country using the CBP One mobile app that the Biden administration had employed since early 2023 to create a more orderly process of applying for asylum. Migrants could use the app once they reached Mexican soil to schedule appointments with U.S. authorities at legal ports of entry to present their bids for asylum and provide biographical information for screening.\n\nPresident Trump shut down the CBP One app hours after taking office in January. His administration has given ICE officials the power to quickly deport tens of thousands of immigrants who were granted legal entry to the U.S. for up to two years through the CBP One program, and is waging legal battles to roll back protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who were granted temporary parole while seeking asylum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaith leaders say the work is an extension of their services for immigrants, who often attend their churches in sizable numbers. In the past, some places of worship have opened up their doors to shelter undocumented immigrants at risk of being deported. In L.A., faith leaders have organized food drives for immigrants afraid to leave their homes, as well as vigils and peaceful marches at the downtown Los Angeles federal building.\n\nIn Los Angeles and Orange counties, the nonprofit Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice has mobilized clergy and provided trainings for court visits. In the Inland Empire, clergy members have gone into grape fields to hand out Know Your Rights cards.\n\nThroughout history, across the world, clergy and faith leaders and spiritual leaders have played a really catalytic role in bending the arc toward moral justice, said Joseph Toms Mckellar, executive director of PICO California, the largest faith-based community organizing network in the state. When they do it right, they leave space for others to walk the walk, as well.\n\nRev. Dr. Terry LePage informs a visitor with an appointment about the presence of ICE agents and of their legal rights at the Santa Ana Immigration Court in Santa Ana, CA on Friday. Rev. Page says she has attended immigration hearings nearly daily. (Myung J. Chun/Los Angeles Times)\n\nOn June 11, the Catholic Diocese of San Diego reached out to area clergy to ask for help in expanding efforts to accompany migrants to their hearings.\n\nFather Scott Santarosa, of Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish, said the letter garnered so much interest, they had to limit the number of clergy who could attend. That Friday, which also coincided with World Refugee Day, they held a Mass before arriving at immigration court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe werent planning to block or get in the way or do anything to disrupt. We just planned to be present and observe and say with our presence to migrants and refugees, Hey, youre not alone, he said.\n\nOne Venezuelan asylum seeker, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution if she is deported back to her home country, had a hearing scheduled in L.A. County in early June with her children. She arrived in the U.S. in December after entering through the CBP One app. The June hearing would be her first.\n\nShe knew she was at risk of deportation and wondered whether to attend her hearing. She shared her fears with an area pastor, who offered to go with her. On the morning of her hearing, she arrived at court accompanied by three pastors and a translator. She felt protected, she said, when the judge granted a future court hearing and she was allowed to leave.\n\nEverything went well, she said. I feel as if it was because of the Christian support that I had at that moment.\n\nCook, the Unitarian Universalist minister in Orange County, said he attends court at least twice a week.\n\nInitially, ICE agents seemed averse to confronting religious leaders, and in some cases, left the courthouse when clergy members arrived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut over time, Cook said, the agents have gotten more confrontational, telling clergy they must stay 10 feet away from agents. He said he watched one ICE agent push a clergy member against the wall after she tried to escort an immigrant out of court.\n\nMembers of the Orange County Catholic Worker community offer a silent prayer of consolation and justice for migrants who will appear in immigration court that day. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThey have carried on, he said, because the work feels important and aligned with their mission of faith.\n\nWhat we are is conscience on display for these folks, and if that triggers shame or reflection, thats a good thing, Cook said outside a courtroom, not far from ICE agents.\n\nDave Gibbons, founder of the Newsong Church in Santa Ana, said he took a break from court visits after a Central American couple he was escorting got pulled away and detained in front of their child. He broke down in tears recounting the episode for his congregation. But he was determined to return.\n\nWe believe its at the heart of the gospel, Gibbons said. Theres nothing more sacred than standing alongside those being marginalized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRev. Terry LePage, a community minister in Orange County, has attended immigration hearings nearly daily. She spent Friday morning handing out fliers that notified migrants headed to hearings of their rights and warning that ICE agents were present.\n\nThat morning, clergy members encountered a Haitian man who had been granted temporary protected status during the Biden administration. He arrived for his asylum hearing without an attorney. He wore a crisp white shirt and carried his documents in a black case.\n\nClergy leaders urged him to contact his family and let them know that he might be detained. But the man, who spoke Spanish, was sure he would be allowed to return home.\n\nInside the courtroom, a Department of Homeland Security attorney argued that the mans case should be dismissed, a request the judge granted despite the migrants pleas. Seated in the audience, Thomas Crisp, an Orange County chaplain, watched in dismay and offered a few last words of comfort: May God bless you.\n\nThe Haitian man made it two steps out of the courtroom before he was swarmed by federal agents and ushered down an emergency exit stairwell."

        "content": "For months, Donald Trump has ranted on social media and, at one point, threatened to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. Last week, he took on a new, unusual tactic: a handwritten note.\n\nYou have cost the USA a fortune and continue to do so. You should lower the rate  by a lot! Trump wrote to Powell, whom he calls Too Late in one of his less compelling nicknames.\n\nThat Trump has targeted the Fed isnt surprising. In the midst of Trumps trade war, consumers and business owners alike have expressed anxiety about the economy. The stock market tanked in April, when the president announced the highest of his tariffs, and only went on the upswing when he pulled back the bulk of his levies.\n\nThe Fed has the ability to sway the US economy through its ability to adjust interest rates. When rates are high, as they have been for the last few years, borrowing money becomes more expensive. This means higher rates for mortgages, business loans, credit card debt and more. People are less likely to invest when interest rates are high, which can slow activity in the economy. The Fed lowering interest rates would excite investors and spur economic activity, but the price could be steep in the long run.\n\nBut how much sway does Trump really have over the Fed?\n\nWhile Trumps aggression toward the Fed, particularly his personal attacks against Powell, are a remarkable departure from the relationship a US president typically has with the Fed, economists say the structure of the central bank limits the amount of power Trump actually has  at least in the short term.\n\nHistorically, the Fed has been a nonpartisan, independent central bank within the federal government. Economists have found that countries without central banks are prone to high inflation and unemployment.\n\nA central banks independence is pretty much the only thing macroeconomists know of thats a free lunch, said Jason Furman, a former economic adviser to Barack Obama. When you look at authoritarian leaders that have effectively taken over the central banks, like in Turkey, you can end up with 70% inflation rates and really, really big economic problems.\n\nIn late June, Trump told reporters that he has zeroed in on three or four people who Im going to pick to replace Powell. When the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, whose name has been floated, was asked if he would take the job, Bessent said: I will do what the president wants.\n\nThat the White House is already talking about replacing Powell almost a year out from the end of his term has raised concerns that a new appointee would act as Trumps shadow chair, or someone who has power over Powell before he leaves office.\n\nBut those familiar with the Feds structure say that a powerful shadow chair is unlikely, especially since the Feds structure encourages consensus among its leaders.\n\nWhen setting interest rates, the Fed chair doesnt act alone. The chair is one of 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which meets eight times a year to vote on any adjustments to the interest rate.\n\nThe amount of control Trump has over who gets on to the FOMC is limited. The committee has seven Fed governors who serve 14-year terms. Those governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The other five members are presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks, who are selected within the Federal Reserve system.\n\nDuring the next four years, because of upcoming term limits, Trump will have the ability to appoint two of the 12 members of the FOMC  what would be a small fraction of the committee.\n\nTheyre going to have a hard time persuading other people on the committee to go along with anything like what Trump wants, Furman said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sweet pointed out that the courts preemptive protection of the Fed chair has likely soothed stock markets, which had gone into a panic when Trump first threatened to oust Powell.\n\nPowell, whom Trump first appointed in 2018, has publicly resisted the presidents efforts to sway the Fed. He has said he would not step down if Trump asks and has said the Fed will not lower interest rates prematurely, at risk of raising inflation.\n\nIn his most pointed statement against Trumps economic policies, Powell said that the Fed paused interest rate cuts when we saw the size of the tariffs.\n\nEssentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of tariffs, Powell said. We didnt overreact, in fact we didnt react at all."

        "content": "Whats in a name? Donald Trump, for whom appearances are everything, thinks its just about the only thing that matters. He called the single major piece of legislation associated with his second term the One Big, Beautiful Bill, a hokey bit of branding that his supporters on Capitol Hill promptly turned into the official name of the measure. There are signs that he does not know much about whats in the $4.5 trillion megabillduring a last-minute lobbying session on Wednesday at the White House, Trump reportedly had to be reminded by a Republican member of Congress that the measure did in fact make major cuts to Medicaid despite Trumps promises not to touch it. But the substance is never the point with Trump; the optics are.\n\nSo it was telling that the only victory on the floor that Democrats scored during the hours of drama this week leading up to Thursdays final passage of the tax-cuts-for-the-rich, spending-cuts-for-the-poor bill was a last-ditch objection to Trumps ill-fitting name for it. The Senate had just pulled an all-nighter to vote on an array of Democratic amendments to the measureso many amendments, in fact, that, when the Senate took its forty-fifth vote on Tuesday morning, it broke its previous record for one of its so-called vote-a-ramas. All the Democratic-sponsored efforts to revise the legislation failed. But the Senates Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, insisted on one last symbolic complaint moments before the final vote was called: a parliamentary objection to Trumps beloved name for the measurewhich Schumer said was a violation of Senate budgetary rules. The parliamentarian agreed; the name was deleted from the official legislative text. This is not a big, beautiful bill at all, Schumer told reporters soon after. It is really the big, ugly betrayal.  And yet his parliamentary win could not have been more Pyrrhic; if theres one thing Americans are likely to know about this sprawling bill, its not whats in itits the catchy title, which Trump and everyone else will continue to use. Youd think, after ten years, the opposition would have learned not to fight Trump on branding; youd be wrong.\n\nBut this is not a story about the fecklessness of the Democrats. Essentially, their votes and their objections, no matter how vociferous or meritorious, did not matter. The bills passage on Thursday afternoon, just in time for the essentially arbitrary July 4th deadline that Trump had set for it, constituted not only a major victory for Trump but an illustration of the raw power he wields over todays G.O.P. Indeed, on Wednesday night, when it looked for a few hours as though a handful of unconvinced Republicans in the House might actually have the votes to block floor consideration of the measure, it was Trump personally who demanded that they back down, and took credit when they did. MAGA IS NOT HAPPY , he warned on his social-media feed soon after midnight. Before dawn, the win was his and the House had voted to approve the rule that would govern consideration of the bill. What a great night it was, he posted on Thursday morning.\n\nAs a matter of politics, the most notable aspect of the weeks rush to passage was the extent to which the bill prevailed despite the unresolved concerns of so many Republicans who publicly complained about everything from the huge increase in the budget deficit to the potentially devastating consequences of Medicaid cuts for rural hospitalsmore than enough Republicans, in fact, to have sunk the bill in both the Senate and the House had those who objected to the measure actually voted against it. On Thursday, the House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries, dedicated long passages in his speech opposing the billwhich lasted a record-breaking eight hours and forty-four minutesto reciting the objections against it that had been raised by Republicans themselves. There were almost too many examples of members such as Keith Self, of Texas, who called the Senate-passed version of the plan morally and fiscally bankrupt and then went ahead and voted for it anyway. Even in the handful of cases where voting for the measure would seem to be an obvious case of political self-harm, many did so. California Republican David Valadao, for example, represents a district where nearly seventy per cent of his constituents rely on Medicaid for their health care. On Saturday, Valadao put out what seemed like a categorical statementhe would vote no, he insisted, if the Senate bills more extensive cuts to Medicaid were kept in the final measure. But, when they were, he still voted yes. Principle No. 1 for understanding the G.O.P. in the Trump era is recognizing that, in a choice between Trump and even a congressmans most passionately professed principles, the default option is for the Republican to choose Trump.\n\nThere were many such examples of acquiescence on the Senate side, toolike that of the Republican Mike Lee, of Utah, who on June 18th warned, the deficit will eat us alive if we dont get it under control and then, days later, voted to grow the deficit by trillions of dollars. As in the House, it was not that Republicans concerns had been assuaged but that their time to acknowledge what it means to be a Republican in Trumps Washington had come. Swallow the bill, embrace the hypocrisyor quit. Thom Tillis chose to quit. As in, give up his seat in Congress altogether. The North Carolina Republican had raised concerns about the trillion or so dollars in Medicaid cuts in the bill that many of his colleagues and Trump himself pretended did not exist or were, as J. D. Vance put it, immaterial. On Sunday, after declaring his opposition to the legislation and listening to Trumps threats to bury him politically, Tillis announced that he would not seek relection next year.\n\nThe decision left Tillis free to make one of the more compelling speeches against the measure, though even then he insisted that Trump had somehow been misinformed about the cuts to Medicaid by the amateurs advising him and the harm those cuts would doa line that reminded me of my time as a correspondent in Russia, with its long tradition of maintaining that the good tsar was never responsible for the bad actions of his courtiers. Still, Tillis could not have been clearer that Trump had broken his commitment. It is inescapable, he said, that this bill will betray the promise Donald Trump made.\n\nThe decisive vote in the Senate was cast by Lisa Murkowski, who reluctantly supported the bill after Republican leaders made several concessions targeted at helping her home state of Alaska escape some of the consequences of the measure. With three other Republicans voting no, Murkowski could have singlehandedly sunk the bill; instead, she turned it into a 5050 tie, which was then broken by Vance. Unlike some of her more ostentatiously pro-Trump colleagues, she did not pretend that she was happy about it. Indeed, it was Murkowskis tormented visage after her vote that I will remember, along with the statement that she made, essentially disavowing the bill whose passage she had just made possible. She said, While we have worked to improve the present bill for Alaska, it is not good enough for the rest of our nationand we all know it. Whats more, she added, my sincere hope is that this is not the final product. This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the Presidents desk. We need to work together to get this right.\n\nThis is, of course, not what happened. She claimed to be voting for the bill with the hope that Republicans in the House would somehow have more courage than she herself had shown. Is anyone surprised that they did not? Barely forty-eight hours later, the House adopted the Senate version in its entirety. Minutes before it passed on Thursday, the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, thanked a bold, visionary, fearless President Donald J. Trump for shepherding it to victory and then proferred Trump-style magical thinking to explain away the objections. With one big, beautiful bill, we are going to make this country stronger, safer, and more prosperous than ever before, he insisted. If he had answers to the qualms of his own members, on Medicaid or anything else, I did not hear them. It didnt matterin the end, of the dozens of G.O.P. lawmakers who had raised complaints, only two voted against it in the Houseeven fewer than in the Senate.\n\nIll leave it to Tillis to offer a fitting epitaph for Murkowski, and so many other Republicans, who opted for the easy yes this week. Their spinelessness matters. A couple months ago, Murkowski made national headlines when she mentioned in an appearance back home the very real fear of retaliation that she and others felt when opposing Trump. We are all afraid, she had said. Is that the real explanation for her vote now? Even if it is, I found myself wondering, is it fair to privilege her fear over that of the many Americans she admits will suffer as a result? Trump is Trump, but without the Republican Partys capitulation and active compliance, his reckless assault on American institutions and millions of its most vulnerable people would not be possible. A reporter for Punchbowl News asked the newly liberated Tillis whether there was room for disagreement in todays Republican Party. If you have the courage to, Tillis replied. And if you dont, there isnt. "

        "content": "After a hastily cobbled together ceasefire between Israel and Iran took hold on June 24, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jubilantly declared that the existential threats of Irans nuclear program and ballistic missile arsenal had been destroyed. The historic victory, he said, would abide for generations.\n\nBut nearly two weeks after President Trump deployed 30,000-pound bombs and Tomahawk missiles against Irans nuclear facilities, questions linger over how abiding that victory will prove to be. Even as U.S. and Israeli intelligence services continue assessing the strikes, and the White House insists Tehran may acquiesce to a grand bargain for peace in the region, analysts say the hostilities were less a finale than a prelude to the next act.\n\nWorld & Nation Timeline of tensions and hostilities between Israel and Iran Israel and Iran have opened a new chapter in their long history of conflict when Israel launched a major attack with strikes early Friday on Tehran.\n\nThere will be a sequel. The war remains an unfinished project, for both sides, said Bader Al-Saif, a professor of history at Kuwait University. Israel, he added, wants to see the end of the Iranian regime or a more serious decapitation of its capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the Islamic Republics leaders, who have defied and antagonized Israel  and the U.S.  for decades, that they emerged bruised but not beaten serves as proof they should continue.\n\nRegardless of the superiority of Israeli and American firepower, theyre still there, Al-Saif said. And theyre there for the long run.\n\nIsraels 12-day campaign is the first time the long-running shadow conflict between the Middle Easts military superpowers exploded into open warfare, decapitating the upper echelons of Irans military and nuclear leadership. Israels spy service conducted elaborate sabotage operations on Iranian soil. Wave after wave of airstrikes killed hundreds of people and turned vital installations, infrastructure and city neighborhoods into piles of rubble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmoke rises from a command center of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps north of Tehran on June 23, after being targeted by Israel. (ELYAS / Middle East Images )\n\nFrom the moment Trump announced the B-2 Spirit bomber strikes, he and other members of his administration have repeated the word obliterated when describing their impact.\n\nThough an initial damage analysis expressed skepticism, a consensus emerged that Irans enrichment and weaponization infrastructure, including centrifuges and uranium metalworking equipment, was destroyed or rendered inoperable. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in an interview Tuesday with CBS News that Irans Atomic Energy Organization was still evaluating the impact at the Fordo site, but what we know so far is that the facilities have been seriously and heavily damaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow enduring the setback will be to Irans nuclear ambitions is another matter.\n\nAraghchi added that Irans peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory and that people will not easily back down from enrichment.\n\nOne cannot obliterate the technology and science for enrichment through bombings, Araghchi said. If there is this will on our part, and the will exists in order to once again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages and make up for the lost time.\n\nIranian officials put the death toll of the war at 935 people, including 38 children and 132 women; they did not specify how many of the men were civilians.\n\nThe U.S., European powers and Iran signed a deal in 2015 conditioning sanctions relief on Iran restricting enrichment of uranium to 3.67% (enough for civilian use), giving up significant amounts of its uranium stockpile and allowing the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to monitor facilities.\n\nTrump withdrew from the deal in 2018, saying it didnt go far enough, and he imposed what he termed maximum pressure sanctions on Iran. He began his second term with efforts to negotiate a new agreement; Israel began its attack on Iran as talks were underway.\n\nExperts believe Iran still has centrifuges it manufactured before the war but had never installed, as well as a stockpile of uranium enriched to 20% and 60%, sufficient for 10 warheads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBottom line is that Iran has the foundational elements that it could use to reconstitute an enrichment effort, said Eric Brewer, deputy vice president of the Nuclear Materials Security Program for Nuclear Threat Initiative, a Washington think tank.\n\nWeaponizing that uranium is a murkier prospect, he added. Israel killed 14 veteran Iranian nuclear scientists, but the know-how is likely to have remained, Brewer said.\n\nIran is clearly not willing to abandon its nuclear program, he said. Its a question of what form that reconstituted program will take, and how long Iran needs to fulfill it.\n\nPeople fold tents at an underground shelter in Tel Aviv on June 24, 2025, after the ceasefire with Iran was announced. (Ohad Zwigenberg / Associated Press)\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran has already taken steps limiting inspectors access to its nuclear program. On Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed into law a bill suspending cooperation with the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, until guarantees are given for the security of nuclear facilities and scientists.\n\nThe 12-member Guardian Council, half of whom are appointed by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, approved it the next day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing with any enrichment is likely to be a nonstarter for Trump, who says he without question would bomb any Iranian rebuilding effort. The Israelis too have threatened to strike again should they perceive a threat.\n\nBut that calculus thrusts all sides into a perpetual game of cat-and-mouse, with Iran going to ever-greater lengths to conceal its activities while the U.S. and Israel keep watching for Tehrans maneuverings.\n\nIsrael has employed a similar playbook in Lebanon. Though it accepted a ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah in November, it maintains an almost omniscient presence over its neighbor, with a raft of drones, spies, signals intelligence and artificial intelligence proving effective at sussing out Hezbollah activity. Israels military has launched thousands of attacks targeting any move by the Lebanese militant group to restore its capabilities.\n\nIsraelis refer to it as mowing the grass, and the idea is that they can do this endlessly, said Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control specialist and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey. But Im skeptical of the long-term success of this endeavor [with Iran] because you cant count on that level of penetration and access being good forever.\n\nIndeed, Iran is a more challenging target, roughly 158 times larger than Lebanon and more than 1,000 miles farther from Israel.\n\nBrewer, the nuclear proliferation expert, added that Iran would probably opt to hide new facilities even deeper underground to defend against U.S. bunker buster attacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo use the analogy, to effectively mow the grass, you have to know where that grass is growing back, he said.\n\nIran says it will respond if the U.S. and Israel were to strike again. And it has shown it can exact a price.\n\nDuring the war, it lobbed successive fusillades of ballistic missiles, and though most were felled en route or were destroyed by Israels defense network, those that got through left destruction unseen in Israel for decades.\n\nHealth authorities say 29 Israeli civilians were killed and several buildings were destroyed or so damaged they need to be demolished. Israels tax authority says more than 40,000 compensation claims have been filed.\n\nFirefighters, rescue workers and military members work at the site of an Iranian missile strike in Tel Aviv on June 22, 2025. (Oded Balilty / Associated Press)\n\nAlso, keeping Israels defensive net online is no easy task because it relies on ferociously expensive interceptors, Lewis added. When Israel depleted its supplies, the U.S. had to step in, firing a years production run of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missiles to intercept Irans projectiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts almost a war of attrition, because if the Israelis wait to intercept, then theyre on the wrong side of the cost curve, Lewis said.\n\nNegotiations with Iran are unlikely to be easy in a postwar atmosphere of distrust. In his interview, Araghchi said the door to diplomacy will never slam shut, but he cast doubt on statements by Trump administration officials that negotiations between the U.S. and Iran over its nuclear program would restart as early as next week.\n\nIn order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations, Araghchi said.\n\nAt the same time, there is little appetite in Iran for a grand deal that  as envisioned by Trump  aims to resolve all conflicts with Israel in the region, said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based Chatham House think tank.\n\nThats wishful thinking after a consequential war that has damaged Irans defense doctrine and one where Israel hasnt seen its strategic objectives met, Vakil said.\n\nWere on a time-out, and without really determined focus and deliberate diplomacy, this will be a very long intermission while both sides regroup and think about the next round."

        "content": "In 2002, The New Yorkers John Lahr visited Morningside Heights to write a Profile of the filmmaker Mira Nair, and took notice of her nine-year-old child: Nairs talkative doe-eyed son, Zohran, who exudes the charm of the well-loved, is known by dozens of coinages, including Z, Zoru, Fadoose, and Nonstop Mamdani.\n\nThe Lede\n\nReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nSometimes early observations are trenchant ones. (The charm of the well-loved!) The already sweat-drenched summer of 2025 has been defined by Nonstop Mamdani, a thirty-three-year-old left-wing state assemblyman from Queens, who, on Tuesday night, seemingly won a striking victory in the Democratic primary for mayor, defeating a former governor and lapping a field of candidates, most of whom were more established and initially better known. Mamdanis campaign said it had knocked on a million and a half doors across the citynot unprecedented in the annals of municipal politics but probably essential for an unknown. The candidate himself appeared in every conceivable media venue, from the TikTok series Subway Takes to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In the mid-June heat, Mamdani walked the length of Manhattan, from Inwood to the Battery. He beat Andrew Cuomo, the former governor, in the first round of ranked-choice voting by about seven percentage points, but, in campaign buttons and other merch visible across the five boroughs, it was a landslide. Mamdani got his central issueaffordabilityexactly right, and, with his easy smile, his ubiquity, and his steady rise in the polls, he embodied his campaigns essential theme, that life in New York doesnt have to be so oppressively hard.\n\nEven if Mamdanis victory was built on the ultimate virtue of local politicshustleit also carries an unmissable message for his beleaguered national party: be new. During the long and often difficult years since Obamas election, the Democrats have mostly worked from the top down and the inside out: the Partys past three Presidential nominees have been Obamas Secretary of State, Obamas Vice-President, and Obamas Vice-Presidents Vice-President. Joe Bidens age and fragility defined last years election, and may also threaten to define the Party for a generation. Even this past spring, Democrats in the House lost a vote they might have wonfor passage of the Big Beautiful budget-reconciliation billbecause too many congressmen had died too recently to be replaced.\n\nNow there is a glimmer of possibility. Donald Trump has, during the past six months, quite efficiently abandoned his brand as a populist for a more comfortable position as a straightforward right-winger. Trump let loose the richest man in the world in a hastily conceived blitzkrieg against the civil service; despite having spent years promising peace and America First, he ordered an impulsive bombing of Iran under pressure from hawks at home and allies in Israel; the current iteration of his Big Beautiful Bill, which is now on the verge of Senate passage, would strip millions of Americans of their health insurance in order to give deficit-increasing tax breaks to the very rich; and, though he campaigned and won the election by running against Bidens inflation, he is fixated on tariffs that would bring more of it. Trump is seventy-nine years old and has been President twice. He and his party cant run as the outsiders forever.\n\nDoes a generational change for the Democrats necessarily mean a sharp move toward the left, as Mamdanis supporters might hope? T.B.D. So far, the experiments in explicitly left-wing governanceas opposed to the principled backbenching of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezhave gone badly for the Party. In Chicago, Brandon Johnsons year and a half as mayor has been pretty disastrous, measured both by the citys mounting budget crisis and his own plummeting popularity. Chesa Boudins brief tenure as the avowedly progressive district attorney in San Francisco ended with his removal by voter referendum and contributed to the tech backlash that helped power Trumps victory in the 2024 election. (Michelle Wu, the young Boston mayor and Elizabeth Warrens former protg, offers a more pragmatic and successful model.) In New York this past spring, where Michael Bloomberg led an ill-advised stampede of the wealthy to back the lethargic and disgraced Cuomo, there was a fear of Mamdani that, at times, veered toward the hysterical: Terror is the feeling, Kathryn Wylde, the C.E.O. of Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of business leaders, told CNBC on primary day. Even Mamdanis natural ally Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed him in early June, noted that, if elected, Mamdani would need to surround himself with a more experienced staff to succeed. City Hall, Albanythese have been fortresses of political entrenchment for a century. Is this really the guyand the placefor the contemporary left to succeed where it has so far failed?\n\nIf Mamdani wins the general election in November, in which he will begin as the likeliest victor but not a sure thing, then his political fortunes and his significance to his party will hinge on his ability to actually improve what he has correctly identified as a crisis of affordability in New York. (His electoral coalition was less notably poor than it was youngCuomo performed well among both the richest and the poorest New Yorkers, but Mamdani ran up the score among those under forty-five.) Surely Trump will see him as a target. Mamdanis proposal of a rent freeze proved popular in the campaign, but Bill de Blasio froze the rent three times, and it has hardly made New York housing cheaper in a lasting way. Other ideas seem either a little fanciful (the establishment of five city-run grocery stores) or politically difficult (tax hikes). During the campaign, Mamdani sometimes appeared a little more flexible than his socialist imagehe has been interested, for instance, in ideas about how to build more housing that have germinated in the abundance movement, and in cutting red tape for small businessesbut his affordability program still has some of the haziness of the well-loved.\n\nBut political change often depends less on the tectonic movement of demographics than on the arrival of new personalities. That Mamdani would become the presumptive Democratic nominee (the final result of the ranked-choice abacus is still pending) wasnt fated at all. Other, more prominent young politicians could have sensed Eric Adamss and Cuomos weaknesses and run: the thirty-five-year-old Ocasio-Cortez; the thirty-seven-year-old centrist congressman from the Bronx, Ritchie Torres (a friend of development and a loud defender of the Israeli cause); or the practically ancient forty-four-year-old pragmatist Jessica Tisch, who, as the former sanitation commissioner and now as police commissioner, has had a major hand in arguably the two most successful city initiatives since universal pre-K: trash containerization and the continuing abatement of violent crime. Had any of them decided to run, their candidacies might have suggested a quite different kind of Democratic future. But part of political talent is recognizing an opportunity, and Mamdani saw three things clearly: that the cost of living had surpassed public safety as the citys cardinal issue, that fortune favors the relentless, and that generational change, however belated, was eventually bound to come.

        "content": "The path to Zohran Mamdanis stunning rise in New York politics runs directly through New Yorks immigrant neighborhoods, enclaves of young renters, the middle class, and subway riders. Fordham Road in the Bronx and Hillsdale Avenue in Queens are home to one of the more unlikely voter types to emerge from the 2024 presidential election: the Trump/AOC voter.\n\nLike Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Mamdani identifies as a democratic socialist. And like both President Donald Trump and Representative Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Mamdani is a natural in front of the camera.\n\nRather than wring his hands after Mr. Trumps victory last November, Mr. Mamdani put on a dark suit and tie, grabbed a microphone, and took his campaign film crew to ask dozens of working-class New Yorkers whom they voted for and why. Then he posted his man-on-the-street conversation to social media.\n\nWhy We Wrote This First-time voters and young voters turned out in droves for the New York mayoral primary. Their choice for mayor, Zohran Mamdani, may or may not herald a wider tea party-like revolt. But his win serves as a repudiation of the political establishment.\n\nHe told us, I want to talk to these people ... about my agenda and see how it goes, says Gustavo Gordillo, co-chair of New York City Democratic Socialists of America (NYC-DSA) and a longtime friend. It was an immediate hit. It was the first stark contrast with the failures of the Democratic Party establishment in that moment having no response to working-class voters who supported Trump.\n\nMr. Mamdanis unexpected victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for mayor last week signals a new way of doing politics in the Trump era. It also served as a repudiation of the citys political establishment.\n\nNew York has had socialists win public office before, but Mr. Mamdani is the first major DSA candidate with crossover appeal. He won majorities of voters in conservative outer boroughs with sizable Asian populations, wealthy liberal strongholds, and rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods thanks to charisma, slick ads, and a political message that emphasized New Yorkers economic insecurities. Most significantly, his campaign brought many first-time voters to the polls, including many young people. When the ranked choice results were released July 1, Mr. Mamdani had handily beaten the former governor 56% to 44%.\n\nIts too early to say whether the race will portend a fundamental reordering of the Democratic Party similar to the tea party revolt that upended Republican incumbents and set the stage for Mr. Trumps rise. Mr. Mamdani, who would be the citys first Muslim mayor, still has to face current Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent; Republican Curtis Sliwa; and perhaps Mr. Cuomo again in the general election. New Yorks Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, both have declined to endorse him. Mr. Jeffries said Mr. Mamdani would have to convince voters he is prepared to aggressively address the rise in antisemitism in the city.\n\nHeather Khalifa/AP Supporters of Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani cheer while he speaks at his primary election party June 25, 2025, in New York.\n\nBut his allies are confident, especially if all three opponents remain in the race.\n\nI cant think of another candidate who has taken video communication as seriously as he has, to do political education for the public and put the campaign message forward, Mr. Gordillo says. Zohran is a very talented communicator, but its not just the style and the communication chops that were enough. The fact that he actually had a working-class agenda was really the secret sauce.\n\nWashington, for its part, is alarmed.\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand accused Mr. Mamdani of endorsing violent rhetoric and making past statements in support of a global intifada after he declined to condemn the phrase in a podcast interview. Rep. Laura Gillen of Nassau County called Mr. Mamdani too extreme to lead the city and the absolute wrong choice for New York.\n\nThose were just the Democrats. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene posted a doctored photo of a burqa over the Statue of Liberty. Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging her to denaturalize and deport Mr. Mamdani. And President Trump called Mr. Mamdani a 100% Communist Lunatic and threatened to halt federal funding for the city if he didnt behave.\n\nA hostile voter was merely an opportunity\n\nCommunication, talent, and radical politics run in the family.\n\nIn 1991, Mahmoud Mamdani, a Ugandan intellectual who established the countrys first independent research organization, married Mira Nair, an Oscar-nominated Indian filmmaker. She released her groundbreaking romantic comedy, Mississippi Masala, that September. One month later, their son Zohran was born.\n\nThe family stayed in Uganda for five more years and then moved to South Africa. In 1999, Mahmoud Mamdani accepted an appointment at Columbia University, and the family decamped to the Upper West Side.\n\nZohran Mamdani was accepted to the prestigious Bronx High School of Science, one of the citys most rigorous public high schools.\n\nKenny Burgos, a Bronx Science classmate who served in the State Assembly with Mr. Mamdani, says students were plugged into local and national politics such as the inauguration of Barack Obama and the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.\n\nWe were all just young kids trying to figure it out in a privileged school of students who wanted to be successful and change the world, he says.\n\nAurore Marechal/Sipa USA/AP/File Oscar-nominated director Mira Nair and Zohran Mamdani attend the premiere of Queen of Katwe as part of the BFI London Film Festival in London, Oct. 9, 2016. Mr. Mamdani stunned the New York political establishment by defeating former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary.\n\nMr. Mamdani started the schools first cricket team, co-edited its newspaper, and ran for student body vice president. He lost but later said the school helped him leave his privileged bubble and changed his understanding of New York.\n\nHad I gone to a private high school in New York City, I dont think I would have ended up on the same kind of path I am now in terms of the way that I think about things especially to do with class and race, he said in an interview.\n\nMr. Mamdani attended Bowdoin College in Maine, where he majored in Africana studies and started a chapter of the group Students for Justice in Palestine. He moved to Queens after graduating in 2014 and began working as a counselor to prevent foreclosures. Deeply inspired by Bernie Sanders outsider presidential run in 2016, Mr. Mamdani joined DSA and worked on several campaigns in Southern Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nHe quickly became known in leftist circles for his fastidiousness as a grassroots organizer. Ross Barkan, a journalist who ran for the state Senate and hired Mr. Mamdani as his field director, wrote, He himself was something of a master canvasser, able to charm even the frothing MAGA men at the doors who were still, out of laziness or spite, registered as Democrats. Zohran relished persuasion. A hostile voter was merely an opportunity.\n\nBy 2019, Mr. Mamdani decided to challenge Assembly Member Aravella Simotas, then seen as a rising star of progressive politics. Mr. Mamdani campaigned on making housing more affordable and building renewable energy sources to replace Astorias fossil fuel plants, while criticizing Ms. Simotas for being beholden to the Queens Democratic Party machine. His brigade of DSA volunteers mobilized immigrants and young voters at neighborhood town halls, and then over Zoom when the pandemic canceled in-person events.\n\nThe result of the June 2020 primary was close. After an anxious month waiting for city election officials to count mail-in ballots, Mr. Mamdani edged his opponent by about 300 votes.\n\nMr. Gordillo believes Mr. Mamdani was able to channel voter frustration with housing costs, police violence, and institutional failures during the pandemic into electoral politics.\n\nWe were campaigning on part of Zohran running as a movement candidate, he says. People were drawn to a new kind of politician who isnt just progressive but is committed to being accountable to the people that put them in office.\n\nWhen Mr. Mamdani arrived in Albany in January 2021, he found few friends. The freshman had just defeated a popular legislator and gravitated toward other new lawmakers who had earned DSAs support.\n\nBrooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher says Mr. Mamdani frequently brought colleagues to immigrant-run restaurants around the capital and organized mini-golf and go-kart outings when the weather got warmer.\n\nHes really interested in other people and asks a lot of questions, and hes so charming that he made friends with people from all different political positions, she says. A common problem for him is people falling in love with him because he really makes people feel like hes talking to them and only them.\n\nJohn Lamparski/ Sipa USA/AP/File Sen. Chuck Schumer (left) and State Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani hold hands in victory as New York City Taxi Workers Alliance holds a victory rally by City Hall in celebration of its taxi medallion debt relief program, Nov., 9, 2021. Mr. Mamdani participated in a hunger strike with the taxi drivers.\n\nIn his first year, Mr. Mamdani participated in a 15-day hunger strike with taxi drivers who owed hundreds of thousands of dollars. They reached an agreement with the city to restructure their loans. He partnered with Queens state Sens. Michael Gianaris and Kristen Gonzalez in 2023 to create a one-year free bus pilot in the city. And he sought to eliminate property tax exemptions for private universities and strip state funding for New York charities involved in supporting Israeli settlements.\n\nNow lets talk about governance\n\nLast spring, Mr. Mamdani began to explore a run against Mayor Adams. He would join a crowded field including former Governor Cuomo, who resigned after allegations of sexual harassment from multiple women; two city comptrollers; and two state lawmakers.\n\nJanos Marton, a progressive organizer and chief advocacy officer at Dream.org, hosted Mr. Mamdani at his Staten Island home last fall while the candidate was still polishing his stump speech. Mr. Marton was struck by his charisma and ability to connect with a small group.\n\nHe was going to be the candidate with the clearest defense of the progressive, left-wing approach to governance, Mr. Marton says. There was a real sense that being left-wing was a bad thing to be branded and something to run away from. Other candidates were describing themselves as common-sense moderates, and he was not.\n\nMr. Mamdani launched his campaign in October with a short, crisply edited video promising to freeze rents, speed up buses, and make child care free. He made several more videos speaking with voters about their concerns in multiple languages. He examined why the price of halal chicken and rice had risen to $10, a video viewed on the social platform X 19.2 million times.\n\nBut he was still met with skepticism even by sympathetic colleagues. Last winter, he met Bronx state Sen. Gustavo Rivera for breakfast at a caf in Albany multiple times seeking his endorsement.\n\nI told him for months, I like you, I would love you to be the guy, but you have to show me you can put together a campaign, Mr. Rivera says. I said, Youve built the campaign; now lets talk about governance. You need to connect with people about how these things will be achievable.\n\nAn impromptu confrontation with border czar Tom Homan in March drew notice from Democratic voters far beyond his base. Mr. Homan was visiting Republican lawmakers. A brief video clip of Mr. Mamdani screaming at him about Immigration and Customs Enforcements arrest of Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil while state troopers held him back made headlines. Mr. Khalil was ordered released by a judge last month while the countrys case against him proceeds.\n\nMr. Rivera says the episode was not designed to be a viral moment but that legislators acted out of anger and frustration.\n\nYou look at Zohrans history, and it is not uncommon for him to be on the front lines standing up for people, he says. He shows up for people.\n\nTwo weeks after the clash, Mr. Mamdani had reached the maximum fundraising limit for his primary campaign, collecting $1.7 million from more than 20,000 contributors. (With the citys matching funds program, he brought in more than $8 million.)\n\nHe began rising in the polls. In February, Mr. Cuomo led Mr. Mamdani 33% to 1% in an Emerson College poll. By June, Mr. Mamdani had closed the gap, with Mr. Cuomo ahead 35% to 33%.\n\nBy then, Mr. Cuomo had amassed an enormous war chest, including $25 million for a super political action committee. Mr. Mamdani mobilized an army of 40,000 volunteers who knocked on 1 million doors across the city.\n\nZohran talked about working-class issues like housing, cheaper groceries, and transit instead of focusing on billionaire donors, which gave me a lot of hope, says Matthew Smith, a Fordham student who canvassed for the campaign. It restored hope in Americas democracy that we finally had a candidate who wasnt beholden to billionaire donors or corporations.\n\nEditors note: This article was updated July 2 to include newly released results from New Yorks Board of Elections."

Restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive.\"\n\nOrtberg, who took his post in August after CEO Dave Calhoun left amid intense regulatory pressure, did not identify the exact number of layoffs that would occur but noted that workers at all levels of the business could expect details next week.\n\nMore than 33,000 Boeing workers overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike last month. Nearly 20% of Boeings workforce was suddenly on the picket line. Their union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, cited stagnant wages, safety issues and unfair labor practices as the reason for the work stoppage.\n\nTalks between Boeing and the IAM reportedly broke down earlier this week, and Boeing withdrew its most recent offer to the union. The work stoppage was cited in a news release as a factor in layoffs, delaying and ending the production of several Boeing aircraft.\n\nReps from other Boeing employee unions were disappointed with the layoff news, and the companys pinning of the blame on striking workers, not managerial missteps.\n\nRather than resolve the IAM strike and focus the companys resources on rebuilding the trust of regulators and customers, Boeing leadership has decided to harm every aspect of the company, Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace director Ray Goforth said in a statement to the Seattle Times."

Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\n\nAttorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP\n\nThe parties have resolved their case, Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media trial of the century before it could even begin.\n\nThe groundbreaking settlement represents vindication and accountability, Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.\n\nThe right-wing network said in a statement that it acknowledge[s] the Courts rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false, referring to Davis recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox wont have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\n\nThe $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the companys valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.\n\nFox avoids painful six-week trial\n\nThe last-minute agreement means the closely watched case is over and wont proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\n\nFox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. April 18, 2023. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nThe witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway.\n\nRupert Murdoch thought the election denialism was really crazy, even as Fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers. Carlson said he passionately hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a disaster. Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were kooky, dangerously reckless and mind-blowingly nuts.\n\nThese revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. By settling now, Fox deprived Dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks-long trial.\n\nThis settlement reflects Foxs continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards, Fox said in a statement Tuesday. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\n\nFox News and Fox Corporation  its parent company, which was also a defendant  maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms.\n\nDramatic days in Delaware\n\nSpeculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday.\n\nThe jury selection process wrapped up as planned Tuesday morning, and both sides prepped for opening statements. They even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations. But when the proceedings didnt promptly resume after lunch, the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute, even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom, looking at their phones, and waiting.\n\nThe racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court, ready for their front-row seat to a historic trial. But Davis, the judge, instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement.\n\nYour presence here, short compared to what you thought, and uneventful in a certain sense, was extremely important, Davis said. Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.\n\nMany on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself.\n\nFox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve, Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.\n\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isnt expected anytime soon.\n\nFor its part, Dominion still has pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell. They all deny wrongdoing.\n\nCNNs Liam Reilly and Danny Freeman contributed to this story."

        "content": "Just ahead of the long Independence Day weekend, beaches across the country have closed and issued advisories because of excessive levels of harmful bacteria. The culprit is fecal waste, a common summer problem in both freshwater and oceans that can cause gastrointestinal illness and skin infections.\n\nAt least six states have issued closures or advisories for certain beaches and lakes that have tested positive for above safe levels of fecal bacteria. In Massachusetts, almost two dozen beaches are closed due to excessive bacteria levels. Four beaches in New York are closed. Illinois has issued at least eight advisories in the past few weeks. Los Angeles County had released eight ocean water quality advisories as of Tuesday. Michigan has closed three beaches.\n\nThe bacteria causing havoc for summer swimmers include E.coli and Enterococcus  nasty germs often found in the feces of people and animals. The contamination can occur because of sewage, manure or storm runoff. E.coli is more likely to be found in freshwater, whereas enterococcus can form in both marine and freshwater.\n\nEdward Dudley, director of the E. Coli Reference Center at Pennsylvania State University, said testing bodies of water used for swimming is routine and common, as are closures.\n\nBeach closures are more likely around the summer months, when ocean surface temperatures are high and bacteria can grow more easily, said Antarpreet Jutla, associate professor of environmental engineering sciences at the University of Florida. However, a variety of factors  including human activity, temperature and water movement  can affect bacterial growth, he said.\n\nJutla also said that beach closures due to fecal bacteria are very common.\n\nIn North Carolina, officials warned about cyanobacteria algae blooms in Lake Norman, urging people to keep children and pets away from water that appears bright green, blue or scummy. Different from fecal bacteria, cyanobacteria are the most common cause of algae blooms in freshwater, such as lakes or rivers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research suggests that climate change may be triggering cyanobacterial algae blooms more frequently.\n\nAlthough the Environmental Protection Agency sets guidelines on safe levels of fecal bacteria, states can set their own water quality and monitoring standards. Some, such as Illinois, test public beaches every two weeks.\n\nI would say, the higher the levels, probably the higher the risk, Dudley said.\n\nWhile fecal waste can lead to many harmful diseases, experts are worried by recent increasing levels of another harmful bacteria: vibrio.\n\nVibrio is a potentially deadly bacteria that has caused similar beach closures in recent years. The flesh-eating bug thrives in warm, coastal waters. Jutla, who researches vibrio bacteria, has seen vibrio gradually migrate north across the United State. Testing for vibrio depends on each state as well as its concentration limits, he said.\n\nIts a rare thing right now with increasing trends in the entire country, but thats something that we are really concerned about  what is going to be present in the coastal waters, Jutla said about vibrio.\n\nThe deadly V. vulnificus is a rare type of the bacteria, but infections have been growing in recent years as it follows warming ocean water up the eastern coast of the U.S."

        "content": "MEXICO CITY  A fierce protest in Mexico City railing against gentrification and mass tourism was fueled by government failures and active promotion to attract digital nomads, according to experts, who said tension had been mounting for years.\n\nThe criticism comes after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum alleged that Friday's protest was marked by xenophobia, reviving a debate over an influx of Americans in the city.\n\nMany Mexicans say they've been priced out of their neighborhoods  in part because of a move made by Sheinbaum in 2022, when she was the Mexico City mayor and signed an agreement with Airbnb and UNESCO to boost tourism and attract digital nomads despite concern over the impact short-term rentals could have.\n\n'Gringo: Stop stealing our home'\n\nOn Friday, that came to a head. A largely peaceful protest of hundreds of demonstrators marched through tourism centers of the city with signs reading \"Gringo: Stop stealing our home\" and \"Housing regulations now!\"\n\nNear the end of the march, a group of protesters turned violent, breaking the windows of storefronts and looting a number of businesses. In one case, a protester slammed a butter knife against the window of a restaurant where people were hiding, and another person painted \"kill a gringo\" on a nearby wall.\n\n\"The xenophobic displays seen at that protest have to be condemned. No one should be able to say 'any nationality get out of our country' even over a legitimate problem like gentrification,\" Sheinbaum said Monday. \"We've always been open, fraternal.\"\n\nThe frustrations were built upon years of mass tourism and rising rent prices in large swathes of the city. The influx of foreigners began around 2020, when Americans flooded into the Mexico City to work remotely, dodge coronavirus restrictions and take advantage of cheaper living costs.\n\nIn the years since, choice neighborhoods like Roma and Condesa, lush central areas dotted with cafes and markets, have grown increasingly populated by foreign tourists and the remote workers known as digital nomads, and there are more temporary housing units rented through companies like Airbnb that cater to tourists.\n\nAs they have, rent and living prices have soared and English has been increasingly common on the streets of those areas. Some groups have described the phenomenon as a sort of \"neo-colonialism.\"\n\nMounting tensions\n\nThe Mexico City Anti-Gentrification Front, one of the organizations behind the protest, it was \"completely against\" any acts of physical violence and denied that the protests were xenophobic. Instead, the organization said the protest was a result of years of failures by the local government to address the root of the problems.\n\n\"Gentrification isn't just foreigners' fault, it's the fault of the government and these companies that prioritize the money foreigners bring,\" the organization said in a statement. Meanwhile \"young people and the working class can't afford to live here.\"\n\nIn its list of demands, the organization called for greater rent controls, mandates that locals have a voice in larger development projects in their area, stricter laws making it harder for landlords to throw out residents and prioritizing Mexican renters over foreigners.\n\nMexico's protest comes on the back of a wave of similar protests across Europe railing against mass tourism. Tensions in Mexico have also been compounded by wider inequalities and the Trump administration targeting Latino communities in the U.S. as it ramps up deportations.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security took a jab at protesters Sunday, writing in a post on the social media platform X: \"If you are in the United States illegally and wish to join the next protest in Mexico City, use the CBP Home app to facilitate your departure.\"\n\nGovernment failures\n\nProtesters' cries against government failures were echoed by experts, who said that surging gentrification is a product of both shortage of affordable housing in the city and longtime government failures to regulate the housing market.\n\nAntonio Azuela, lawyer and sociologist and others said that they do see the protest as a xenophobic backlash, and around 2020 the core of the problem was the influx of \"digital nomads\" in the city, but it grew out of hand because of lax housing laws.\n\n\"What has made this explode is lack of regulation in the market,\" Azuela said.\n\nMexico City's government over the course of decades has made a few efforts to control development and create affordable housing.\n\nLegislators estimated there are about 2.7 million houses and apartments in the city, but it needs about 800,000 more. But such affordable housing developments that have popped up often are pushed off to the fringes of the city, said Luis Salinas, a researcher at National Autonomous University of Mexico who has studied gentrification in Mexico City for years.\n\nTaking advantage of 'insufficient' laws\n\nControls, meanwhile, have been marked by lack of enforcement, which developers travel services companies like Airbnb take advantage of, he said.\n\nToday, more than 26,000 properties in Mexico City are currently listed on Airbnb, according to the Inside Airbnb, an advocacy organization that tracks the company's impact on residential communities through data. That's compared to 36,000 properties in New York City and 19,000 in Barcelona, where protests have also broken out.\n\n\"The government has treated housing like it's merchandise,\" Salinas said. The actions the government is taking \"are completely insufficient. The federal government needs to be intervening far more nowadays.\"\n\nAirbnb said it helped contribute more than a billion dollars in \"economic impact\" to Mexico City last year and that spending by guests has supported 46,000 jobs in the city. \"What's needed is regulation based not on prohibitions, but on respect for rights and transparency of obligations,\" it said in a statement.\n\nLast year, Mexico City's government approved the most ambitious rent control law since the 1940s in an effort to control prices and also set caps on short-term rentals to 180 nights a year, but Salinas said that enforcement of short-term rental legislation has been put on pause until after the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAnd even then, the country's government will have to take far greater actions to get the situation under control, said Azuela.\n\n\"This isn't going to end by just reigning in Airbnb,\" he said. \"They're going to have to do a whole lot more.\""

        "content": "My young family and I were in Israel when the military and the Mossad began their offensive operations against Iran on Friday, June 13, commencing what President Trump has since called the 12-Day War. Although the Mossads intelligence and the Israel Defense Forces rapid establishment of air superiority inside Iran proved to be nothing less than extraordinary, my wife and I lived on pins and needles for those first few days of the war. We had to be ready day or night, at a moments notice, to drop everything, grab our 6-month-old baby and race to the houses safe room (that is, bomb shelter).\n\nTrust me: This is not a fun way to live  especially not with an infant. Meanwhile, too many of Irans ballistic missiles  considerably more lethal than the rockets typically fired into Israel from Gaza and Lebanon  were evading Israeli air defense. They were finding their targets. Too many homes were being destroyed, and too many people, tragically, were being killed. Though a proud Jew and Zionist, and even the author of a recent book on Israels fate , I decided to do what any American parent of an infant would do in such a situation: get us home.\n\nI am a Floridian, and I heard about a program the state of Florida had launched to evacuate American citizens from the war zone. We first took a bus to the Jordanian border. We next got to Amman, where we spent the night. We then flew to Cyprus, a hub for those fleeing (and returning to) Israel, where we also spent a night. And finally, we flew from Cyprus to Tampa, where Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis surprised our group by meeting us at the airport .\n\nThe day after my family got home to Florida, the world changed in an instant: Trump ordered Operation Midnight Hammer, delivering a devastating  perhaps fatal  blow to the Iranian regimes three most prized nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. In his brief remarks at the White House following the strikes, Trump repeatedly linked the national interests and fates of the United States and Israel. Despite months of tendentious leaks, palace intrigue and the often-parroted media reports of a rift between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that bilateral relationship is clearly stronger than ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back at both the pre-strike debate and the post-strike fallout, the more interesting question  especially given the hostility toward Trumps move from certain high-profile talking heads within the broader MAGA fold  is perhaps this: Is Midnight Hammer an aberration from Trumps America First foreign policy doctrine, or is it entirely consistent with it?\n\nAs the definitive essay on the topic, a 2019 Foreign Policy magazine article  appropriately titled The Trump Doctrine  from former Trump administration national security official and current State Department Director of Policy Planning Michael Anton put it, Trumps conception of America First means that he has no inborn inclination to isolationism or interventionism, and he is not simply a dove or a hawk. By contrast, Trumps foreign policy instinct is  Jacksonian : It is a strand of pragmatic conservative realism that is intuitively skeptical. The mindset echoes George Washingtons famous farewell address , which warned against getting overly involved overseas, but it also remains able, willing and eager to lash out and strike if necessary to defend core American national interests.\n\nIn short, Trump has no interest in reprising the Bush-era moralistic nation-building enterprise, but he also has no interest in burying Americas head in the sand and pretending that we simply have no interest in events abroad. It was Trump himself, after all, who both withdrew from President Obamas flawed nuclear deal with the Iranian terror regime and eliminated Islamic State founder Abu Bakr Baghdadi and Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general who commanded the Quds Force.\n\nThere are indeed some fools, ignoramuses and scoundrels on the right who keep trying to mislead their MAGA-friendly audiences by imputing to America First views that do not put America first and are not held by the president himself. But they are losing that battle: According to a recent CBS News poll, an astounding 94% of self-identified MAGA Republicans support Operation Midnight Hammer. It certainly seems that in voting for Trump, these Americans favored stopping the worlds No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism  a regime whose raison dtre is eliminating the little Satan of Israel and the big Satan of the United States  from acquiring the worlds most dangerous weapons.\n\nAfter decades of debate about the Iranian nuclear program and months of pearl-clutching about the alleged imminence of World War III, the United States has devastated the illicit nuclear weapons program of a terrorist regime that chants death to America on a daily basis  without a single American casualty, without any extended American troop presence on the ground and with a quick post-strike ceasefire to boot. To achieve a decades-long-sought foreign policy objective in this fashion is nothing less than astonishing. Operation Midnight Hammer is one of the greatest acts of presidential statesmanship and leadership in modern American history.\n\nIts also America First in action. And looking back at the entire ordeal years from now, I strongly suspect it will also make everything my family went through in evacuating the Middle East more than worth it.\n\nAdvertisement"

About 150 police officers, firefighters and emergency personnel were deployed to the scene, police added. The railway line was closed down.\n\nPolice initially said the perpetrator used an axe in the attack but later said he allegedly used a hammer and likely other weapons which they did not further name.\n\nThey identified the suspect as a 20-year-old Syrian national.\n\nThree of the four injured passengers also were Syrians, a boy of 15 and two men aged 24 and 51. The fourth victim was a 38-year-old passenger whose nationality was not yet known, police said. All four injured passengers were taken to nearby hospitals.\n\nPolice did not provide further details on the identity of the attacker or his motive, but later said that he was overpowered by fellow passengers and had also been injured.\n\nThe perpetrator is probably somewhat more seriously injured, a police spokesperson told German news agency dpa. He was in police custody and receiving medical treatment.\n\nAccording to the Bavarian Red Cross, the emergency services were alerted at around 2 p.m. local time, after passengers pulled the emergency brakes. The train came to a halt near the village of Strakirchen, dpa reported.\n\nThe Red Cross said a special care center was set up nearby to take care of passengers. In addition to numerous rescue services and two helicopters, psychological caregivers were deployed to help those who were not injured but might have been traumatized.\n\nGerman rail operator Deutsche Bahn said in a statement that our thoughts and sympathy are with the injured and all those who now have to come to terms with what they have experienced, and thanked emergency services for the quick arrest of the suspect.\n\nGermany has seen several violent attacks in public spaces in recent months.\n\nIn May, a woman stabbed and injured more than a dozen people at Hamburgs central station. In February, a driver plowed into a demonstration in Munich, killing two and injuring more than 20.\n\nIn December, a man killed six and injured more than 200 when he drove a car through a Christmas market in Magdeburg."

        "content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia  Indonesia's rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted Monday, sending a column of volcanic materials as high as 11 miles into the sky and depositing ash on villages.\n\nThe volcano has been at the highest alert level since last month and no casualties were immediately reported.\n\nIndonesia's Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 3 miles down the volcano's slopes during the eruption. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off volcanic earthquakes.\n\nThe column of hot clouds that rose into the sky was the volcano's highest since the major eruption in November 2024 that killed nine people and injured dozens, said Muhammad Wafid, the Geology Agency chief. It also erupted in March.\n\n\"An eruption of that size certainly carries a higher potential for danger, including its impact on aviation,\" Wafid told The Associated Press from Switzerland where he was attending a seminar. \"We shall reevaluate to enlarge its danger zone that must be cleared of villagers and tourist activities.\"\n\nThe volcano monitoring agency had increased the alert status for Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki to the highest level after an eruption on June 18, and more than doubled an exclusion zone to a 4.3-mile radius since then as eruptions became more frequent.\n\nAfter an eruption early last year, about 6,500 people evacuated and the island's Frans Seda Airport was closed. The airport has remained closed since then due to the continuing seismic activity.\n\nThe 5,197-foot mountain is a twin volcano with Mount Lewotobi Perempuan in the district of Flores Timur.\n\nMonday's eruption was one of Indonesia's largest volcano eruptions since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That eruption killed 353 people and forced over 350,000 people to evacuate affected areas.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the \"Ring of Fire,\" a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin."

        "content": "BRICS nations push back as Trump warns of tariffs\n\ntoggle caption Silvia Izquierdo/AP\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil  Brazil's president says the BRICS group of major emerging economies has just concluded its most important summit yet.\n\nBut what was billed as a historic show of strength and unity ended in tension after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs. \"Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,\" he wrote on Truth Social  without clarifying which policies he meant.\n\nThat drew swift pushback from Brazil's President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who hosted the summit and called Trump's comments reckless.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We don't want an emperor, we are sovereign countries,\" Lula said during his closing remarks on Monday, adding: \"It's not right for a president of a country the size of the United States to threaten the world online.\"\n\nThe annual BRICS summitgathering founding members Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, plus new members including Indonesia, Ethiopia and Iranaimed to present a unified Global South alternative to the West.\n\nBut in an apparent attempt to avoid provoking Washington, the group issued a low-key final statement that avoided naming Trump or directly criticizing the U.S. That effort backfired, says Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at Brazil's FGV University.\n\n\"They probably believed they could fly under Trump's radar if they didn't mention the U.S.,\" he said. \"But that clearly failed.\"\n\nBRICS founding member South Africa also jumped into the Trump fray. President Cyril Ramaphosa told journalists at the summit that \"the powerful should not seek vengeance against those working for good in the world.\" China condemned the use of tariffs as coercive diplomacy.\n\nTrump escalated tensions further by publicly supporting Lula's political rival, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently facing trial over his attempts to overturn the 2022 election results. Lula declined to comment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhile sharp words were directed at rising U.S. tariffs and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the group dialed down criticism of its own members. Russia's Vladimir Putin, faced no rebuke over the war in Ukraine. The group's 31-page declaration made only a single reference to the war in Ukraine, condemning \"in the strongest terms\" recent Ukrainian attacks on Russia.\n\nIran was framed not for its nuclear program, but as a victim of Israeli airstrikes. By contrast, Israel was mentioned more than a dozen times, blamed for the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and strikes in Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe summit was also notable for key absences. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, expected to attend before last month's Israeli and U.S. airstrikes, instead sent Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. President Putin, who faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over Ukraine, joined remotely. China's President Xi Jinping was represented by Premier Li Qiang.\n\nThe group's growing diversity is both a strength and a strain: while new members widen its reach, consensus is becoming harder to forge  a fact reflected in a watered-down rebuke of U.S. airstrikes on Iran.\n\nDespite the differences, Lula stood firm on BRICS long-term vision.\n\n\"This is not a club of the privileged,\" he said. \"It's a group of nations trying to organize the world in a different wayfocused on people and development, not conflict.\"\n\nAs Brazil hands over the group's rotating presidency, Lula is urging a renewed focus on climate and development. The summit's conclusion marked a test for the bloc's futureone where balancing global ambition with internal differences, and avoiding Western backlash, remains a delicate balancing act."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Eliot Cohen, a contributing writer at The Atlantic, is a military historian and the founder of the strategic-studies program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). Cohen has written numerous books on military history and strategy, but is perhaps best known for his passionate support of the American invasion of Iraq, which he argued in favor of extensively, both in the late nineteen-nineties, when he was a member of the Project for the New American Century think tank, along with Bill Kristol, John Bolton, and Paul Wolfowitz, and after the 9/11 attacks. In the later years of the George W. Bush Administration, Cohen served in the State Department under Condoleezza Rice. Since then, he has become a so-called Never Trump conservative, regularly attacking the President while continuing to argue for a hawkish foreign policy.\n\nBefore President Donald Trumps order to strike Iran last weekend, Cohen published a piece in The Atlantic pushing for American involvement, and applauding the fact that Trump seemed to be moving toward a military attack. Much as it may pain his critics to admit it, in this matter he is acting, if not conventionally, then like a statesman of a distinctively Trumpian stamp, Cohen wrote. Cohen followed this piece with another article, which ran in The Atlantic on Sunday, after the strike, titled Trump Got This One Right. He explained, Trump got this one right, doing what his predecessors lacked the intestinal fortitude (or, to be fair, the promising opportunity) to do. He spoke with the brutal clarity needed in dealing with a cruel and dangerous regime.\n\nI recently spoke by phone with Cohen about his case for American military action, and his history of support for a proactive American role in the Middle East. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed his skepticism about an American intelligence assessment saying that Trumps strike only set the Iranian nuclear program back by a matter of months, his post-October 7th trip to the Gaza Strip, and the lessons he did and didnt take from the war in Iraq.\n\nWhat have you made of how Trump has handled Iran over the past week, from the strike to the push for a ceasefire?\n\nI was in favor of the strike, and I give him credit. As you know, Ive been about as ferocious a critic of him as one can be. I think I may have been the original Never Trumper, but I think on this one he did the right thing, because this has been a problem brewing for a very long time, and no Administration, including the one I was part of, was really able to deal with it. He seized an opportunity. In terms of damage assessments, my feeling about that, for a whole bunch of reasons, is that it is way too early to tell. But the strike was actually done remarkably well. Trump being Trump, he immediately claimed credit for obliterating the nuclear program. We dont know that. And he has claimed credit for bringing peace, which I very much doubt. But many of us, including close friends, loathe the guy, and its made it impossible for them to recognize a good decision and a desirable outcome.\n\nYou said that other Administrations hadnt been able to deal with this problem. Do you feel like Trump has dealt with the problem?\n\nI think hes done much more than other Administrations. We dont know how much damage has been done by the American strikes, but there was damage done by the Israelis in their covert action, their air strikes, and the American strikes. What I think people have missed is that he has really set a precedent for the use of American military power to go after the Iranian nuclear program. Its really important. We have tried sanctions and negotiations, and they may have, to some extent, slowed the program, but I think its very clear that the Iranians were pressing on.\n\nWhat did you make of Tulsi Gabbard, the director of National Intelligence, saying in March that the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, had not authorized going forward with producing a bomb, and that American spy agencies agreed with that conclusion?\n\nWhat I make of it is the same thing that I made of her statements that Bashar al-Assad was not such a bad guy. Shes a nut case who has no particular grasp on the realities of the situation. She is one of a number of people who never should have been appointed to that position. If [C.I.A. director] John Ratcliffe had said that, I would have taken it more seriously, because hes not a nut case.\n\nWe dont have any reason to believe that she was lying about what the American intelligence community broadly believed, correct?\n\nWe dont have any reason to believe that she was [telling the truth]. And, by the way, the American intelligence community has a pretty mixed track record on this. Intelligence is always difficult. Secondly, on this one, they have an uneven record. Thirdly, the Israelis have had a much better record than we have and theyre motivated because the Iranians want to exterminate them. So between the weirdness and unreliability of Tulsi Gabbard on the one hand and our intelligence communitys record on the other, I dont take anything she says seriously.\n\nI was only saying that we dont have any reason to think that the intelligence community had reached a different conclusion.\n\nWe dont know whether she was accurately rendering what people were saying. We dont know that it was actually a consensus position. [On June 19th, the Times reported that it remains the consensus position of the intelligence community that Iran has not yet decided whether to pursue the manufacture of nuclear bombs; senior officials also told the newspaper that Iran was likely to move toward it if the United States attacked.] It would be a big mistake to think that the top-level judgments are not made with an eye to what you think the political leadership may do that you like or dislike. That was the experience I had in government. So, you know, the intelligence world is murky. Its a murky world. Theres some outstanding people there and there are other people who have political views and act on them.\n\nYou just said that you werent sure how much damage was done by the American strikes on Saturday. You also wrote, on Sunday, For some periodfive years, maybe 10Iran will not have a nuclear option. Did you have a reason to use those numbers, or were you just speculating? The Times and other outlets recently reported, based on a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report, that the strike seems to have only set the program back by a few months.\n\nThat was a preliminary D.I.A. assessment which is not shared by the Israelis. If you look at the Israeli press, youll see that is not the Israeli view. [After Trump began an extraordinary attack on the media for reporting on the D.I.A. assessment, and defended his claim that the Iranian nuclear sites had been obliterated, Ratcliffe released an assessment saying that the American strikes had severely damaged Irans nuclear program. The Times also reported, on Wednesday, that, according to U.S. government officials, should Iran decide to move quickly to get a bomb, it is unlikely to use the facilities struck in the American attack but probably has much of the raw materials and know-how needed to continue.]\n\nI ran the Air Forces study of the first Gulf War. And even like six months or a year later, we were still arguing about the bomb-damage assessments. Its a very difficult task. So it is too soon to know exactly what the result of the Fordo strikes in particular were."

        "bias": "",
        "content": "Israels decision to launch a wide-scale military operation against Iran may have come as a shock to many, but its something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been itching to do for more than decade. The question now is whether President Trump will end up sustaining an Israeli bombing campaign that could last for days, if not weeks.\n\nThe fact that Israel conducted the operation several days before Trumps Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was scheduled to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi for a sixth round of nuclear talks in Oman wasnt lost on most observers.\n\nNetanyahu hasnt been particularly supportive of the Trump administrations diplomatic outreach to the Iranians and reportedly pressed the White House to green-light joint U.S.-Israeli strikes against Tehrans nuclear facilities last month. Trump demurred, choosing diplomacy instead, but Netanyahu seems never to have believed the talks would result in anything substantial.\n\nIsraels negotiating position has long been entirely maximalist: Every nuclear complex on Iranian soil must be destroyed, and under no circumstances could Iran be left with even a rudimentary uranium enrichment capability. Trumps position isnt as definitive as Netanyahus. At times, U.S. officials have talked about striking a deal that would allow the Iranians to continue enriching at a low level with strict, comprehensive international oversight. At other times, Trump has declared that Washington wouldnt sign any deal that allowed Iran to enrich at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious proposals have been floated in the months since those negotiations began, including a regional nuclear consortium involving Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other powers, which could prevent an indigenous Iranian enrichment program but still supply the region with peaceful nuclear energy, and also stem the possibility of an arms race in the Middle East. The Iranians, however, didnt buy into the idea that no enrichment would be permitted on Iranian soil.\n\nIsraels military attack upends the diplomatic chessboard, such as it is, turning the last few months of U.S.-Iran discussions into empty theater. Trump claims he knew what Israel was up to all along and congratulated Netanyahu on the attack. That alone makes it difficult to imagine Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei authorizing his subordinates to continue discussions with the Americans. Doing so would be a very public act of weakness on Tehrans part.\n\nEven so, the White House still expects Iranian officials to show up for the next round of talks. As Trump argued after the initial Israeli salvo, Iran is in no position to refuse anymore. I couldnt get them to a deal in 60 days, Trump said , referring to the Iranians. They were close, they should have done it. Maybe now it will happen.\n\nIn reality, what we are likely to see instead is a collapse of the current diplomatic process and a situation that will be far messier to handle.\n\nIsraeli political and military officials have made it abundantly clear that military operations will persist well into next week and perhaps go on even longer than that. The Iranians, in turn, will feel pressure to continue to retaliate with each passing day, whether its in the form of drones and missiles aimed at Israels air defenses, terrorist attacks on Western targets or sabotaging cargo vessels in the Persian Gulf. In any case, the Middle East is as close to a full-scale war as it has ever been.\n\nThis is a critical moment for the Trump administration, and how it chooses to act in the hours and days ahead will be the determining factor in whether the United States gets dragged into another regional conflagration or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael will do what it believes it needs to do to maintain its security. Even assuming Trump would try to pressure Netanyahu into stopping the bombings  the evidence for that scenario is slim  its hardly guaranteed the Israeli premier would listen. For better or worse, Israels strategic calculus has changed after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. Netanyahu is now far less risk-adverse than during his previous stints in office.\n\nThe United States can only control what it can control. As much as Trump might like to see the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism hammered, he also doesnt want to aid a conflict that could expose tens of thousands of U.S. troops based in the Middle East to imminent risk. Besides, any U.S. involvement in offensive Israeli military operations would be a betrayal of Trumps core supporters and his campaign promises to avoid the fruitless, unending wars. In addition, U.S. offensive involvement would kill any grand diplomatic ambitions Trump may have in the Middle East and nip in the bud the administrations pivot to the Indo-Pacific as China tries to consolidate its power in Asia.\n\nSometimes, the best response to a dangerous situation is to do nothing. It wont satisfy the more hawkish elements in Washington, but lets hope Trump holds his fire.\n\nDaniel R. DePetris is a fellow at Defense Priorities."

On top of launching a home-brewed, web-based TV show, continuing his radio presence, offering up a rather dodgy newsletter, pontificating via Twitter and appearing in several on-air guesting spots, he has declared his intention to avenge what he deemed, a political and financial hit job.\n\nWATCH: This was a hit job.

That came during the arrival of a series of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. As well, OReilly has appeared weekly on Glenn Becks radio show and released a new book last month, one which is now atop The New York Times bestsellers list, The Washington Post reported.\n\nHopefully, if OReilly keeps popping his head out of his hole, there will always someone like Tapper with a mallet waiting."

        "content": "A worker transports plastic waste slated for a compressor in Bentong, Malaysia, in June 2024 before the waste is recycled and sold.\n\nMalaysia will ban plastic waste imports from the U.S. starting Tuesday because of Americas failure to abide by the Basel Convention treaty on international waste transfers, in a move that could have significant consequences for California.\n\nMalaysia emerged as a major destination for U.S. waste after China banned American waste imports in 2018. California shipped 864 shipping containers, or more than 10 million pounds of plastic waste, to Malaysia in 2024, according to the Basel Action Network, an advocacy group. That was second only to Georgia among U.S. states.\n\nUnder Malaysian waste guidelines announced last month, the country will no longer accept plastic waste and hazardous waste from nations that didnt ratify the Basel Convention, the international treaty designed to reduce the international movement of hazardous and other waste. The U.S. is one of just a handful of countries, including Fiji and Haiti, that hasnt signed the pact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalaysia will continue to accept plastic waste from Basel signatories. However, exports from those countries will be subject to pre-inspection at the nation of origin, according to the new guidelines.\n\nSteve Wong, the chief executive of Fukutomi, a Hong Kong-based global plastic recycling company, suggests it is already having an effect on shipping ports.\n\nWith scrap inventories building up at ports and yards, and no clear guidance yet on the enforcement discretion or timeline of Malaysias new system, the market for imported plastic waste has effectively frozen, he wrote in an email to people who follow recycling trends, which was shared with The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of Californias plastic waste is sent overseas. A Los Angeles port spokesman said he was unaware of the impending ban. Long Beach port officials didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAn Oakland port spokesman said that facility hasnt historically seen much volume in this commodity, so we dont anticipate any impact from this change.\n\nWorkers open the door of plastics waste shipment from Australia before sending back to the country of origin in Port Klang on May 28, 2019. A total of 3,000 metric tonnes of contaminated plastic waste will be shipping back to their countries of origin today, signalling Malaysias effort to take the lead in the global crusade against unscrupulous export of scrap. (Photo by (Adli Ghazali/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Wongs email, the coming ban has already disrupted trash export routes significantly, particularly for the plastics used in grocery bags, trash can liners and food wrap.\n\nThe scrap plastics market in Malaysia has come to a virtual standstill amid tightening import regulations and widespread uncertainty ahead of the new control regime taking effect on 1 July 2025, Wong wrote in the email. Recyclers, traders, and suppliers are all reporting minimal or no movement of plastic waste.\n\nJim Puckett of the Seattle-based Basel Action Network cheered Malaysias decision.\n\nThe recycling is doing more harm than good as only a fraction of the exports ever get recycled, said Puckett, the groups founder and chief of strategic direction. The plastics that are not feasible to be recycled are often hazardous, or contain microplastics, which are commonly dumped, burned, or released into waterways. The export of plastic waste for recycling is a complete sham and it is a relief that the U.S. contribution to this plastic waste shell game is increasingly outlawed.\n\nAccording to Californias waste agency, CalRecycle, the state exported 11.3 million tons of recyclable materials overseas to places such as Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico and Canada  in 2022.\n\nThat number includes 100 million pounds of scrap plastic. Although the Basel Action Networks numbers indicate more than 10 million pounds went to Malaysia, CalRecycles 2022 report didnt break down plastic exports to individual nations.\n\nA spokesperson for CalRecycle said that California is working to reduce plastic pollution in our state and around the world and that exports of scrap plastic have significantly declined over the last 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaria West, the agencys communications director, said that in 2018, California exported roughly 421,000 tons, or nearly 842 million pounds of plastic scrap to Malaysia. She said that number dropped 98% in 2024 to 8,000 tons, or about 16 million pounds.\n\nSeveral major waste companies in California, including Athens Services and Recology, didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCritics of Californias waste system say a 1989 state law that requires cities and jurisdictions to divert waste from landfills led to an increase in the export of waste overseas.\n\nUntil 2018, China was the major importer of U.S. plastic waste. However, after China implemented its National Sword policy  which banned the import of most plastic waste  nations began sending their waste elsewhere, often to less economically advantaged nations such as Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.\n\nAlthough some of the plastic is recycled in these nations, much of it is incinerated or placed in landfills, where it chokes rivers and flows into the ocean.\n\nWaste advocates such as the Basel Action Network and participants in the Basel Convention are working to reduce the international movement of contaminated, nonrecyclable plastic from economically advantaged countries, such as the United States, to less advantaged nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJan Dell, the president of LastBeachCleanUp, a Laguna Beach-based anti-plastic waste organization, praised the Malaysian decision.\n\nWere calling on cities, waste companies, brokers, and shipping companies to respect Malaysias sovereign law and STOP all plastic waste shipments, she wrote in an email. The plastic waste must NOT be re-rerouted to other poor countries.\n\nIn 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 54, a landmark plastic law that is designed to establish a circular economy for single-use plastic products and packaging. The law addresses the export of plastic waste and requires product manufacturers to certify that their products are being recycled or composted in ways that reduce environmental pollution and minimize health effects for people who live near where the product is sent.\n\nCalRecycle is currently working on drafting regulations that will enable the implementation of the law, but West, the agencys spokeswoman, said the law requires that for any material to be considered recycled, it must go to responsible end markets, ensuring material actually gets recycled instead of becoming waste in landfills or the environment.\n\n"

        "content": "For South Korea, much of the domestic reaction to Squid Game focused not on plot but on the prestige it has brought to the country.\n\nThe third and final season of Netflixs Squid Game broke viewership records on the streaming platform following its release on June 27, marking a fitting close for what has arguably been the most successful South Korean TV series in history.\n\nAlthough reviews have been mixed, Season 3 recorded more than 60 million views in the first three days and topped leaderboards in all 93 countries, making it Netflixs biggest launch to date.\n\nSquid Game has been transformative for South Korea, with much of the domestic reaction focused not on plot but on the prestige it has brought to the country. In Seoul, fans celebrated with a parade to commemorate the shows end, shutting down major roads to make way for a marching band and parade floats of characters from the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one section of the procession, a phalanx of the shows masked guards, dressed in their trademark pink uniforms, carried neon-lit versions of the coffins that appear on the show to carry away the losers of the survival game. They were joined by actors playing the contestants, who lurched along wearing expressions of exaggerated horror, as though the cruel stakes of the game had just been revealed to them.\n\nAt the fan event that capped off the evening, series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk thanked the shows viewers and shared the bittersweetness of it all being over.\n\nI gave my everything to this project, so the thought of it all ending does make me a bit sad, he said. But at the same time, I lived with such a heavy weight on my shoulders for so long that it feels freeing to put that all down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the overnight global fame Squid Game brought him (its Netflixs most-watched series of all time), Hwang has spoken extensively about the physical and mental toil of creating the show.\n\nVisitors take photos near a model of the doll named Younghee thats featured in Netflixs series Squid Game, displayed at the Olympic park in Seoul in October 2021.\n\n\n\n(Lee Jin-man / Associated Press)\n\nHe unsuccessfully shopped the show around for a decade until Netflix picked up the first season in 2019, paying the director just enough to put food on the table  while claiming all of the shows intellectual property rights. During production for the first season, which was released in 2021, Hwang lost several teeth from stress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA gateway into Korean content for many around the world, Squid Game show served to spotlight previously lesser-known aspects of South Korean culture, bringing inventions like dalgona coffee  made with a traditional Korean candy that was featured in the show  to places such as Los Angeles and New York.\n\nThe show also cleared a path for the global success of other South Korean series, accelerating a golden age of Hallyu (the Korean wave) that has boosted tourism and exports of food and cosmetics, as well as international interest in learning Korean.\n\nBut alongside its worldly successes, the show also provoked conversations about socioeconomic inequality in South Korean society, such as the prevalence of debt, which looms in the backstories of several characters.\n\nA few years ago, President Lee Jae-myung, a longtime proponent of debt relief, said, Squid Game reveals the grim realities of our society. A playground in which participants stake their lives in order to pay off their debt is more than competition  it is an arena in which you are fighting to survive.\n\nIn 2022, the show made history as the first non-English-language TV series and the first Korean series to win a Screen Actors Guild Award , taking home three in total. It also won six Emmy Awards. That same year, the city of L.A. designated Sept. 17  the series release date  as Squid Game Day.\n\nAlthough Hwang has said in media interviews that he is done with the Squid Game franchise, the Season 3 finale  which features Cate Blanchett in a cameo as a recruiter for the games that are the shows namesake  has revived rumors that filmmaker David Fincher may pick it up for an English-language spinoff in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile saying he had initially written a more conventional happy ending, Hwang has described Squid Games final season as a sobering last stroke to its unsparing portrait of cutthroat capitalism.\n\nI wanted to focus in Season 3 on how in this world, where incessant greed is always fueled, its like a jungle  the strong eating the weak, where people climb higher by stepping on other peoples heads, he told The Times Michael Ordoa last month.\n\nComing into Season 3, because the economic system has failed us, politics have failed us, it seems like we have no hope, he added. What hope do we have as a human race when we can no longer control our own greed? I wanted to explore that. And in particular, I wanted to [pose] that question to myself.\n\n"

        "content": "DOJ says no evidence Jeffrey Epstein had a 'client list' or blackmailed associates\n\ntoggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Justice Department and the FBI have found no evidence that disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had a \"client list\" or that he blackmailed prominent associates.\n\nThe conclusions are included in a two-page memo outlining the \"exhaustive review\" the department conducted of the Epstein files in its possession. The memo also states that after a \"thorough investigation,\" the FBI found that Epstein died by suicide, which aligns with previous department conclusions.\n\nThe findings contradict past statements from Attorney General Pam Bondi about an alleged list of Epstein clients. And it's unclear if the memo will tamp down on the continued public skepticism about Epstein's case, particularly his suicide.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEpstein died at a federal lockup in New York City in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. His death has fueled numerous conspiracy theories, particularly on the far right, because of his ties to the wealthy and powerful and the continued speculation surrounding his death.\n\nAxios was the first to report on the memo.\n\nBondi has long promised to release documents from the Epstein investigation. She made public a small batch of files in February, and said the move was part of the administration's \"commitment to transparency and lifting the veil on the disgusting actions of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"\n\nThat same month, she told Fox News in an interview that Epstein's client list was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\"\n\nMore than four months later, the department memo directly contradicts her.\n\n\"This systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list.' There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,\" the memo says. \"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"\n\nAsked Monday about Bondi's previous remarks, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to play down the discrepancy.\n\n\"She was saying the entirety of all the paperwork, all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes,\" Leavitt told reporters. \"That's what the attorney general was referring to, and I'll let her speak for that.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLeavitt added that the attorney general and the FBI director pledged, at Trump's direction, to conduct an exhaustive review of the Epstein materials \"and that's what they did, and they provided the results of that. That's transparency.\"\n\nSuicide in line with prior findings, medical evidence\n\nThe unsigned memo says the FBI and the department went through its investigative files related to Epsteindigital searches of databases, hard drives, network drives and physical searches of cabinets, desks and closetsto find any and all relevant materials.\n\nEpstein's died by suicide on Aug. 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City, according to the memo. It notes that the conclusions is consistent with previous findings, including those of the city's chief medial examiner, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan and the DOJ's inspector general.\n\nIt says the conclusion his death was by suicide is also supported by video footage from the common area of the prison unit where Epstein was being held when he died.\n\n\"Anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located  would have been captured by this footage,\" the memo states. \"The FBI's independent review of this footage confirmed that from the time Epstein was locked in his cell at around 10:40 pm on Aug 9, 2019, until around 6:30 am the next morning, nobody entered any of the tiers.\"\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino have previously raised questions about the official account of Epstein and his death. Since taking top jobs at the bureau, though, they have publicly stated that Epstein killed himself.\n\nBoth men faced backlash online from conspiracy theorists.\n\nThe memo states that there are more than 1,000 victims of Epstein's abuse, and that sensitive information on those individuals is contained in the investigative files. It says that combatting child exploitation and providing justice to victims are top priorities, and that \"perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"To that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government's possession, it is the determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted,\" the memo says.\n\n"

        "content": "LONDON  It was not her best goal or most important soccer match, but when the ball hit the back of the net in Natalie Washington's debut on a women's team in 2017, she felt a sense of belonging that had been missing.\n\nIt was long in coming: Washington had struggled to fit in on a men's team and eventually stopped playing when she decided to transition to being a woman and go through gender-affirming surgery. When she joined a women's team, she quickly felt accepted.\n\nNow, after the United Kingdom's highest court in April said that for anti-discrimination purposes the terms \"woman\" and \"man\" refer to biological sex, Washington's opportunity to play the sport she loves in the league she wants is in doubt.\n\nThe head of the U.K's Equality and Human Rights Commission followed the ruling a day later by saying the court had provided clarity and that transgender women would be excluded from women-only spaces such as toilets, single-sex hospital wards and sports teams.\n\nThe Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in the U.K., followed up by banning transgender players from women's teams in England and Scotland, a ban that took effect at the start of June.\n\n\"It feels like things are being taken away from trans people on an almost daily basis,\" Washington said. \"It's another blow, another kick at a time when people are already hurting.\"\n\nLong a divisive issue\n\nBeyond Britain, inclusion of trans players in sports has long been a divisive issue, with arguments primarily focused on whether it's fair to have athletes born as boys compete against girls and women. In the U.S., it has been particularly politicized, with most Republican-controlled states banning transgender athletes in girls' sports and President Donald Trump signing an executive order to prohibit participation of transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.\n\nThe U.K. court said trans people were still protected from discrimination under British law, such as in employment, housing and education, but the ruling means access to certain single-sex facilities could be curtailed.\n\nTrans rights groups condemned the decision, which is likely to have a profound effect for thousands. Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count.\n\nThe feminist groups who led the legal challenge cheered the ruling and others, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, welcomed the clarity it brought.\n\n\"Everyone knows what sex is and you can't change it,\" said Susan Smith, co-director of For Women Scotland, which brought the case.\n\nA difficult decision\n\nWashington, who leads the group Football v Transphobia, was one of 28 transgender women registered with the Football Association to play amateur soccer. In order to play the women's game, they had to have testosterone levels reduced to the range of biologically born females.\n\nAfter the ruling, the organization changed its rules, saying that although it had aimed to make soccer accessible to as many people as possible, it was always prepared to alter its policy if there were changes in the law or science.\n\n\"We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify,\" the FA said, adding that it would contact transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can remain involved.\n\nSome clubs have responded by finding ways around the ban. Goal Diggers FC, a women and nonbinary inclusive soccer club based in London, has withdrawn from all FA-affiliated leagues.\n\nOn June 1, the day the ban took effect, Goal Diggers hosted an inclusive women's tournament in London, drawing more than 100 players in a show of solidarity.\n\n\"I'll always have a place here and I'll always be a trans woman,\" said Billie Sky, a 28-year-old trans player for Goal Diggers. \"No one can take that away from me.\"\n\nOther voices, other sports\n\nGroups that have campaigned to keep trans athletes from girls' and women's teams, citing a matter of safety and fairness, welcomed the move by the FA.\n\n\"The FA had ample evidence of the harms to women and girls caused by its nonsensical policy of letting men who identify as women play in women's teams,\" said Fiona McAnena of Sex Matters.\n\nGroups that oversee cricket and netball, an offshoot of basketball that is played mainly by women, also limited women's competition to those who were assigned at birth as females.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board said transgender women and girls could continue playing in open and mixed cricket. England Netball said it would allow anyone to play in a new mixed category beginning in September.\n\nHow the ruling came about\n\nThe legal case involved a 2018 Scottish law requiring at least half of the seats on public boards to be held by women. Trans women with certificates recognizing their gender were to be included in meeting the quota.\n\nThe court said that using the certificates to identify someone's gender clashes with the definitions of man and woman. Under the ruling, a transgender person could not claim they had been discriminated against if barred from a single-sex space.\n\nAlexander Maine, a senior lecturer at The City Law School specializing in gender, sexuality and law, said the ruling clouds the value of a document sanctioned by the U.K. Gender Recognition Act that allows them to later update their birth certificate reflecting their acquired gender.\n\n\"There may be a challenge at the European Court of Human Rights brought by trans individuals who say that there is a problem where they may be two sexes at once,\" Maine said.\n\nSomeone could hold \"a gender recognition certificate stating that they are their acquired gender, whereas under the U.K. Equality Act, they are still recognized in their birth gender,\" he said.\n\nWashington and many others say they worry the ruling may lead to more hatred aimed at trans people.\n\n\"For the first time in a long time, I felt scared about how people are going to react to me in public,\" Washington said. \"I don't feel anymore that I can guarantee I have support to turn to from authorities.\""

        "content": "Chances are that relative of yours whos fond of conspiracy theories isnt making any plans for next Saturday, Sept. 23. Thats because its the latest date being promoted as the beginning of the end of humanity.\n\nAccording to Christian astrologer David Meade, the key to understanding all of this is the number 33. In the Bible, Jesus is said to have lived for 33 years before being crucified. Elohim, the Canaanite god who was later adopted as the supreme god of ancient Israel, is mentioned 33 times in the Bible.\n\nAll of this links back to the constellation Virgo and last months solar eclipse which was visible throughout most of the United States, according to Meade.\n\nWhile many in the mainstream Religious Right saw the eclipse as a sign that America needed to repent of its sinful ways, Meade believes it means much more than that.\n\nWhen the eclipse begins on August 21, the sunrise will be dark, just as Isaiah predicts, he told the British tabloid Daily Star last month.\n\nSince the totality of the eclipse was first visible in Oregon, the 33rd state, and ended in South Carolina on the 33rd degree latitude, this means that 33 days after the event, something enormous is going to happen. According to Meade, that enormous event is going to involve Nibiru, a supposed hidden planet with an orbit that is so large, astronomers havent been able to detect it.\n\nNotably, a FoxNews.com article about the Nibiru theory devotes literally one sentence to NASA debunking it, without even so much as a quote. The rest of the piece consists of Bible quotes and a calm recitation of the nonsensical belief.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Meade claimed that the Earth isnt necessarily going to be destroyed on Sept. 23 but rather that the date will kick off the fantastical events depicted in the Book of Revelations in the Bible, including The Rapture, the belief that righteous Christians will be transported into heaven before natural disasters begin destroying much of the planet.\n\nThe world is not ending, but the world as we know it is ending, he said, adding later: A major part of the world will not be the same the beginning of October.\n\nOn his website, Meade is also hawking a book titled The Coup dEtat Against President Donald J. Trump.\n\nOther people have jumped on the Nibiru bandwagon and have created a scary-looking video to describe the theory. Naturally, you can purchase all sorts of materials describing the alleged prophecy in detail.\n\nI tell people that were not saying that the Rapture or the Second Coming is going to happen at such-and-such a date, Nibiru conspiracist Gary Ray said in an interview with Pat Robertsons TV network CBN. Were just saying that the Lord multiple times commanded his people to watch. And he gave signs for a reason. If he didnt want us to pay attention, he wouldnt have given signs.\n\nCurrently, there is no evidence that Nibiru exists, and you dont need the words of a scientist to prove that for yourself. If such a massive object were indeed approaching the Earth at a rapid clip, anyone with a $50 telescope would have seen it coming a long time ago.\n\nNibiru is not real and is not a danger, NASA Senior Space Scientist David Morrison said in a 2012 video debunking an earlier bout of hysteria about the imaginary planet in conjunction with the year 2012, the supposed last year predicted by the ancient Mayan people of Central America.\n\nHe continued: It would be bright. It would be easily visible to the naked eye. If it were up there, you could see it. All of us could see it.\n\nMorrisons clip responding to the fear mongering has only been viewed about 18,000 times. Of this writing, the pro-Nibiru clip above has been viewed over 2 million times."

City news outlets reported that the incident happened after a launch party for the new album by the local rap star Mello Buckzz and that her boyfriend was one of those shot.\n\nThe shooting happened around midnight in Chicagos River North neighborhood. CBS News reported that as people were leaving the album launch party, a black SUV drove up and three people inside opened fire on the crowd.\n\nThe vehicle then immediately drove away and the suspects were still at large, the police said.\n\nI can only describe it as a war zone, Chicago pastor Donovan Price, who responds to communities and people in crisis, told the Associated Press. Just mayhem and blood and screaming and confusion as people tried to find their friends and phones.

The newest, however, might well be record-breaking.\n\nA three-kilometer-long (1.8-mile) cycling and pedestrian tunnel has been blasted through the base of Lvstakken mountain and its makers say its the longest purpose-built tunnel of its kind.\n\nFyllingsdalstunnelen, as its known, opened on April 15 with a family day of sporting activities, following four years of construction that began in February 2019. The state-funded mega-project cost close to $29 million, or 300 million Norwegian kroner.\n\nWe Norwegians are usually modest people, Camilla Einarsen Heggernes, a spokesperson for rail company Bybanen Utbygging, tells CNN, But in this instance we would say that the tunnel is 100% state of the art.\n\nWhen you see this sundial, you'll know you're halfway through. Ronny Tury/Bybanen Utbygging\n\nIt takes a little under 10 minutes to whizz through the tunnel by bike and around 40 if strolling by foot. To break up the monotony of the windowless tunnel, there are a variety of art installations throughout, as well as different colors and lighting to help users place where they are on the journey and offer a sense of direction.\n\nAt the center point is a sundial installation  where the sun definitely will never shine  which shows the time of day, again helping to orientate visitors and also to break up the otherwise long line of sight. The tunnel is otherwise perfectly straight, apart from slight curvatures at entrance and exit.\n\nIf youre wondering how cyclists and pedestrians can use the same space, there are two lanes in the tunnel: a 3.5-meter wide bike lane and a 2.5-meter-wide lane for walkers and runners. We have laid down a blue rubber flooring throughout the tunnel, similar to an athletic track, explains Einarsen Heggernes. This makes it more pleasant to use than if one would just walk on asphalt.\n\nThe tunnel was constructed in parallel with a new tram line. NCC/Bybanen Utbygging\n\nThe new tunnel came about as a byproduct of Bergens second Bybanen tram line, which opened in November 2022. The tram line through the mountain required a parallel evacuation tunnel, so the developers decided to make the new tunnel multipurpose.\n\nBergen is Norways second-largest city and the port city is linked to Oslo, the Norwegian capital, by the 496-kilometer Bergensbanen railway line. This stunning rail journey crosses Europes largest high mountain plateau, the Hardangervidda, and its snow-clad vistas were the backdrop for the battle scenes in the Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nWhile the Fyllingsdalstunnelen is pitching itself as the worlds longest purpose-built cycle tunnel, the reason for that caveat is the 3.6-kilometer-long Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington, just east of Seattle. This former train tunnel is now a passageway for cyclists, runners and walkers and is part of the 250-mile Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail.\n\nSix European cities made it in CNN Travels recent roundup of 10 of the worlds most bike-friendly cities. Copenhagen has 385 kilometers of bike lanes, having introduced its first one way back in 1892. Strasbourg in France has around 6,000 bikes available at self-service stations 24/7 which tourists can use. And the Swiss capital of Bern has a exhilarating downhill trail for riders who feel the need for speed. The best bit is that cyclists can get a funicular up to the top then ride down  no uphill struggle."

Witnesses described a devastating scene with large-scale carnage, as doctors worked feverishly to attend to the dead and injured, many badly burned.\n\nThe hospital is overwhelmed by both dead and wounded, Dr. Mohamed Yusuf, the director of Medina hospital located near the blast, told the Associated Press. We also received people whose limbs were cut away by the bomb. This is really horrendous, unlike any other time in the past.\n\nPhotos and videos of the bombing, which took place on a busy street near a section of the city housing foreign embassies, showed collapsed walls, twisted metal, and sporadic fires spewing smoke. The Qatari government said its embassy was severely damaged in the strike.\n\nThe truck bombing in Mogadishu is the deadliest in conflict-riven Somalia so far.

        "content": "CNN \n\nA German artist has rejected an award from a prestigious international photography competition after revealing that his submission was generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nBerlin-based Boris Eldagsen won the creative open category at this years Sony World Photography Award with his entry Pseudomnesia: The Electrician.\n\nThe eerie black and white image shows two women from different generations  the older woman appearing to hang on to the younger woman from behind.\n\nOrganizers said they were made aware of some AI involvement, but said there had been deliberate attempts to mislead them.\n\nEldagsen said he hoped his actions would open up the conversation around the issue and lead to separate competitions for AI-generated images.\n\nEldagsen said in a statement shared on his website that he had been a cheeky monkey in a bid to open up the conversation around artificially generated images.\n\nThank you for selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it is the first AI generated image to win in a prestigous (sic) international PHOTOGRAPHY competition. How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated? Something about this doesnt feel right, does it?\n\nHe continued: AI images and photography should not compete with eachother in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.\n\nHe said he applied as a cheeky monkey to find out if competitions are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not.\n\nNot about winning\n\nEldagsen told CNN Tuesday: It shows that at the moment the photographic world has been taken by surprise after this development that subtly you can create images that look like photography but you dont need to have the skills and expertise of photographers.\n\nHe said that AI had left many photographers feeling threatened and afraid that they are going to lose their jobs which will happen.\n\nEldagsen said his intention was not to create trouble, but to open up an important conversation.\n\nIt was not about winning anything, he said. I was just making a test to see if they were aware  like a hacker who hacks a system not to exploit it, but to see if there are weaknesses.\n\nIn further statements on his website, he said he had informed the organizers of AI involvement.\n\nOrganizers said that 2023 had seen the highest number of entries in the awards 16-year history. More than 415,000 images were entered across this years competitions, with more than 180,000 of them eligible for the professional categories.\n\nThree finalists, as well as five to seven shortlisted photographers, were chosen in each category. The selected images were shot by photographers from more than 30 countries in locations ranging from an abandoned cement factory in China to a fish market in Somalia.\n\nMisleading claims\n\nThe World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, told CNN in a statement Tuesday that, during the competitions exchanges with Eldagsen ahead of announcing him as a category winner on March 14, he had confirmed the co-creation of this image using AI.\n\nThe creative category of the open competition welcomes various experimental approaches to image making from cyanotypes and rayographs to cutting-edge digital practices, organizers said.\n\nAs such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Additionally, we were looking forward to engaging in a more in-depth discussion on this topic and welcomed Boris wish for dialogue by preparing questions for a dedicated Q&A with him for our website.\n\nAs he [Eldagsen] has now decided to decline his award we have suspended our activities with him and in keeping with his wishes have removed him from the competition. Given his actions and subsequent statement noting his deliberate attempts at misleading us, and therefore invalidating the warranties he provided, we no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.\n\nThe statement said organizers recognize the importance of this subject and its impact on image-making today.\n\nWhile elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium, the World Photography Organisation added.\n\nTop image: Boris Eldagsens AI-generated image titled Pseudomnesia: The Electrician was submitted to the Sony World Photography Awards 2023 and won first prize in the creative open category."

        "content": "Despite a stinging rebuke from a federal judge Thursday, military forces deployed in Los Angeles will remain under presidential control through the weekend, setting up a series of high-stakes showdowns.\n\nOn the streets of Los Angeles, protesters will continue to be met with platoons of armed soldiers. State and local officials remain in open conflict with the president. And in the courts, Trump administration lawyers are digging deep into case law in search of archaic statutes that can be cited to justify the ongoing federal crackdown  including constitutional maneuvers invented to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.\n\nMany legal scholars say the current battle over Los Angeles is a test case for powers the White House has long hoped to wield  not just squelching protest or big-footing blue state leaders, but stretching presidential authority to its legal limit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot rides on what happens this weekend, said Christopher Mirasola, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center.\n\nBy staying the order that would have delivered control of most troops back to California leaders until after the weekend, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals left the Trump administration in command of thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines ahead of the nationwide No Kings protests planned for Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration claimed in court that it had the authority to deploy troops to L.A. due to protesters preventing ICE agents from arresting and deporting unauthorized immigrants  and because demonstrations downtown amounted to rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer of San Francisco wrote Thursday that Trump had steamrolled state leaders when he federalized Californias troops and deployed them against protesters.\n\nHis actions were illegal  both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Breyer wrote.\n\nWhile ICE was not able to detain as many people as Defendants believe it could have, it was still able to uphold U.S. immigration law without the militarys help, Breyer ruled. A few belligerents among thousands of peaceful protesters did not make an insurrection, he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea that protesters can so quickly cross the line between protected conduct and rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States is untenable and dangerous, the judge wrote.\n\nThe 9th Circuit stayed Breyers ruling hours after he issued a temporary restraining order that would have allowed California leaders to withdraw the National Guard soldiers from L.A.\n\nThe pause will remain in effect until at least Tuesday when a three-judge panel  made up of two appointed by President Trump and one by former President Biden  will hear arguments over whether the troops can remain under federal direction.\n\nThe court battle has drawn on precedents that stretch back to the foundation of the country, offering starkly contrasting visions of federal authority and states rights.\n\nThe last time the president federalized the National Guard over the objections of a state governor was in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect Martin Luther King Jr. and the Selma to Montgomery March in defiance of then-Gov. George Wallace.\n\nBut sending troops in to assist ICE has less in common with Johnsons move than it does with President Millard Fillmores actions a century earlier, Mirasola said. Beginning in 1850, the Houston law professor said, Fillmore sent troops to accompany federal marshals seeking to apprehend escaped slaves who had fled north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumps arguments to deploy the National Guard and Marines in support of federal immigration enforcement efforts rely on the same principle, drawn from the take care clause of Article II of the Constitution, Mirasola said. He noted that anger over the militarys repeated clashes with civilians helped stoke the flames that led to the Civil War.\n\nMuch of the population actively opposed enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, the professor said.\n\nSome analysts believe Trump strategically chose immigration as the issue through which to advance his version of the so-called unitary executive theory, a legal doctrine that says the legislature has no power and the judiciary has no right to interfere with how the president wields control of the executive branch.\n\nIts not a coincidence that were seeing immigration be the flash point, said Ming Hsu Chen, a professor at UC Law San Francisco. Someone who wants to exert strong federal power over immigration would see L.A. as a highly symbolic place, a ground zero to show their authority.\n\nChen, who heads his schools Center for Race, Immigration, Citizenship, and Equality , said its clear Trump and his advisers have a vision of how ICE can be emboldened.\n\nHes putting that on steroids, Chen said. Hes folding together many different kinds of excesses of executive power as though they were the same thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome experts point out that Judge Breyers order is limited only to California, which means that until its fully litigated  a process that can drag on for weeks or months  the president may attempt similar moves elsewhere.\n\nThe president could try the same thing in another jurisdiction, said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at NYUs Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nPresident Trumps memorandum to deploy troops in Los Angeles made it very clear he thinks its appropriate  wherever protests are occurring, Goitein said. He certainly seems to think that even peaceful protests can be met with force.\n\nExperts said Breyers ruling set a high bar for what may be considered rebellion under the law, making it harder  if it is allowed to stand on appeal  for the administration to credibly claim one is afoot in L.A.\n\nIts hard to imagine that whatever we see over the weekend is going to be an organized, armed attempt to overthrow the government, Goitein said.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, hasnt budged from its insistence that extreme measures are needed to restore order and protect federal agents as they go about their work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia L.A. law enforcement leaders walk tightrope amid immigration crackdown The LAPD chief said in a department-wide message this week that some officers face conflicting feelings of loyalty, frustration, fear, or sometimes even shame as the community mistakenly views you as part of something that you are not.\n\nThe rioters will not stop or slow ICE down from arresting criminal illegal aliens, the Department of Homeland Security said in a news release this week, which included mugshots of several alleged criminals who had been arrested. Murderers, pedophiles, and drug traffickers. These are the types of criminal illegal aliens that rioters are fighting to protect.\n\nEven after the 9th Circuit decision, the issue could still be headed to the Supreme Court. Some legal scholars fear Trump might defy the court if he keeps losing. Others say he may be content with the havoc wrought while doomed cases wend their way through the justice system.\n\nIts a strange thing for me to say as a law professor that maybe the law doesnt matter, Chen said. I dont know that [Trump] particularly cares that hes doing something illegal.\n\nTimes staff writer Sandra McDonald contributed to this report."

Most artists only ever appear anywhere courtesy of their record label, but Ocean is a free agent and this song is another surprise move in his ongoing rewriting of pop stardom.\n\nLast summer, the buzzy R&B singer broke years of unexplained silence with a duo of albums, Endless and Blond(e), that defied conventions both musically and business-wise. The latter of the two releasesthe one that was actually for sale and had distinguishable songs, in contrast to the free-form streaming audiovisual project Endlessarrived not via his record company, Def Jam, but independently. Through years of wrangling (and the help of Apple, the new corporate patron of label-agnostic pop artists), he had freed himself of the kind of contract that once was considered both prize and necessity for new singers.\n\nIt seemed possible hed then use this newfound liberty to burrow deeper into an anti-commercial, anti-pop mindset. Blond(e) is a masterpiece, but a weird one: mostly free of drums, recognizable song structures, and anything that could be a hit. It took him four years to make, had two competing spellings for its name, and featured a tie-in print magazine. You can understand why its creator might not want to have to run all of his material past Universal Music Groups A&R. And you might guess that future Ocean projects would become even more esoteric.\n\nBut today brings the mostly good news that Ocean has not entirely decided to withhold his talentsa voice that imparts both feeling and attitude, an adventuresome ear, a smart and funny lyrical sensibilityfrom the radio race. Hes paired up with Calvin Harris, the Scottish EDM star famous for unsubtle but irresistible Top 40 fare like This Is What You Came For (his 2016 summer smash, featuring Rihanna) and We Found Love (his 2011 summer smash, featuring, again, Rihanna). Rounding out the bill are two-thirds of Migos, the Atlanta rap group enjoying breakthrough national success in 2017 with the tricky-fun album Culture and the No. 1 hit Bad & Boujee.\n\nHarriss knack for consolidating popular trends and nudging them ever-so-slightly forward is on display here, with the beat for Slide sucking in Bruno Marss recent revivalist funk and Justin Biebers airy tropical house for a blend that will only reveal its full potential when heard on the beach. One of Oceans latter-day signatures, a squeaky manipulated voice, opens the track with the couplet I might empty my bank account / And buy that boy with a pipe, apparently referring to a Picasso painting he wants on his wall.*\n\nThe pairing of artists here is notable more for than musical reasons. Asked about the rapper Makonnen whod just come out as gay, Migos said it seemed fucked up and wack that hed previously put on a tough, streetwise persona. The group later gave an apology that said they were fine with gays but that didnt quite address the stereotypes theyd seemed to endorse. In any case, they are now on a track with Frank Ocean, who shook hip-hop with a 2012 admission of an affair with a manand who has since scrambled all sorts of expectations about culture, machismo, and sex.\n\nMigos themselves sound great, the stickiness of their distinctive flows suddenly plainer than ever over such a sturdy and sunny beat. Oceans verses seem to cryptically, wearily talk about the moment at the end of a night in the club when the lights come up and you see who you might take home; Migoss lyrics are explicit boasts of wining and dining and heterosexual screwing around the world. The divides between Ocean, Migos, and Harriss sensibilities couldnt be clearer, but the song is a reminder of pops power to make very different elements slide together."

        "content": "Editors Note: Justin Lynch is a researcher and analyst in Washington, DC. He is co-author of the book Sudans Unfinished Democracy. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN \n\nFour years ago, almost to the day, the people of Sudan were celebrating a revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Now the East African country faces the possibility of a complete collapse similar to the chaos we see today in Yemen or Libya.\n\nJustin Lynch Courtesy Justin Lynch\n\nOn Saturday, rival military factions began fighting each other in the capital of Khartoum. The two sides battled for control of the nations airports, bases and military compounds. Violence quickly spilled into the streets and across the country.\n\nSome 45 million Sudanese effectively are held hostage and are unable to venture out of their homes for fear of being killed in the crossfire. At least 180 people have perished in the fighting, including three World Food Programme humanitarian workers.\n\nThe conflict pits two bitter rivals and their powerful armed forces against each other. On one side are the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. On the other side are the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti.\n\nThere is no good side in this conflict. Both have been accused of a long litany of human rights violations.\n\nHow did Sudan go from casting off despotic rule and creating a fledgling democracy a few years ago to teetering on the brink of state collapse?\n\nRevolution lost\n\nOn April 11, 2019, Sudans longtime dictator, Bashir, was overthrown. The cause of Bashirs removal was months of protests led by Sudans unions, which spurred a military coup from the SAF and RSF. Both Burhan and Hemeti joined forces to remove their former boss.\n\nIt was a moment of promise because there was hope for democracy. I remember walking around the sit-in  a giant carnival of freedom in the middle of Khartoum that protesters had blocked off to demand change. It was electric.\n\nBut social movements such as the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA)  the union behind the protest  often struggle to translate the momentum of their demonstrations into real political power.\n\nThe reason for this is, in part, structural. Social movements such as the SPA are often based on grassroots activism. A dictator can arrest one or two leaders of an organization but not an entire country.\n\nHowever, once a dictator is overthrown, these kinds of social movements often struggle to build the leadership hierarchy necessary during political negotiations that take place. Like many other movements, Sudans protesters were unable to translate mobilization into political power.\n\nCivilian leaders entered into a negotiation with the military over the future of the country shortly after Bashir fell in April 2019. The two sides were not evenly matched. Because of these leadership challenges, the pro-democracy forces struggled to bargain with the disciplined military.\n\nAny momentum that pro-democracy advocates had during the negotiations was stamped out in June 2019 when RSF soldiers violently dispersed the sit-in. More than 100 people were killed.\n\nAfter the June massacre and the leadership challenges, a transitional constitution was signed in August 2019 that gave the SAF and RSF most of the power in Sudan. Burhan was the head of state, and Hemeti was placed in an elevated political position. Elections were promised in 2022, but few believed they would actually happen.\n\nA legacy of autocracy\n\nThe transitional period began in August 2019, and I interviewed Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister, several times for a book that I co-wrote on Sudans revolution. The way that the constitution was written meant that Hamdok had limited power as the prime minister. Burhan was the head of state and wanted to preserve the powers of the SAF.\n\nHamdok often told me that revolutions come in cycles. The 2019 removal of Bashir was a high point of revolution, and he saw his job as making as many reforms as possible before the low tide of counterrevolution swept him away.\n\nHamdok found that the legacy of 30 years of dictatorship meant that Sudans political and economic models were dilapidated. But Burhan and Hemeti blocked the big reforms that Hamdok wanted to make.\n\nOutside Khartoum violence grew. Parts of Sudan such as Darfur saw a new round of conflict between ethnic groups orchestrated by RSF troops. More than 430,000 people were displaced due to conflict in Sudan, mostly in Darfur.\n\nSoldiers did not hide the atrocities they committed against civilians. I remember drinking tea with a soldier aligned with the RSF at his house in Darfur as he explained why he had recently participated in the burning down of a village from another ethnic group.\n\nThe soldier reasoned that a member of his tribe had been killed in an altercation, so the RSF-aligned forces took revenge by torching a village that had been home to 30,000 people. At least 163 people died.\n\nTensions between the SAF and RSF grew. Burhan viewed Hemeti and his RSF forces as upstart usurpers from Darfur who were undisciplined. Hemeti on the other hand believed that it was time for Darfur to lead Sudan.\n\nHamdok was on the cusp of beginning to turn the economy around when Burhan and the SAF intervened. As we wrote in the book Sudans Unfinished Democracy, the potential success of a civilian government was too much for Burhan. In October 2021, Hamdok was removed in a military coup.\n\nInternational delusion\n\nAfter the October 2021 coup, the United States and United Nations pushed a worse version of the transitional constitution in Sudan. They argued that it was the best way to bring democracy.\n\nThe idea was to restart the transitional period, but I and many others argued it was shortsighted and wouldnt work. Returning to a government led by Burhan was clearly not going to usher in democracy. If the plan ended in a coup the first time, why would it work the second time?\n\nSome activists stopped partnering with the US and came to see the UN mission as a roadblock to democracy because of these policies. I felt sorry when I spoke with the best American and foreign diplomats, who also understood the international policy in Sudan wouldnt work. They saw the flaws but felt powerless to dissent and were forced to carry out decisions made many levels above them.\n\nWhat preceded this weekends outbreak of clashes was a controversial part of the international policy that tried to unify the SAF and RSF. The idea was to make a single army, but neither Hemeti nor Burhan wanted to give up the power they had amassed.\n\nThe plan to unify the military hadnt worked in similar contexts. It was a repeat of the 2013 and 2016 unification processes that took place in South Sudan with similarly bloody results. Instead, the tenuous relationship between Burhan and Hemeti boiled over due to the pressure.\n\nWhats next?\n\nIt can be easy to look at the recent history of revolutions in countries such as Myanmar, Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan and conclude that they eventually backfire. I dont agree. I learned from Sudanese activists that a nations political fortune is an active battle.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe can one day hope that Sudan sees dreams of democracy come true. But right now, the Sudanese people are just hoping to survive the day.\n\nThe lesson from Sudan is that a revolution is only the start of change, not the end."

        "content": "A grand jury has formally charged a 22-year-old man with capital murder and rape in the death of Nabra Hassanen, who was killed on her walk back to a Virginia mosque.\n\nThe Fairfax County Circuit Court indicted Darwin Martinez-Torres of Sterling, Virginia, on Monday on four counts of capital murder for killing Nabra, who was with friends while they had a meal before Ramadan services. Dozens of people had gathered outside the courthouse today, chanting Justice for Nabra.\n\nVirginia law has specific conditions for pursuing the death penalty, but the Associated Press reported that the grand jurys indictment described in graphic detail how Nabras killing was grounds for a death penalty against Martinez-Torres. The indictment appears to acknowledge for the first time that the 17-year-old Muslim teen was raped. Under state law, the combination of a rape charge with a premeditated murder charge means the death penalty can be pursued.\n\nPolice have said that Martinez-Torres, who is an undocumented immigrant, got into a confrontation on June 18 with a group of teens walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society after grabbing a late meal. He is accused of returning later and beating Nabra with a baseball bat. Police said Nabras body was later discovered in a pond. A search warrant affidavit revealed that Martinez-Torres admitted to killing Nabra and had led authorities to where he dumped her body, AP reported.\n\nNabras parents and Muslim advocates have said that Nabras death was motivated by hate, but police has said that they will not treat the killing as a hate crime. Instead, police have said it was a road rage incident.\n\nThe reason this guy he hit my daughter is because shes Muslim, Nabras father Mahmoud Hassanen told WAMU. Why [didnt he] hit the boy who bothered him?\n\nNabras father added that he hoped for the death penalty, while her mother said she wanted Martinez-Torres to serve life in prison.\n\nI just want people to remember her, and dont forget her, Mahmoud told WAMU. I think nobody can forget her too, for what she did in her life.\n\nA preliminary hearing for Martinez-Torres reportedly turned emotional on Friday, with Nabras parents both shouting at the suspect in court. Nabras mother Sawsan Gazzar apparently threw a shoe at Martinez-Torres during the proceedings.\n\nREAD MORE: D.C. memorial for slain Muslim teen was set on fire, officials say"

        "content": "Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe, N.M., in October 2021, a day after Alec Baldwin accidentally shot Halyna Hutchins on the film set.\n\nAlec Baldwin and additional Rust movie producers have agreed to settle a negligence lawsuit brought by three New Mexico crew members who witnessed the 2021 fatal shooting of the films cinematographer.\n\nCrew members Ross Addiego, Doran Curtin and Reese Price filed the lawsuit in 2023, seeking compensation for the trauma they said they suffered after Baldwin accidentally shot Halyna Hutchins. The crew members were setting up their gear in a small wooden church on the movie set when the shooting occurred.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the crew members blamed the tragedy on dangerous cost-cutting and a failure to follow industry safety rules. The movies star, Baldwin, also served as a producer on the low-budget western.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued Baldwin, his El Dorado Pictures company and Rust Movie Productions LLC, alleging negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In the suit, the crew members argued that Baldwin and other producers cut corners, ignored reports of multiple, unscripted firearms discharges, and persisted, rushed and understaffed, to finish the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaldwin and fellow producers have long denied such allegations.\n\nLast week, the two sides asked a New Mexico civil court judge to dismiss the case.\n\nAll claims have been settled and compromised, attorneys for both sides wrote in a joint June 25 motion.\n\nTerms of the proposed settlement were not disclosed. Representatives for the two sides declined to comment.\n\nEach party has agreed to bear its own costs and fees, the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe film was running behind schedule the day of the shooting after camera crew members had walked off the set. The camera technicians have said they were frustrated by inaction over their complaints of a lack of nearby housing, rushed conditions and safety violations, including accidental gun discharges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shooting claimed the life of Hutchins, 42. She died that day, leaving behind her husband, their son and her family in Ukraine. The producers previously settled a wrongful death lawsuit brought on behalf of her husband, Matthew Hutchins.\n\nThe films director, Joel Souza, suffered a gunshot wound. He, Addiego and other crew members testified that they struggled for months with the physical and emotional toll after the shooting.\n\nAddiego was the films dolly operator, responsible for operating the mechanisms for camera movement. Curtin was the set costumer, overseeing costumes and accessories. Price was the key grip, who handled the nonelectric support gear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew Mexico authorities brought three criminal prosecutions, including against Baldwin, who pointed the gun at Hutchins during a setup shot for a close-up of Baldwins prop revolver.\n\nBaldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and his high-profile trial ended abruptly last July after former New Mexico 1st Judicial District Court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the charge.\n\nThe judge found the special prosecutor and Santa Fe County sheriffs deputies had concealed evidence from Baldwins legal team, which the judge said prejudiced the case against Baldwin.\n\nAt the time, the actor-producers team was exploring whether prosecutors and sheriffs deputies botched the investigation into how the bullets made their way onto the desert set.\n\nThe weapons handler Hannah Gutierrez was convicted of involuntary manslaughter following a two-week trial last year. The Arizona woman was released from prison last month after serving 14 months.\n\nAssistant director David Halls was also charged. He pleaded no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon and received a suspended six-month sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaldwin and other producers resumed production of Rust in Montana 18 months after Hutchins shooting. The film was released this spring."

Ron DeSantis and a key architect of the states aggressive immigration enforcement campaign. Mr. Uthmeier helped coordinate the state-funded flights of about 50 Venezuelans to Marthas Vineyard, Massachusetts, in 2022.\n\nIn the eyes of Florida officials, the harsh conditions surrounding the far-flung Everglades airstrip and its nearly 10,500-foot runway make it an ideal location to house and transport migrants.\n\nWe dont need to build a lot of brick and mortar, Mr. Uthmeier said in an interview with conservative media commentator Benny Johnson. And thankfully, Mother Nature does a lot on the perimeter.\n\nTheres really nowhere to go. If youre housed there, if youre detained there, theres no way in, no way out, Mr. Uthmeier added.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to more than double its existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds.\n\nA tax-cutting and budget reconciliation bill approved last month by the U.S. House of Representatives includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation.\n\nDemocrats and activists decry the plan\n\nMore than 50 years ago, environmental advocates, including Marjory Stoneman Douglas, rallied to stop the same stretch of land from being turned into what was to be the largest airport in the world.\n\nNow, activists are rallying to halt what some critics have described as a state-backed heist.\n\nSurrounded by Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve, this land is part of one of the most fragile ecosystems in the country, reads a statement from the advocacy group Friends of the Everglades. Lets not repeat the mistakes of the past. This land deserves lasting protection.\n\nFlorida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost condemned the detention center, calling its apparent use of alligators as a security measure a cruel spectacle.\n\nDonald Trump, his Administration, and his enablers have made one thing brutally clear: they intend to use the power of government to kidnap, brutalize, starve, and harm every single immigrant they can  because they have a deep disdain for immigrants and are using them to scapegoat the serious issues facing working people, Mr. Frost said in a statement.\n\nMaria Asuncion Bilbao, Florida campaign coordinator at American Friends Service Committee, an immigration advocacy group, warned that the health and safety of detainees are being put at risk.\n\nWhats happening is very concerning, the level of dehumanization, Ms. Bilbao said. Its like a theatricalization of cruelty.\n\nMs. Bilbao, who leads a group of immigration advocates who help immigrants at one of the ICE offices in South Florida, said shes concerned about the health risks of the heat and mosquitoes, and the challenges the remoteness of the site presents to community members hoping to protest or monitor activities there.\n\nDHS is backing the initiative\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have applauded the effort and the agencys partnership with Florida.\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the new facility will be funded in large part by the Shelter and Services Program within the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, which is best known for responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.\n\nWe are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American peoples mandate for mass deportations of criminal aliens, said Ms. Noem in a written statement provided to the AP. We will expand facilities and bed space in just days.\n\nManaging the facility via a team of vendors will cost $245 a bed per day or approximately $450 million a year, a U.S. official said. The expenses will be incurred by Florida and reimbursed by FEMA, which has a $625 million shelter and service program fund.\n\nImmigrants arrested by Florida law enforcement officers under the federal 287 (g) program will be held at the facility, as well as immigrants in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.\n\nUnder the revived 287 (g) program, local and state law enforcement officers can interrogate immigrants in their custody and detain them for potential deportation.\n\nMore than 280 such agreements have been signed by agencies across all 67 Florida counties, more than a third of the 720 agreements ICE has reached nationwide.\n\nFlorida is using emergency powers to build the site\n\nState officials are commandeering the land using emergency powers, under an executive order issued by Mr. DeSantis during the administration of then-President Joe Biden to respond to what the governor deemed a crisis caused by illegal immigration.\n\nFlorida is moving forward with the construction on county-owned land over the concerns of Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, local activists, and Native American tribal leaders who consider the area sacred.\n\nBy relying on executive orders, the state is able to sidestep purchasing laws and fast-track the project, which Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried has said amounts to an abuse of power.\n\nThe orders grant sweeping authority to the states head of emergency management, Kevin Guthrie, including the power to suspend any statute, rule, or order seen as slowing the response to the emergency, and the ability to place select law enforcement personnel from across the state under his direct command and coordination.\n\nGovernor DeSantis has insisted that the state of Florida, under his leadership, will facilitate the federal government in enforcing immigration law, a Mr. DeSantis spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nFlorida will continue to lead on immigration enforcement.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

        "content": "Last week, Israel began an extensive bombing campaign on Iran, in what the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has claimed is an attempt to wipe out the countrys nuclear program. Iran has fired back missiles in response, but Israels military superiority has been clear: it has damaged nuclear sites and energy facilities across the country, and has assassinated key figures in Irans military leadership. President Donald Trump, who has for months been saying that he would like to sign a nuclear deal with Iranand who, in 2018, pulled out of the agreement that Barack Obamas Administration had negotiatedhas nevertheless offered significant military and rhetorical support to Israels current campaign. Despite what seemed like some initial reluctance to support an Israeli attack, he has now repeatedly threatened Iran, and its Supreme Leader, and called for an evacuation of Tehran. He has indicated that the United States may formally enter the conflict, perhaps in an effort to destroy Irans Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, which is considered reachable only with American weaponry.\n\nTo weigh this possibility, and to reflect on the United States role in the conflict, I recently spoke by phone with Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He previously worked at the State Department, and played a role in Middle East peace negotiations for decades, most notably at the end of the Clinton Administration. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why Trump decided to support Israels war against Iran, what the Iran conflict reveals about the U.S.-Israeli relationship, and why people continue to misunderstand Trumps approach to foreign policy.\n\nWhat is your understanding, as of now, of how the Trump Administration became embroiled in the conflict between Israel and Iran?\n\nI think it reflects a President who basically does not want a major conflict, and who didnt want to involve the United States in a major conflict, but has not tried or figured out a way to get out of the conflict or to make American intervention less likely. That is his dilemma. Weve got F-35s out there. Weve got Aegis missile systems. Weve got Patriots. Hes given the Israelis a tremendous political margin for support. Hes beaten back many of the MAGA enthusiasts who think that supporting Israel is throwing good money after bad. And he has now even provided rhetorical support.\n\nSo, if he didnt want to get the United States involved, why is he doing these things?\n\nTo Donald Trump, its always a question of, How do I look? Am I being played? Am I being perceived as weak? Did I overcommit or overpromise the possibility of a deal with Iran? I think hes trying to make a virtue out of necessity. But, whenever Trump was briefed that the Israelis were about to strike, he had the capacity and the personality and the power to tell Netanyahu to wait and, at a minimum, to get time.\n\nThe Times reported, on Tuesday, that the Administration felt boxed in, essentially, and that Netanyahu was going to conduct a military assault on Iran regardless. And so, to some degree, they had to go along because they couldnt stop it. You seem to be saying that, in fact, they did have a certain amount of power.\n\nLet me tell you why I think that. Its not a popular view, and its not a view that many people hold. Donald Trump, in the last six weeks, has done things in and around and to Israel that no Republican President and no Democratic President I ever worked for, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, has ever done. He has blown through two of the three basic political laws of gravity that have governed the U.S.-Israeli relationship. One is no daylight. In March, he, without Israels permission, authorized his hostage negotiator to open a dialogue with Hamas, a group that had already killed American citizens and had been responsible for the deaths of Israeli-American dual nationals. He cut a deal with the Houthis without the knowledge of the Israeli Prime Minister, which implicitly said that, as long as you dont attack our naval assets, we have a ceasefire. He didnt say anything about drones and ballistic missiles against Israel. Then, over the objections of Netanyahu, he removed sanctions on the new President of Syria. And he summoned Netanyahu to Washington from Budapest in April. Presumably, the Prime Minister thought he was coming to negotiate down tariffs. And then Trump announces, with the Prime Minister of Israel standing next to him, that hes now opened direct negotiations with Iran. No other American President would have done something in this way. So thats the no-daylight policy being discarded.\n\nSecond is the imperviousness to political costs or consequences. Had a Democratic President done the things that I just identified, somebody would have called for their impeachment. Trumps margin for dealing more independently and more critically with the current Prime Minister of Israel is much larger than any American President has ever had. And this posture dates back to the first Trump term, when he believed that Netanyahu was using him. He doesnt have the same emotional commitment to the idea of Israel, the people of Israel, the security of Israel that Joe Biden had. Israel to him is a means to an end.\n\nThe third political law of gravity thats governed the relationship is aversion to serious and sustained pressure. Despite violating the first two, he wouldnt or couldnt get to No. 3. On an issue of extreme importance to Israel, which involved American equities and interests and potentially American lives, he couldnt bring himself to say, Look, you know, I know you have got to do what you have got to do, but I cant be there for you. I need more time. He may not have said Attaboy and green-lighted this thing, but he clearly didnt say no.\n\nWhen I read the Times piece, I thought, O.K., this is something that weve seen before: an American Administration leaking that they were backed into a corner by the Israelis, that they had no choice. And what you seem to be saying is that Trump and his Administration actually had the political leeway that other American Administrations felt like they did not have, and he just didnt take it. So weve ended up in the same situation that weve ended up in before, even though this could have been avoided without the same political cost.\n\nYeah, Im suggesting to you a counterfactual. And others may say, Oh, dont be ridiculous, Aaron. Trump understood that Iran is a bad actor. There was no doubt in his mind. I dont buy that because I dont think hes committed to Netanyahu. Certainly he doesnt care about the humanitarian situation for Iranians or Palestinians.\n\nLet me put it this way. Trump is now managing three U.S.-mediated conflicts: Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Hamas, Israel-Iran. He has no effective strategy for how to deploy or to even try to deploy U.S. influence or leverage on any of them. He is situational. He is transactional. In the end, he has no strategy. Netanyahu came to him with a plan, and he may have had doubts but he didnt say no. And once the plan was executed he responded with no broader concerns or worries about what the day after is going to look like. I think hes moved away from being a guy who had serious doubts, worried that he was backed into a corner, and now he is, I think, reluctantly committed to, well\n\nHe doesnt seem reluctant in his public comments.\n\nRight, the reluctance is gone, because whats happened is, I think, he respects success and power. The Israelis have demonstrated success and power against a very bad actor. So, having passed up the opportunity to basically say, No, give me more time, hes now contemplating the use of American military force in conjunction with the Israelis. Not to simply add on to what the Israelis are doing but to bring American power to bear, to do the one thing the Israelis cannot do that Americans can: long-range refuelling and massive-ordnance penetrators delivered by B-2 bombers that can be used to go after Irans Fordow reactor. And I would bet in his mind hes not giving up the idea that getting involved could actually somehow translate itself into leverage.\n\nHe could go to Netanyahu and say, Look, you see what I just did? We have to think about the day after and you have to stop. But this is where I think it breaks down. I think the Iranians are going to respond. They have thousands of short-range ballistic missiles. Geography is destiny. Theyve already demonstrated in September, 2019, that they could orchestrate an attack on Saudi oil facilities with cruise missiles and drones. Im not sure what the Iranians will do given the asymmetry of power, but theres a very real possibility that they will strike U.S. assets in Iraq, in Syria, and in the Gulf. So thats the day after."

        "content": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act now before the Senate takes the current preoccupation with making every governmental relationship transactional to an immoral extreme. It puts a $1,000 price tag on the right to seek asylum  the first time the United States would require someone to pay for this human right.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights holds that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution. U.S. law incorporates that right, stating that any alien  irrespective of such aliens status, may apply for asylum. Neither makes this right contingent on being able to pay.\n\nBear in mind that asylum seekers in the United States do not have the right to court-appointed attorneys. That means the system already profoundly disadvantages indigent asylum seekers  they cant afford a lawyer, often dont speak English and have no road map for navigating arcane immigration law.\n\nThe new law would make asylum even more inaccessible for a poor person, in effect, creating two classes of those seeking refuge here. Those wealthy enough to pay $1,000 up front would have their protection claims heard; those unable to pay would be shunted back to face persecution and the problems that drove them from their home countries to begin with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this part of the bill isnt modified before its final passage, Congress will have piled on to the obstacles the Trump administration has already put in place to block the right to seek asylum. On Inauguration Day, President Trump proclaimed an invasion of the United States by millions of aliens and suspend[ed] the physical entry of any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border. Until the president decides the invasion is over, the order explicitly denies the right of any person to seek asylum if it would permit their continued presence in the United States.\n\nSince Jan. 20, asylum seekers trying to enter the United States at the southwestern border have been turned away and, in some cases, loaded onto military planes and flown to third countries  Panama, for example  without any opportunity to make asylum claims.\n\nI asked for asylum repeatedly. I really tried, Artemis Ghasemzadeh, a 27-year-old Christian convert from Iran, told Human Rights Watch after being sent to Panama. Nobody listened to me . Then an immigration officer told me President Trump had ended asylum, so they were going to deport us.\n\nOn top of the basic fee for asylum seekers, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would also require an asylum seeker to pay a fee of not less than $550 every six months to be permitted to work in the U.S. while their claim is pending. The bill would also impose an additional $100 fee for every year an asylum application remains pending in the heavily backlogged system, punishing the person fleeing persecution for the governments failure to provide sufficient immigration judges.\n\nVoices Contributor: Voters wanted immigration enforcement, but not like this Under Biden, no one knew why people were getting into the country. Now no one knows why people are getting thrown out.\n\nChildren are not spared. For the privilege of sponsoring an unaccompanied migrant child, the bill would require the sponsor, often a relative who steps forward to care for the child, to pay a $3,500 fee. Congressional priorities for spending on unaccompanied children who arrive at our borders show a distinct lack of compassion: The bill directs that a $20-million appropriation for U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall only be used to conduct an examination of such unaccompanied alien child for gang-related tattoos and other gang-related markings.\n\nAdd to these barriers the complete shutdown of the U.S. refugee resettlement program, except for white South Africans; the termination of humanitarian parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans; the end of temporary protected status programs that have provided protection to people coming from countries of widespread conflict, and the travel ban that bars entry from some of the worlds top refugee-producing countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Iran and Sudan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, Trump hypes the idea of selling $5-million gold cards for super rich foreigners who want to buy U.S. permanent residence. When asked who might be interested, Trump replied, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.\n\nCalifornia The Trump immigration raids: Stunning, yet predictable Trump vowed throughout his campaign that he would conduct the largest mass deportation in U.S. history. The showdown with Los Angeles was inevitable.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes $45 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcements detention capacity (by my calculations, that would more than triple capacity). It also specifies $14.4 billion for ICE transportation and removal operations, $46.5 billion for the border wall and $858 million to pay bonuses to ICE officials.\n\nWith all the money Congress is prepared to spend, its a wonder the bill didnt add a few dollars for sanding down the inscription at the base of the Statue of Liberty and re-chiseling it to say, Give me your rich and well-rested  yearning to breathe free.\n\nBill Frelick is refugee rights director at Human Rights Watch and the author of the report Nobody Cared, Nobody Listened: The US Expulsion of Third-Country Nationals to Panama."
